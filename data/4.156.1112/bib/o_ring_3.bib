  SUMMARY = {     This series of papers is devoted to the notion of the ordered ring,
 and one of its most important cases: the notion of ordered field. It
 follows the results of \cite{SZMIELEW:1}. The idea of the notion of
 order in the ring is based on that of positive cone i.e. the set of
 positive elements. Positive cone has to contain at least squares of all
 elements, and be closed under sum and product. Therefore the key notions
 of this theory are that of square, sum of squares, product of squares,
 etc. and finally elements generated from squares by means of sums and
 products. Part III contains classification of products of such elements.}}
