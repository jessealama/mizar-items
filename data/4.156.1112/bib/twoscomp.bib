  SUMMARY = {This article introduces various Boolean operators 
which are used in discussing the properties and stability
of a 2's complement circuit.  We present the definitions
and related theorems for the following logical operators
which include negative input/output: 'and2a', 'or2a',
'xor2a' and 'nand2a', 'nor2a', etc.  We formalize
the concept of a 2's complement circuit, define the
structures of complementors/incrementors for binary
operations, and prove the stability of the circuit.}}
