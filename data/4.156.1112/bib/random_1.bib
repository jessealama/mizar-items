  SUMMARY = {In the various branches of science, probability and randomness
  provide us with useful theoretical frameworks.
  The MML has already published some articles concerning the probability,
  \cite{PROB_1.ABS}, \cite{PROB_2.ABS}, \cite{PROB_4.ABS},
   and \cite{RPR_1.ABS}.
  In order to apply those articles, we shall give some theorems concerning
  the probability and the real valued random variables
  to prepare for further studies.}}
