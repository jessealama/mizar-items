  SUMMARY = {A concept of ``Matrix of Complex'' is defined here.
  Addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and product are
  introduced using
  correspondent definitions of ``Matrix of Field''.
  Many equations for such operations consist of a case of
  ``Matrix of Field''. A calculation method of product of
  matrices is shown using a finite sequence of Complex in
  the last theorem.}}
