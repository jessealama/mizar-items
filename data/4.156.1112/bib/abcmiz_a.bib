  SUMMARY = {The aim of this paper is to develop a formal theory of Mizar
  linguistic concepts following the ideas from \cite{Bancerek:2003} and
  \cite{ABCMIZ_1.ABS}. The theory presented is an abstraction from the
  existing implementation of the Mizar system and is devoted to the
  formalization of Mizar expressions.
   The concepts formalized here are: standarized constructor signature,
  arity-rich signatures,
  and unification of Mizar expressions.}}
