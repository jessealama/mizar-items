  SUMMARY = {    We prove some useful schemes of
 existence of real sequences, partial functions from
 a domain into a domain, partial functions from a set
 to a set and functions from a domain into a domain.
 At the beginning we prove some related auxiliary
 theorems related to the article \cite{NAT_1.ABS}.}}
