  SUMMARY = {The article is a continuation of \cite{RLVECT_1.ABS}. 
  As the example of real linear spaces, we introduce the arithmetic addition
  in the set of real sequences and also introduce the multiplication.
  This set has the arithmetic structure which depends on these arithmetic
  operations.}}
