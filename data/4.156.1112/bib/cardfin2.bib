  SUMMARY = {The article provides counting derangements of finite sets
  and counting non bijective functions. We provide a recursive formula
  for the number of derangements of a finite set, together with an
  explicit formula involving the number $e$. We count the number of
  non-one-to-one functions between to finite sets and perform a computation
  to give explicitely a formalization of the birthday problem in terms of
  probability. The article is an extension of \cite{CARD_FIN.ABS}.}}
