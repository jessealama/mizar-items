  SUMMARY = {In this paper, we define Boolean valued functions. Some of their algebraic
 properties are proved. We also introduce and examine the infimum and supremum
 of Boolean valued functions and their properties. In the
 last section, relations between Boolean valued functions and partitions
 are discussed.}}
