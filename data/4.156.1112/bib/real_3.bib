  SUMMARY = {The article introduces simple continued fractions.
    They are defined as an infinite sequence of integers.
    The characterization of rational numbers in terms of
    simple continued fractions is shown. We also give definitions
    of convergents of continued fractions, and several important
    properties of simple continued fractions and their convergents.}}
