  SUMMARY = {The main goal was to prove two facts:
 \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep-3pt
 \item the gauge is the Go-Board of a corresponding cage,
 \item the left components of the complement of the curve determined by
   a cage are monotonic wrt the index of the approximation.
 \end{itemize}
Some auxiliary facts are proved, too.
At the end the new notion needed for the internal approximation are defined
and some useful lemmas are proved.}}
