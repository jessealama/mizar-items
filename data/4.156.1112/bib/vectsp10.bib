  SUMMARY = {The article presents well known facts about quotient vector spaces
  and functionals (see \cite{SLang}). There are repeated theorems and constructions
  with either weaker assumptions or in more general situations
  (see \cite{HAHNBAN.ABS},
  \cite{VECTSP_1.ABS}, \cite{LMOD_7.ABS}). The construction of coefficient
  functionals and non degenerated functional in quotient vector space generated
  by functional in the given vector space are the only new things
  which are done.}}
