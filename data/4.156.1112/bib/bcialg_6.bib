  SUMMARY = {In this article the notion of the power
  of an element of BCI-algebra and its period in the
  book \cite{BCIAlgebras},
  sections 1.4 to 1.5 are firstly given. Then the definition of
  BCI-homomorphism is defined and the fundamental theorem of homomorphism,
  the first isomorphism theorem and the second isomorphism theorem are
  proved following the book \cite{BCIAlgebras2}, section 1.6.}}
