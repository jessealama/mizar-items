  SUMMARY = {In this article we introduced the
    isomorphism mapping between cartesian products of family
    of linear spaces \cite{BOURBAKI:1-5}.
    Those products had been formalized by two different ways,
    i.e., the way using the functor [:X,Y:] and ones using
    the functor  ``product".
    By the same way, the isomorphism mapping was defined
    between cartesian products of family of linear normed spaces also.},
