  SUMMARY = {We introduce the concept of $n$-dimensional  complex space.  We prove a number
of simple but useful propositions concerning addition, nultiplication
by scalars and  similar basic concepts. We introduce metric and topology.
We prove that $n$-dimensional complex space is
a Hausdorff space and that it is regular.}}
