  SUMMARY = {This paper contains some facts and theorems
  relating to the following operations on graphs: union, sum, complement
  and ``embeds''. We also introduce connected graphs to prove
  that a finite irreflexive symmetric N-free graph is a finite
  series-parallel graph. This article continues the formalization
  of \cite{Thomasse}.}}
