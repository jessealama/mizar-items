  SUMMARY = {The article is the second part of a paper proving
   the fundamental Urysohn Theorem concerning the
    existence of a real valued continuous function on
    a normal topological space.
       The paper is divided into two parts. In the first
    part, we introduce some definitions and theorems
    concerning properties of intervals; in the second we
    prove some of properties of dyadic numbers used in
    proving Urysohn Lemma.}}
