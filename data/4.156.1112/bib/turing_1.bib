  SUMMARY = {A Turing machine can be viewed as a simple kind of computer,
   whose operations are constrainted to reading and writing symbols
   on a tape, or moving along the tape to the left or right. 
 In theory, one has proven that the computability
   of Turing machines is equivalent to recursive functions. This
   article defines and verifies the Turing machines of summation and three
   primitive functions which are successor, zero and project functions.
   It is difficult to compute sophisticated functions by simple Turing
   machines. Therefore, we define the combination of two Turing machines.}}
