  SUMMARY = {The goal of the article is to determine the order of the special points
defined in \cite{PSCOMP_1.ABS} on a special polygon. We restrict ourselves
to the clockwise oriented finite sequences (the concept defined in this
article) that start in N-min C (C being a compact non empty subset of
the plane).}}
