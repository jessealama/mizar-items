  SUMMARY = {  This article defines ordered $n$-tuples, projections and Cartesian products 
  for $n=5$. We prove many theorems concerning the basic properties of
  the $n$-tuples and Cartesian products that may be utilized in several
  further, more challenging applications. A few of these theorems are
  a strightforward consequence of the regularity axiom. The article 
  originated as an upgrade of the article \cite{MCART_1.ABS}.}}
