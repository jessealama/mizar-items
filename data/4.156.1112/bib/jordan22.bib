  SUMMARY = {In the paper we formalize some lemmas needed by the proof of the
  Jordan Curve Theorem according to \cite{TAKE-NAKA}.
  We show basic properties of the upper and the lower approximations
  of a simple closed curve (as its compactness and connectedness) and
  some facts about special points of such approximations.}}
