  SUMMARY = {The semantics of the {\tt times} macro is given in \cite{SCMFSA8C.ABS} only
for the case when the body of the macro is parahalting.
We remedy this by defining a new {\tt times} macro instruction in terms
of {\tt while} (see \cite{SCMFSA_9.ABS}, \cite{SCMFSA9A.ABS}).
  The semantics
of the new {\tt times} macro is given in a way analogous to the
semantics of {\tt while} macros.  The new {\tt times} uses an anonymous
variable to control the number of its executions.
We present two examples: a trivial one and a remake of the macro
for the Fibonacci sequence (see \cite{SFMASTR1.ABS}).}}
