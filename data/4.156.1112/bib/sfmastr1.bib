  SUMMARY = {An attempt to use the {\tt Times} macro, \cite{SCMFSA8C.ABS},
was the origin of writing this article.  First, the semantics of the
macro composition as developed in \cite{SCMFSA6A.ABS},
    \cite{SCMFSA6B.ABS}, \cite{SCMFSA6C.ABS}
is extended to the case of macro instructions which are not always halting.
Next, several functors extending the memory handling for
 {\SCMFSA}, \cite{SF_MASTR.ABS}, are defined; they are convenient when
writing more complicated programs.  After this preparatory work, we
define a macro instruction computing the Fibonacci sequence
(see the SCM program computing the same sequence in \cite{FIB_FUSC.ABS})
and prove its correctness.
The semantics of the {\tt Times} macro is given in \cite{SCMFSA8C.ABS} only
for the case when the iterated instruction is parahalting; this is remedied
in \cite{SFMASTR2.ABS}.}}
