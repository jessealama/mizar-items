  SUMMARY = {The paper introduces some preliminary notions concerning
the homotopy theory according to \cite{Greenberg}: paths and
arcwise connected to topological spaces.
The basic operations on paths (addition and
reversing) are defined.
In the last section the predicate: $P, Q$ {\em are homotopic}
is defined. We also showed some properties of the product of
two topological spaces needed to prove reflexivity and symmetry
of the above predicate.}}
