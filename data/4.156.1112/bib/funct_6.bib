  SUMMARY = { A supplement of \cite{CARD_3.ABS} and \cite{FUNCT_5.ABS},
    i.e. some useful and explanatory properties of the product and also
    the curried and uncurried functions are shown. Besides, the functions yielding
    functions are considered: two different products and other operation of 
    such functions are
    introduced. Finally, two facts are presented: quasi-distributivity of
    the power of the set to other one w.r.t. the union
    ($X^{\biguplus_{x}f(x)} \approx \prod_{x}X^{f(x)}$) and
    quasi-distributivity of the product w.r.t. the raising to the power
    ($\prod_{x}{f(x)^X} \approx (\prod_{x}f(x))^X$).}}
