  SUMMARY = {The SCMFSA computer can prove the correctness of
  many algorithms. Unfortunately, it cannot prove the correctness
  of recursive algorithms. For this reason, this article improves
  the SCMFSA computer and presents a Small Computer Model with
  Push-Down Stack (called SCMPDS for short). In addition to
  conventional arithmetic and "goto" instructions, we increase two
  new instructions such as "return" and "save instruction-counter" in
  order to be able to design recursive programs.}}
