  SUMMARY = {In this article, we define the Riemann Integral on functions
  $\mathbbbR$ into $\mathbbbC$ and proof the linearity of this operator.
  Especially, the Riemann integral of complex functions is constituted
  by the redefinition about the Riemann sum of complex numbers.
  Our method refers to the \cite{Murray:1974}.}}
