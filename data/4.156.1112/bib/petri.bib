  SUMMARY = {This article presents the basic place/transition net structure definition
for building various types of Petri nets.  The basic net structure fields
include places, transitions, and arcs (place-transition, transition-place)
which may be supplemented with other fields (e.g., capacity, weight,
marking, etc.) as needed.
  The theorems included in this article are divided into the following
categories:  deadlocks, traps, and dual net theorems.  Here, a dual net
is taken as the result of inverting all arcs (place-transition arcs to
transition-place arcs and vice-versa) in the original net.}}
