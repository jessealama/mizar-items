  SUMMARY = {In this paper, we defined the quadratic residue and proved its 
    fundamental properties on the base of some useful theorems. Then we defined
    the Legendre symbol and proved its useful theorems
    \cite{HuaLooKeng:1957}, \cite{Dexin:1965}. Finally, Gauss Lemma
    and Law of Quadratic Reciprocity are proven.}}
