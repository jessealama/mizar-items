  SUMMARY = {In this article we continue formalizing probability and
  randomness started in \cite{RANDOM_1.ABS}, where we formalized some theorems concerning probability and real-valued random variables.
  In this paper we formalize the variance of a random variable and prove
  Chebyshev's inequality \cite{Goldreich:1998}.
  Next we formalize the product probability measure on the Cartesian product of discrete spaces.
  In the final part of this article we define the algebra of real-valued random
  variables.}}
