  SUMMARY = {A proof of the fact, that
 $\llangle {\Bbb R}, {\rm max}, {\rm min} \rrangle$ is
a lattice (real lattice). Some basic properties (real lattice is
 distributive and modular) of it are proved.
The same is done for the set ${\Bbb R}^A$ with operations:
max($f(A)$) and min($f(A)$), where ${\Bbb R}^A$ means the
set of all functions from $A$
(being non-empty set) to $\Bbb R$, $f$ is just such a function.}}
