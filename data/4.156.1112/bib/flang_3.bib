  SUMMARY = {This is the second article
  on regular expression quantifiers.
  \cite{FLANG_2.ABS} introduced the quantifiers
  $m$ to $n$ occurrences and optional occurrence.
  In the sequel, the quantifiers: at least $m$ occurrences
  and positive closure (at least 1 occurence) are introduced.
  Notation and terminology were taken
  from \cite{WALL-CHRISTIANSEN-ORWANT:2000},
  several properties of regular expressions from \cite{WAITE-GOOS:1984}.}}
