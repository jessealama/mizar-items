  SUMMARY = {Third of a series of articles laying down the bases for classical first order model theory. 
Interpretation of a language in a universe set. Evaluation of a term in a universe. Truth evaluation of an atomic formula. 
Reassigning the value of a symbol in a given interpretation.
Syntax and semantics of a non atomic formula are then defined concurrently. As a consequence, the evaluation of any wff string and the relation of logical implication are introduced. Depth of a formula.
Definition of satisfaction and entailment (aka entailment or logical implication) relations, cfr \CITE{ebbinghaus1994mathematical} III.3.2 and III.4.1 respectively.
