  SUMMARY = {This article is concerned with a generalization of concepts introduced
in \cite{RVSUM_1.ABS}, i.e., there are introduced the sum and the product of
finite number of elements of any field. Moreover, the product of vectors
which yields a vector is introduced.
According to \cite{RVSUM_1.ABS}, some operations on $i$-tuples of elements of
field are introduced: addition, subtraction, and complement.
Some properties of the sum and the product of finite number of elements of
a field are present.}}
