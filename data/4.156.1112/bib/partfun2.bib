  SUMMARY = {The value of a partial function from a domain
to a domain and a inverse partial function are introduced. The value and inverse function
were defined in the article \cite{FUNCT_1.ABS}, but
new definitions are introduced.
 The basic properties of the value, the inverse partial function,
the identity partial function, the composition of partial functions, the $1{-}1$
partial function, the restriction of a partial function, the image,
the inverse image and the graph are proved.
Constant partial functions are introduced, too.}}
