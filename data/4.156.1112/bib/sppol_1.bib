  SUMMARY = {First, extremal properties of endpoints of line segments in
n-dimensional Euclidean space are discussed.  Some topological
properties of line segments are also discussed.
   Secondly, extremal properties of vertices of special polygons
which consist of horizontal and vertical line segments in
2-dimensional Euclidean space, are also derived.}}
