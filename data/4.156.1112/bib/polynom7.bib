  SUMMARY = {In this article we give some technical concepts for multivariate
polynomials with arbitrary number of variables. Monomials and constant
polynomials are introduced and their properties with respect to the
eval functor are shown. In addition, the multiplication of polynomials with
coefficients is defined and investigated.}}
