  SUMMARY = {In this paper we define the algebra of formal power series and the algebra of
polynomials over an arbitrary field and prove some properties of these
structures. We also formulate and prove theorems showing some general
properties of sequences. These preliminaries will be used for defining and
considering linear functionals on the algebra of polynomials.}}
