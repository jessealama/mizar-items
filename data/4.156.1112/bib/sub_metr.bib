  SUMMARY = {    Definitions of pseudometric space, nonsymmetric metric
 space, semimetric space and ultrametric space are introduced. We find some
 relations between these spaces and prove that every ultrametric space is
 a metric space. We define  the relation {\it is between}. Moreover
 we introduce the notions of the open segment and the closed segment.}}
