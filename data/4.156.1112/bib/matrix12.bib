  SUMMARY = {This article describes definitions of Line and Column
     Operations of Matrices and some main
     properties \cite{Lipschutz:1968}.For example,Interchange
     the ith Line(Column) and the jth Line(Column),Multiply the
     ith Line(Column) by a nonzero scalar k,Replace the ith
     Line(Column) by k times the jth Line(Column) plus
     the ith Line(Column),etc.}}
