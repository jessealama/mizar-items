  SUMMARY = {Basing on the definitions from \cite{WAITE-GOOS:1984},
  semi-Thue systems, Thue systems, and direct derivations are introduced.
  Next, the standard reduction relation is defined that, in turn,
  is used to introduce derivations using the theory from \cite{REWRITE1.ABS}.
  Finally, languages generated by rewriting systems are defined as all strings
  reachable from an initial word. This is followed by the introduction
  of the equivalence of semi-Thue systems with respect to the initial word.}}
