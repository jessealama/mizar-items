  SUMMARY = {We continue Mizar formalization of General Topology
    according to the book \cite{ENGEL:1} by Engelking.
    Niemytzki plane is defined as halfplane $y \geq 0$
    with topology introduced by a neighborhood system.
    Niemytzki plane is not $T_4$. Next, the definition of Tychonoff
    space is given. The characterization of Tychonoff space by prebasis
    and the fact that Tychonoff spaces are between $T_3$ and $T_4$ is proved.
    The final result is that Niemytzki plane is also a Tychonoff space.}}
