  SUMMARY = {An inner product of complex numbers is defined and used to
 characterize the (counter-clockwise) angle between ($a$,0) and (0,$b$)
 in the complex plane.  For complex $a$, $b$ and $c$ we then define the
 (counter-clockwise) angle between ($a$,$c$) and ($c$, $b$) and prove
 theorems about the sum of internal and external angles of a triangle.}}
