  SUMMARY = {The article is a continuation of \cite{ANPROJ_6.ABS}. In the
classes of projective spaces, defined in terms of collinearity,
introduced in the article \cite{ANPROJ_3.ABS}, we distinguish the
subclasses of Pappian projective structures. As examples of these
types of objects we consider analytical projective spaces defined over
suitable real linear spaces.}}
