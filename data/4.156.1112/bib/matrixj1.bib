  SUMMARY = {In this paper we present basic properties of block diagonal
    matrices over a set. In our approach the
    finite sequence of matrices in a block diagonal matrix is not restricted to
    square matrices. Moreover, the off-diagonal blocks need not be zero
    matrices, but also with another arbitrary fixed value.}}
