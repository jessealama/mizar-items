  SUMMARY = {The information that all members of a set enjoy a property expressed
 by an adjective can be processed in a systematic way. The purpose
 of the work is to find out how to do that. If it works, `membered'
 will become a reserved word and the work with it will be automated.
 I have chosen {\it membered} rather than {\it inhabited} because of
 the compatibility with the Automath terminology.
 The phrase $\tau$ {\it inhabits}
 $\theta$ could be translated to $\tau$ {\bfseries\itshape is}
 $\theta$ in Mizar.}}
