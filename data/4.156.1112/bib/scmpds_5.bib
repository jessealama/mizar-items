  SUMMARY = {In this article, a program block without halting instructions
  is called No-StopCode program block. If a program consists of two blocks,
  where the first block is parahalting (i.e. halt for all states) and
  No-StopCode, and the second block is parahalting and shiftable,
  it can be computed by combining the computation results of the two blocks.
  For a program which consists of a instruction and a block, we obtain
  a similar conclusion. For a large amount of programs, the computation
  method given in the article is useful, but it is not suitable to recursive
  programs.}}
