  SUMMARY = {The authors have presented some articles about
    Lebesgue type integration theory. In our previous articles,
    we assumed that some sigma additive measure existed and
    that a function was measurable on that measure.
    However the existence of such a measure is not trivial.
    In general, because the construction of a finite additive
    measure is comparatively easy, to induce a sigma additive measure
    a finite additive measure is used. This is known as an
    E.~Hopf's expansion theorem of measure \cite{Halmos74}.}}
