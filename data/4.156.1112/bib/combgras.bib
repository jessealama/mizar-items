  SUMMARY = {In the paper we construct the configuration $G$ which is a partial
  linear space. It consists of $k$-element subsets of some base set as
  points and $k+1$-element subsets as lines. The incidence is given
  by inclusion. We also introduce automorphisms of partial linear
  spaces and show that automorphisms of $G$ are generated by permutations
  of the base set.}}
