  SUMMARY = {We formalize the notion of the prime-power factorization of a
  natural number and prove the Fundamental Theorem of
  Arithmetic. We prove also how prime-power factorization can be used to
  compute: products, quotients, powers, greatest common divisors and
  least common multiples.}}
