  SUMMARY = {Set operations for sequences of subsets are introduced here.
  Some relations for these operations with the limit of
  sequences of subsets, also with the inferior sequence and
  the superior sequence of sets, and with the inferior limit and
  the superior limit of sets are shown.}}
