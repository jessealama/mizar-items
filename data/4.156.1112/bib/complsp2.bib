  SUMMARY = {A concept of "the inner product and conjugate of finite
      sequences of complex numbers" is defined here. Addition, subtraction,
      Scalar multiplication and inner product are introduced using
      correspondent definitions of "conjugate of finite sequences of Field".
      Many equations for such operations consist like a case of
      "conjugate of finite sequences of Field".
      Some operations on the set of $n$-tuples of complex numbers
      are introduced as well. Addition, difference of such $n$-tuples,
      complement of a $n$-tuple and multiplication of these
      are defined in terms of complex numbers.}}
