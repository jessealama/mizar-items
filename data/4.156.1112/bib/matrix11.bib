  SUMMARY = {In this paper we present basic properties of the determinant of
      square matrices over a field and selected properties of the sign of a
      permutation.
      First, we define the sign of a permutation by the requirement
      $${\rm sgn}(p)=\prod_{1\leq i<j \leq n}\,{\rm sgn}(p(j)-p(i)),$$
      where $p$ is any fixed permutation of a set with $n$ elements.
      We prove that the sign of a product of two permutations is the same
      as the product of their signs and
      show the relation between signs and parity of permutations.
      Then we consider the determinant of a linear combination of
      lines, the determinant of a matrix with permutated lines and the
      determinant of a matrix with a repeated line.
      At the end, we prove that the determinant of a product of two square
      matrices is equal to the product of their determinants.}}
