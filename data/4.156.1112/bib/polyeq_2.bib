  SUMMARY = {In this paper, we describe the definition of the 
fourth degree algebraic equations and their properties.
We clarify the relation between the four roots of
this equation and its coefficient. Also, the form of these roots
for various conditions is discussed. This solution is known
as the Cardano solution.}}
