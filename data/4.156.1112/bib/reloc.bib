  SUMMARY = {This article defines the concept of relocating the program
part of a finite partial state of {\bf SCM} (data part stays intact). The
relocated program differs from the original program in that all jump
instructions are adjusted by the relocation factor and other instructions
remain unchanged.
The main theorem states that if a program computes a function then
the relocated program computes the same function, and vice versa.}}
