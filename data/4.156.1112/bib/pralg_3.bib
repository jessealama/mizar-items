  SUMMARY = {This article is continuation of an article defining products of many
sorted algebras \cite{PRALG_2.ABS}. Some properties of notions such as
commute, Frege, Args() are shown in this article.
Notions of constant of operations in many sorted algebras and projection of
products of family of many sorted algebras are defined.
There is also introduced the notion of class of family of many sorted algebras.
The main theorem states that product of family of many sorted algebras and
product of class of family of many sorted algebras are isomorphic.}}
