  SUMMARY = {In the MML article \cite{NT_7.ABS} has proven that the
    multiplicative group $Z/pZ^{*}$ is cyclic group. Likewise, finite
    subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic group.
    However, finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field
    being a cyclic group has not yet been proven. Therefore, it is of
    importance to prove that finite subgroup of the multiplicative
    group of a field is cyclic group. Meanwhile, in cryptographic
    system like as RSA, in which security basis depends upon the
    difficulty of factorization of given numbers into prime factors,
    it is important to employ integers that are difficult to be
    factorized into prime factors. If both $p$ and $2p+1$ are prime
    numbers, we call $p$ as Sophie Germain Prime, and $2p+1$ as Safe
    Prime. It is known that the product of two Safe Primes is a
    composite number that is difficult for some factoring algorithms
    to factorize into prime factors. In addition, Safe Primes are also
    important in cryptography system because of their use in discrete
    logarithm based techniques like Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
    If $p$ is a Safe Prime, the multiplicative group of numbers modulo
    $p$ has a subgroup of large prime order. However, no definitions
    have not been established yet with the Safe Prime and Sophie
    Germain Prime. So it is important to give definitions of the
    Sophie Germain Prime and Safe Prime. In this article, we prove
    finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic
    group, and, further, define the Safe Prime and Sophie Germain
    Prime, and prove several facts about them. In addition, we define
    Mersenne number, and some facts about Mersenne numbers and prime
    numbers are proven. A Mersenne number is a natural number in the
    form of $2^{n}-1$, where n is a natural number. }}
