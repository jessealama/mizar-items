  SUMMARY = { If $V$ is any non-empty set of sets, we define $\hbox{\bf Ens}_V$ to be
    the category with the objects of all sets $X \in V$, morphisms of all
    mappings from $X$ into $Y$, with the usual composition of mappings.
    By a mapping we mean a triple $\langle X,Y,f \rangle$ where
    $f$ is a function from $X$ into $Y$.
    The notations and concepts included corresponds to that presented
    in \cite{SEMAD}, \cite{MacLane:1}.
    We also introduce representable functors to illustrate properties of
    the category {\bf Ens}.}}
