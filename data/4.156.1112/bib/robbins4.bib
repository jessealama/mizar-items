  SUMMARY = {The main result of the article is the solution to the problem
    of short axiomatizations of orthomodular ortholattices.
   Based on EQP/Otter results \cite{McCune:2005},
   we gave a set of three equations
   which is equivalent to the classical, much longer equational
   basis of such a class.
   Also the basic example of the lattice which is not orthomodular,
   i.e. benzene (or $B_6$) is defined in two settings -- as a relational
   structure (poset) and as a lattice. \par
   As a preliminary work, we presented the proofs of the dependence
   of other axiomatizations of ortholattices. The formalization of
   the properties
   of orthomodular lattices followed \cite{Beran:1984}.}}
