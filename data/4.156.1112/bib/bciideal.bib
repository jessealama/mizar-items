  SUMMARY = {In this article three classes of Ideals is descussed:
            associative ideals, commutative ideals, implicative ideals
            and positive implicative ideals and the elementary properties
            of them.Some of their properties and the relationship between
            them are not proved yet, and they will be finished
            in the following article.}}
