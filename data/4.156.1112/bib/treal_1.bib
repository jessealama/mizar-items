  SUMMARY = {The aim is to prove, using Mizar System, the following
simplest version of the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem \cite{BROUWER:1}.
 {\em For every continuous mapping $f : {\Bbb I} \rightarrow {\Bbb I}$ of the
topological unit interval $\Bbb I$ there exists a point $x$ such that
 $f(x) = x$} (see e.g. \cite{DUG-GRAN:1}, \cite{BROWN:1}).}}
