  SUMMARY = {We mean by an internal approximation of a simple closed curve
a special polygon disjoint with it but sufficiently close to it, i.e.
such that it is clock-wise oriented and its right cells meet the curve.
We prove lemmas used in the next article to construct a sequence
of internal approximations.}}
