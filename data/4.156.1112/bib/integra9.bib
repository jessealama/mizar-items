  SUMMARY = {In this article, we give several integrability formulas of some
        functions including trigonometric function and index function
        \cite{Chuanzhang:1978}. We also give the definitions of
        orthogonal polynomial and norm function, and some of their
        important properties \cite{Renhong:1999}.}}
