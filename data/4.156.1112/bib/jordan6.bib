  SUMMARY = {The goal of the article is to introduce an order
on a simple closed curve. To do this, we fix two points on
the curve and devide it into two arcs. We prove that such a
decomposition is unique.
   Other auxiliary theorems about arcs are proven for preparation of the
proof of the above.}}
