  SUMMARY = {Let $X$ be a topological space and let $D$ be a subset of $X$.
 $D$ is said to be {\em discrete}\/ provided for every subset
 $A$ of $X$ such that $A \subseteq D$ there is an open
subset $G$ of $X$ such that $A = D \cap G$\/
(comp. e.g., \cite{KURAT:2}).  A discrete subset $M$ of $X$ is
said to be {\em maximal discrete}\/ provided for every discrete
subset $D$ of $X$ if $M \subseteq D$ then $M = D$.
A subspace of $X$ is {\em discrete}\/ ({\em maximal discrete})
iff its carrier is discrete (maximal discrete) in $X$.\par
 Our purpose is to list a number of properties of
discrete and maximal discrete sets
in Mizar formalism. In particular, we show here that {\em if $D$
is dense and discrete then $D$ is maximal discrete}; moreover,
 {\em if $D$ is open and maximal discrete then $D$ is dense}.
We discuss also the problem of the existence of maximal discrete
subsets in a topological space.\par
 To present the main results we first recall a definition of a class
of topological spaces considered herein. A topological space $X$ is
called {\em almost discrete}\/ if every open subset of $X$ is closed;
equivalently, if every closed subset of $X$ is open.
Such spaces were investigated in Mizar formalism in
 \cite{TDLAT_3.ABS} and \cite{TEX_1.ABS}.
 We show here that {\em every almost discrete space contains a maximal
discrete subspace and every such subspace is a retract of the enveloping
space}. Moreover, {\em if $X_{0}$ is a maximal discrete subspace of
an almost discrete space $X$ and $r : X \rightarrow X_{0}$ is
a continuous retraction, then $r^{-1}(x) = \overline{\{x\}}$ for every
point $x$ of $X$ belonging to $X_{0}$}.
This fact is a specialization, in the case of almost
discrete spaces, of the theorem of M.H. Stone that every topological
space can be made into a $T_{0}$-space by suitable identification
of points (see \cite{STONE:3}).}}
