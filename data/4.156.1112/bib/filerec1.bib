  SUMMARY = {This article is a continuation of \cite{FINSEQ_8.ABS}.
     We present a notion of files and records. These are two finite
     sequences. One is a record and another is a separator for the
     carriage return and/or line feed. So, we define a record.
     The sequential text file contains records and separators.
     Generally, a record and a separator are paired in the file.
     And in a special situation, the separator does not exist in the file,
     for that the record is only one record or record is nothing.
     And the record does not exist in the file, for that some separator
     is in file. In this article, we present some theory for files
     and records.}}
