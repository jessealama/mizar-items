  SUMMARY = {An extension of \cite{LOPBAN_1.ABS}.
  In this article, the basic properties of
  complex linear spaces which are defined by the set of all complex linear
  operators from one complex linear space to another are described.
  Finally, a complex Banach space is introduced.
  This is defined by the set of
  all bounded complex linear operators, like in \cite{LOPBAN_1.ABS}.}}
