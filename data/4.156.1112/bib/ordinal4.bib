  SUMMARY = {Concatenation of two ordinal sequences,
the mode of all ordinals belonging to a universe and
the mode of sequences of them with length equal to the rank of 
the universe are introduced.
Besides,
the increasing and continuous transfinite sequences,
the limes of ordinal sequences and
the power of ordinals, and
the fact that every increasing and continuous transfinite sequence has
critical numbers (fixed points) are discussed.}}
