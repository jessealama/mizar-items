  SUMMARY = {We develop a higher level terminology for the {\bf SCM}
machine defined by Nakamura and Trybulec in \cite{AMI_1.ABS}.
Among numerous technical definitions and lemmas we define
a complexity measure of a halting state of {\bf SCM} and
a loader for {\bf SCM} for arbitrary finite sequence of instructions.
In order to test the introduced terminology we discuss properties
of eight shortest halting programs, one for each instruction.}}
