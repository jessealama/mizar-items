  SUMMARY = {     We introduce properties of a series of nonnegative
 $\overline{\Bbb R}$  numbers, where  $\overline{\Bbb R}$ denotes 
 the enlarged set of real numbers,
 $\overline{\Bbb R} = {\Bbb R} \cup \{-\infty,+\infty\}$.
     The paper contains definition of  sup $F$ and inf $F$, for $F$ being
function, and a definition of a sumable subset of $\overline{\Bbb R}$. We proved the basic
theorems regarding the definitions mentioned above.
The work is the second part of a series of articles concerning
the Lebesgue measure theory.}}
