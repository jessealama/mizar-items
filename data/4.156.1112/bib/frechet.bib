  SUMMARY = {This article contains a definition of three classes of topological spaces:
first-countable, Frechet, and sequential. Next there are some facts about them, that
every first-countable space is Frechet and every Frechet space is sequential.
Next section contains a formalized construction of topological space which is
Frechet but not first-countable. This article is based 
on \cite[pp. 73--81]{ENGEL:1}.}}
