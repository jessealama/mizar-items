  SUMMARY = {We present a Borsuk's theorem published first in \cite{BORSUK:3} (compare also
    \cite[pages 119--120]{BORSUK:2}).  It is slightly generalized, the assumption of
    the metrizability is omitted. We introduce concepts needed for the formulation
    and the proofs of the theorems on upper semi-continuous decompositions,
    retracts, strong deformation retract. However, only those facts that
    are necessary in the proof have been proved.}}
