  SUMMARY = {This paper is a continuation of the formalisation of \cite{CCL} pp.~108--109.
Order-consistent and upper topologies are defined. The theorem that the Scott
and the upper topologies are order-consistent is proved. Remark 1.4 and
example 1.5(2) are generalized for proving this theorem.}}
