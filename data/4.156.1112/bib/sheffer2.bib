  SUMMARY = {We continue the description of Boolean algebras in terms of
   the Sheffer stroke as defined in \cite{SHEFFER1.ABS}.
   The single axiomatization for BAs in terms of disjunction
   and negation was shown in \cite{ROBBINS2.ABS}.
   As was checked automatically with the help of automated
   theorem prover Otter, single axiom of the form
   $$(x | ((y | x) | x)) | (y | (z | x)) = y\quad{\rm (Sh1)}$$
   is enough to axiomatize the class of all Boolean algebras
   ($\upharpoonright$ is used
   instead of $|$ in translation of our Mizar article).
   Many theorems in Section 2
   were automatically translated from the Otter proof object.}}
