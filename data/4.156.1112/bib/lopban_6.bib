  SUMMARY = {In this article we formalize one of the most important
             theorems of linear operator theory the Open Mapping Theorem
             commonly used in a standard text book such as \cite{miyadera:1972}
               in chapter 2.4.2.
             It states that a surjective continuous linear
             operator between Banach spaces is an open map.}}
