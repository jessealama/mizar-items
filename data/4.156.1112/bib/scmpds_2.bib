  SUMMARY = {The article defines the SCMPDS computer and its
  instructions. The SCMPDS computer consists of such instructions
  as conventional arithmetic, ``goto'', ``return'' and
  ``save instruction-counter''
  (``saveIC'' for short). The address used in the ``goto'' instruction is an
  offset value rather than a pointer in the standard sense. Thus, we
  don't define halting instruction directly but define it by ``goto 0''
  instruction. The ``saveIC'' and ``return'' equal almost call and return
  statements in the usual high programming language. Theoretically,
  the SCMPDS computer can implement all algorithms described by
  the usual high programming language including recursive routine.
  In addition, we describe the execution semantics and halting
  properties of each instruction.}}
