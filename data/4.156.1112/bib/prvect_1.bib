  SUMMARY = {In the first section we present properties of fields and Abelian groups in
terms of commutativity, associativity, etc. Next, we are concerned with
operations on $n$-tuples on some set which are generalization of operations
on this set. It is used in third section to introduce the $n$-power
of a group and the $n$-power of a field. Besides, we introduce a concept of
indexed family of binary (unary) operations over some indexed family of sets
and a product of such families which is binary (unary) operation on a product
of family sets. We use that product in the last section
to introduce the product of a finite sequence of Abelian groups.}}
