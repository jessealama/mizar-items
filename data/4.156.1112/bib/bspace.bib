 SUMMARY = {For each set $X$, the power set of $X$ forms a
               vector space over the field $F_{2}$ (the two-element
               field $\{0,1\}$ with addition and multiplication
               done modulo $2$): vector addition is disjoint union,
               and scalar multiplication is defined by the two equations
               ($1 \cdot x := x$, $0 \cdot x := \emptyset$ for subsets
               $x$ of $X$).  See \cite{kelley}, Exercise 2.K, for
               more information.},
