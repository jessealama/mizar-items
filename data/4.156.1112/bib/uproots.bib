  SUMMARY = {We present a formalization of the factor theorem for univariate
  polynomials, also called the (little) Bezout theorem: Let $r$ belong to a
  commutative ring $L$ and $p(x)$ be a polynomial over $L$. Then $x-r$
  divides $p(x)$ iff $p(r) = 0$.  We also prove some consequences of
  this theorem like that any non zero polynomial of degree $n$ over an
  algebraically closed integral domain has $n$ (non necessarily distinct)
  roots.}}
