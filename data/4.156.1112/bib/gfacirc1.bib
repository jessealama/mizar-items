  SUMMARY = {We formalize the concept of the Generalized Full Addition
and Subtraction circuits (GFAs), define the structures of calculation
units for the redundant signed digit (RSD) operations, and prove the 
stability of the circuits. Generally, one-bit binary full adder assumes
positive weights to all of its three binary inputs and two outputs.
We obtain four type of 1-bit GFA to constract the RSD arithmetic logical
units that we generalize full adder to have both positive and negative
weights to inputs and outputs.}}
