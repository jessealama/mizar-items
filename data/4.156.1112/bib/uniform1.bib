  SUMMARY = {For mappings from a metric space to a metric space, a notion of
uniform continuity is defined. If we introduce natural topologies
to the metric spaces, a uniformly continuous function becomes continuous.
    On the other hand, if the domain is compact, a continuous function
is uniformly continuous. For this proof, Lebesgue's covering lemma is
also proved.
    An arc, which is homeomorphic to [0,1], can be divided into small
segments, as small as one wishes.}}
