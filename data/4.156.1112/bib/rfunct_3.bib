  SUMMARY = {The article consists of two parts. In the first one
    we consider notion of nonnegative and nonpositive part of a real numbers.
     In the second we consider partial function from a domain to the set of
    real numbers (or more general to a domain). We define a few new operations
    for these functions and show connections between finite sequences of real
    numbers and functions which domain is finite. We introduce 
    {\em integrations} for finite domain real valued functions.}}
