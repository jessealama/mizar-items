  SUMMARY = {In this paper we present selected properties of barycentric
             coordinates in the Euclidean topological space. We prove the
	     topological correspondence between a subset of an affine closed
	     space of ${\cal E}^n$ and the set of vectors created from
	     barycentric coordinates of points of this subset.}}
