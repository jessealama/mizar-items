  SUMMARY = {This article formalizes the proof of Dynkin's lemma in
   measure theory. Dynkin's lemma is a useful tool in measure theory
   and probability theory: it helps frequently to generalize a
   statement about all elements of a intersection-stable
   set system to all elements of the sigma-field generated by that system.}}
