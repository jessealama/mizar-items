  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalized Lebesgue's Convergence theorem
    of complex-valued function.
  We proved Lebesgue's Convergence Theorem of real-valued function
  using the theorem of extensional real-valued function.
  Then applying the former theorem to real part and imaginary part
  of complex-valued functional sequences,
  we proved Lebesgue's Convergence Theorem of complex-valued function.
  We also defined partial sums of real-valued functional sequences and
  complex-valued functional sequences and showed their properties.
  In addition, we proved properties of complex-valued simple functions.}}
