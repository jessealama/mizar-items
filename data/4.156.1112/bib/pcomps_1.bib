  SUMMARY = {      We give an example of a compact space.
    Next we define a locally finite subset family of a topological space and
    a paracompact topological space. An open sets family of a metric space we
    define next and it has been shown that the metric space with any open sets
    family is a topological space. Next we define metrizable space.}}
