  SUMMARY = {First, equivalence conditions for connectedness
  are examined for a finite topological space
  (originated in \cite{Nakamura:2}).
  Secondly, definitions of subspace, and components
  of the subspace of a finite topological space are given.
  Lastly, concepts of continuous finite sequence and minimum path
  of finite topological space are proposed.}}
