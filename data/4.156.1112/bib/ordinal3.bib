  SUMMARY = {At the beginning the
article contains some auxiliary theorems concerning the constructors
defined in papers \cite{ORDINAL1.ABS} and \cite{ORDINAL2.ABS}.
Next simple properties of addition and multiplication
of ordinals are shown, e.g. associativity of addition.
Addition and multiplication of a transfinite sequence of ordinals and
a ordinal are also introduced here.
The goal of the article is the proof that the distributivity of multiplication
wrt addition and the associativity of multiplication hold.
Additionally new binary functors of ordinals are introduced:
subtraction, exact division, and remainder and some of their basic
properties are presented.}}
