  SUMMARY = {The line of points $a$, $b$, denoted by $a\cdot b$ and the point of lines
 $A$, $B$ denoted by $A\cdot B$ are defined. A few basic theorems related to these
notions are proved. An inspiration for such approach comes from so called
Leibniz program. Let us recall that the Leibniz program is a
program of algebraization of geometry using purely geometric
notions. Leibniz formulated his program in opposition to
algebraization method developed by Descartes.}}
