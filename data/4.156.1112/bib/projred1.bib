  SUMMARY = {  The article begins with basic facts concerning arbitrary projective spaces.
Further we are concerned with Fano projective spaces (we prove it has rank
at least four). Finally we restrict ourselves to Desarguesian planes; we
define the notion of perspectivity and we prove the reduction theorem for
projectivities with concurrent axes.}}
