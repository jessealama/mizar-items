  SUMMARY = {The goal of this article is to examine the effectiveness of ``for-loop''
  and ``while-loop'' statements on SCMPDS by insert sort. In this article,
  first of all, we present an approach to compute the execution result of
  ``for-loop'' program by ``loop-invariant'', based on Hoare's axioms for program
  verification. Secondly, we extend the fundamental properties of
  the finite sequence and complex instructions of SCMPDS. Finally, we prove
  the correctness of the insert sort program described in the article.}}
