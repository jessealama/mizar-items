  SUMMARY = {The concept of indexing of a category (a part of indexed category,
see \cite{TarleckiBurstallGoguen})
is introduced as a pair formed by a many sorted category and a many 
sorted functor.
The indexing of a category $C$
against to \cite{TarleckiBurstallGoguen} is not a functor but
it can be treated as a functor from $C$ into some categorial category
(see \cite{CAT_5.ABS}).
The goal of the article is to work out the notation necessary to define
institutions (see \cite{GoguenBurstall}).}}
