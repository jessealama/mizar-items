  SUMMARY = {The article includes the proof of the contraction lemma
which claims that every class in which the axiom of extensionality
is valid is isomorphic with a transitive class. In this article
the isomorphism (wrt membership relation) of two sets is defined.
It is based on \cite{MOST:1}.}}
