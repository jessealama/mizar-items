  SUMMARY = {This article introduces labelled state transition systems,
  where transitions may be labelled by words from a given alphabet.
  Reduction relations from \cite{REWRITE1.ABS} are used
  to define transitions between states, acceptance of words,
  and reachable states. Deterministic transition systems are also defined.}}
