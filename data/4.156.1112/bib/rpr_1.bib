  SUMMARY = {Definitions of Elementary Event and Event in
any sample space $E$ are given. Next, the probability of an Event
when $E$ is finite is introduced and some properties of this function
are investigated. Last part
of the paper is devoted to the conditional probability and 
essential properties of this function (Bayes Theorem).}}
