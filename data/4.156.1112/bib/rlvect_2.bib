  SUMMARY = {The article is continuation of \cite{RLVECT_1.ABS}. At the beginning we
prove some theorems concerning sums of finite sequence of vectors.
We introduce the following notions: sum of finite subset of vectors,
linear combination, carrier of linear combination, linear combination
of elements of a given set of vectors, sum of linear combination.
We also show that the set of linear combinations is a real linear space.
At the end of article we prove some auxiliary theorems that should be
proved in
 \cite{BOOLE.ABS}, \cite{FUNCT_1.ABS}, \cite{FINSET_1.ABS}, \cite{NAT_1.ABS}
or \cite{REAL_1.ABS}.}}
