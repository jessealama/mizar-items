  SUMMARY = {In this paper we show the finite dimensionality of real linear
  spaces with their carriers equal REAL n.
  We also give the standard basis of such spaces.
  For the set REAL n we introduce the concepts of linear manifold subsets
  and orthogonal subsets. The cardinality of orthonormal basis in REAL n is
  proved to equal n.}}
