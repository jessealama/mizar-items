  SUMMARY = {It is known that commutative BCK-algebras form a variety, but
  BCK-algebras do not \cite{BCIAlgebras}.
  Therefore H.~Yutani introduced the notion of
  quasi-commutative BCK-algebras. In this article we first present the
  notion and general theory of quasi-commutative BCI-algebras. Then we
  discuss the reduction of the type of quasi-commutative BCK-algebras
  and some special classes of quasi-commutative BCI-algebras.}}
