  SUMMARY = {We introduce the notion of weak directed geometrical bundle.
We prove representation theorems for directed and weak directed geometrical
bundles which establishes a one-to-one correspondence between such structures
and appropriate 2-divisible abelian groups. To this aim we construct over
arbitrary weak directed geometrical bundle a group defined entirely in terms
of geometrical notions -- the group of (abstract) ``free vectors".}}
