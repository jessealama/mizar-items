  SUMMARY = {Let $X$ be a topological space.
 $X$ is said to be {\em $T_{0}$-space}\/ (or {\em Kolmogorov space})
provided for every pair of distinct points $x,\,y \in X$ there exists
an open subset of $X$ containing exactly one of these points
(see \cite{ALEX-HOPF}, \cite{KURAT:2}, \cite{ENGEL:1}). Such spaces
and subspaces were investigated in Mizar formalism in \cite{TSP_1.ABS}.
A Kolmogorov subspace $X_{0}$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be
{\em maximal}\/ provided for every Kolmogorov subspace $Y$ of $X$
if $X_{0}$ is subspace of $Y$ then the topological structures of
 $Y$ and $X_{0}$ are the same.\par
 M.H.~Stone proved in \cite{STONE:3} 
that every topological space
can be made into a Kolmogorov space by identifying points with the same
closure (see also \cite{THRON:1}). The purpose is to generalize the
Stone result, using Mizar System. It is shown here that: (1) {\em in every
topological space $X$ there exists a maximal Kolmogorov subspace $X_{0}$
 of $X$}, and (2) {\em every maximal Kolmogorov subspace $X_{0}$ of
 $X$ is a continuous retract of $X$}.
Moreover, {\em if $r : X \rightarrow X_{0}$ is a continuous
retraction of $X$ onto a maximal Kolmogorov subspace $X_{0}$
of $X$, then $r^{-1}(x) = {\rm MaxADSet}(x)$ for any point $x$ of $X$
 belonging to $X_{0}$, where ${\rm MaxADSet}(x)$ is a unique maximal
anti-discrete subset of $X$ containing $x$} (see \cite{TEX_4.ABS}
for the precise definition of the set ${\rm MaxADSet}(x)$).
The retraction $r$ from the last theorem is defined uniquely, and it is denoted
in the text by ``Stone-retraction". It has the following two remarkable
properties: $r$ is open, i.e., sends open sets in $X$ to open sets in
 $X_{0}$, and $r$ is closed, i.e., sends closed sets in $X$ to closed sets
in $X_{0}$.\par
These results may be obtained by the methods described by R.H. Warren
in \cite{WARREN:1}.}}
