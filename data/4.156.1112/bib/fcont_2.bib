  SUMMARY = {The uniform continuity for real functions is introduced.
More theorems concerning continuous functions are given. (See \cite{FCONT_1.ABS})
The Darboux Theorem is exposed. Algebraic features for uniformly
continuous functions are presented. Various facts, e.g., a continuous
function on a compact set is uniformly continuous are proved.}}
