  SUMMARY = {The goal of this article is to prove a scalar multiplicity of Riemann
definite integral. Therefore, we defined a scalar product to the subset
of real space, and we proved some relating lemmas. At last, we proved
a scalar multiplicity of Riemann definite integral.
As a result, a linearity of Riemann definite integral was proven by unifying
the previous article \cite{INTEGRA1.ABS}.}}
