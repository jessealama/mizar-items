  SUMMARY = {This is the next article in a series devoted to homotopy theory
  (following \cite{BORSUK_2.ABS} and \cite{BORSUK_6.ABS}).
  The concept of fundamental groups of pointed topological spaces
  has been introduced. Isomorphism of fundamental groups defined
  with respect to different points belonging to the same component has been stated.
  Triviality of fundamental group(s) of ${\Bbb R}^n$ has been shown.}}
