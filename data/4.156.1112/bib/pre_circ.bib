  SUMMARY = {    This article is the first in a series of four articles (continued
    in \cite{MSAFREE2.ABS},\cite{CIRCUIT1.ABS},\cite{CIRCUIT2.ABS})
    about modelling circuits by many-sorted algebras.\par
    Here, we introduce some auxiliary notations and prove auxiliary
    facts about many sorted sets, many sorted functions and trees.}}
