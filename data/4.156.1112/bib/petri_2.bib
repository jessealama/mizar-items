  SUMMARY = {Based on the Petri net definitions and theorems already
  formalized in the Mizar article "Basic Petri Net Concepts",
  we developed the concept of "Cell Petri Nets" with this article.
  It is based on \cite{Kawamoto and Nakamura:1996}.
  In a cell Petri net we introduce the notions of colors and colored
  states of a Petri net, connecting mappings for linking two
  Petri nets, firing rules for transitions, and the synthesis
  of two or more Petri nets.}}
