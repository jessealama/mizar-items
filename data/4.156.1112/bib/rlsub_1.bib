  SUMMARY = {  The following notions are introduced in the article: subspace of a
real linear space, zero subspace and improper subspace, coset of a subspace.
   The relation of a subset of the vectors being linearly closed is also
introduced.
  Basic theorems concerning those notions are proved in the article.}}
