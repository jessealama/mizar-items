  SUMMARY={In this article, we define the Riemann integral on functions from
  $\mathbbbR$ into real normed space and prove the linearity of
  this operator.
  As a result, the Riemann integration can be applied to a wider
  range of functions. The proof method follows the \cite{Murray:1974}.}}
