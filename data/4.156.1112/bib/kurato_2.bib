  SUMMARY = {In the paper we give formal descriptions of the two Kuratowski
  limit oprators: Li $S$ and Ls $S$, where
  $S$ is an arbitrary sequence of subsets of a fixed topological
  space.
  In the two last sections we prove basic properties
  of these lower and upper topological limits, which
  may be found e.g. in \cite{KURAT:2}.
  In the sections 2--4, we present three operators
  which are associated in some sense with the above mentioned, that
  is lim inf $F$, lim sup $F$, and limes $F$, where $F$ is
  a sequence of subsets of a fixed 1-sorted structure.}}
