  SUMMARY = {    Basic properties of the least common multiple
    and the greatest common divisor. The lattice of natural numbers
    (${\rm L}_{\Bbb N}$)
    and the lattice of natural numbers greater than zero
    (${\rm L}_{\Bbb N^+}$) are constructed.
    The notion of
    the sublattice of the lattice of natural numbers is given.
    Some facts about it are proved.
    The last part of the article deals with some properties of prime numbers
    and with the notions of the set of prime numbers and the $n$-th prime
    number. It is proved that the set of prime numbers is infinite.}}
