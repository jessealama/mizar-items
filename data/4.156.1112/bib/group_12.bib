  SUMMARY = {In \cite{GROUP_7.ABS} it was formalized that
    the direct product of a family of groups gives a new group.
    In this article, we formalize that for all $j$ \in I$,
    the group $G =\Pi_{i \in I} G_i$ has a normal subgroup
    isomorphic to $G_j$. Moreover we show some relations
    between a family of groups and its direct product.}}
