  SUMMARY = {In this paper, we showed the linearity of the
    indefinite integral
     $\int_a^b f dx$, the form of which was introduced in \cite{INTEGRA5.ABS}.
    In addition, we proved some theorems about the integral calculus on the
    subinterval of $[a,b]$. As a result, we described the fundamental
    theorem of calculus, that we developed in \cite{INTEGRA5.ABS}, by a
    more general expression.}}
