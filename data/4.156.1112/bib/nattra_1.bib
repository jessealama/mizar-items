  SUMMARY = {      We present well known concepts of category theory: natural transformations
    and functor categories, and prove propositions related to. Because of
    the formalization it proved to be convenient to introduce some auxiliary
    notions, for instance: transformations. We mean by a transformation of
    a functor $F$ to a functor $G$, both covariant functors from $A$ to $B$,
    a function mapping the objects of $A$ to the morphisms of $B$ and assigning
    to an object $a$ of $A$ an  element of $\mathop{\rm Hom}(F(a),G(a))$.
    The material included roughly corresponds to that presented on pages
    18,129--130,137--138 of the monography (\cite{SEMAD}).
    We also introduce discrete categories and prove some propositions
    to illustrate the concepts introduced.}}
