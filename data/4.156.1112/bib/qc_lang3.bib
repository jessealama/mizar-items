  SUMMARY = {We develop the first order language defined in \cite{QC_LANG1.ABS}.
We continue the work done in the article \cite{QC_LANG2.ABS}.
We prove some schemes of defining by structural induction.
We deal with notions of closed subformulae and of still not bound variables
in a formula. We introduce the concept of the set of all free variables
and the set of all fixed variables occurring in a formula.}}
