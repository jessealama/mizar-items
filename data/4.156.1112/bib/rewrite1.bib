  SUMMARY = {The goal of the article is to start the formalization
of Knuth-Bendix completion method (see \cite{BachmairDershowitz},
     \cite{KlopMiddeldorp} or \cite{HofLinCS};
     see also \cite{KnuthBendix},\cite{Huet81}),
i.e. to formalize the concept of the completion
of a reduction relation.
The completion of a reduction relation $R$ is
a complete reduction relation equivalent to $R$ such that
convertible elements have the same normal forms.
The theory formalized in the article includes concepts and facts
concerning normal forms, terminating reductions, Church-Rosser property,
and equivalence of reduction relations.}}
