  SUMMARY = {The following theorem is due to Dilworth~\cite{Dilworth50}:
  Let $P$ be a partially ordered set. If the maximal number
  of elements in an independent subset (anti-chain) of $P$ is $k$, then $P$
  is the union of $k$ chains (cliques).\par
  In this article we formalize an elegant proof of the above theorem for
  finite posets by Perles~\cite{Perles63}.  The result is then used in
  proving the case of infinite posets following the original proof of
  Dilworth~\cite{Dilworth50}.\par
  A dual of Dilworth's theorem also holds: a poset with maximum clique $m$
  is a union of $m$ independent sets.  The proof of this dual fact
  is considerably easier; we follow the proof by Mirsky~\cite{Mirsky71}.
  Mirsky states also a corollary that a poset of $r \times s + 1$
  elements possesses a clique of size $r+1$ or an independent set of
  size $s+1$, or both.  This corollary is then used to prove the
  result of Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres~\cite{ES35}.\par
  Instead of using posets, we drop reflexivity and state the facts
  about antisymmetric and transitive relations.}}
