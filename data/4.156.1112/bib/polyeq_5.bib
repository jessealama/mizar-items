  SUMMARY = {In this article, the principal $n$ th root of a
  complex number is defined and the Vieta's formulas for polynomial equations
  of degree 2,3 and 4 are formalized. The solution of quadratic equations,
  the Cardan's solution of cubic equations and the Descartes-Euler solution of
  quartic equations in terms of their complex coefficients
  are also presented\cite{Korn}.}
