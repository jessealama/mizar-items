  SUMMARY = {The aim of this paper is to formalize the second part of
   Chapter I Section 1 (1.9--1.19) in \cite{CCL}. Definitions of Scott's auxiliary and
   approximating relations are introduced in this work. We showed
   that in a meet-continuous lattice, the way-below relation is the
   intersection of all approximating auxiliary relations (proposition (40)
   --- compare 1.13 in \cite[pp.~43--47]{CCL}). By (41) a continuous lattice is a complete
   lattice in which $\ll$ is the smallest approximating auxiliary relation.
   The notions of the strong interpolation property and the interpolation
   property are also introduced.}}
