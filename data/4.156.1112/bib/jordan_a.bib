  SUMMARY = {The main goal of the work was to introduce the concept of the segmentation of
a simple closed curve into (arbitrary small) arcs. The existence of it
has been proved
by Yatsuka Nakamura \cite{JORDAN7.ABS}. The concept of the gap of a segmentation
is also introduced. It is the smallest distance between disjoint segments
in the segmentation.
For this purpose, the relationship between segments of an arc
 \cite{JORDAN6.ABS} and segments on a simple
closed curve \cite{JORDAN7.ABS} has been shown.}}
