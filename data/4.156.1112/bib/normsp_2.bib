  SUMMARY = {As application of complete metric space, we proved
  a Baire's category theorem. Then we defined some spaces generated
  from real normed space and discussed each of them. In the second
  section, we showed the equivalence of convergence and the continuity
  of a function. In other sections, we showed some topological
  properties of two spaces, which are topological
  space and linear topological space generated from real normed space.}}
