  SUMMARY = {  In the monography \cite{SZMIELEW:1}
W. Szmielew introduced the parallelity planes $\langle S$; $\parallel \rangle$,
where $\parallel \subseteq S\times S\times S\times S$.
In this text we omit upper bound axiom which must be
satisfied by the parallelity planes (see also E.Kusak \cite{KUSAK:1}).
Further we will list those theorems which remain true when we pass from
the parallelity planes to the parallelity spaces.
  We construct a model of the parallelity space in Abelian group
 $\langle F\times F\times F; +_F, -_F, {\bf 0}_F \rangle$,
where $F$ is a field. }}
