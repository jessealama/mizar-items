  SUMMARY = {This article is devoted to functions of general topological spaces.
 A function from $X$ to $Y$ is $A$-continuous if the counterimage 
 of every open
 set $V$ of $Y$ belongs to $A$, where $A$ is a collection of subsets of $X$.
 We give
 the following characteristics of the continuity, called decomposition
 of continuity: A function $f$ is continuous if and only if it is both
 $A$-continuous and $B$-continuous.}}
