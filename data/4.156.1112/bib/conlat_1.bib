  SUMMARY = {In this paper we give Mizar formalization of concept lattices. Concept
lattices stem from the so-called formal concept analysis --- a part of
applied mathematics that brings mathematical methods into the field of
data analysis and knowledge processing. Our approach follows the one given
in \cite{GanterWille}.}}
