  SUMMARY = {A continuation of \cite{CONAFFM.ABS}.
We introduce more configurational
axioms i.e. orthogonalizations of ``scherungssatzes" (direct and indirect),
``Scherungssatz" with orthogonal axes, Pappus axiom with orthogonal axes;
we also consider the affine Major Pappus Axiom and affine minor Desargues
Axiom. We prove a number of implications which hold between the above axioms.}}
