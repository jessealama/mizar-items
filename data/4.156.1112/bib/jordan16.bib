  SUMMARY = {The purpose of the paper is to prove lemmas needed for
the Jordan curve theorem. The main result is that the decomposition of
a simple closed curve into two arcs with the ends $p_1, p_2$ is unique
in the sense that every arc on the curve with the same ends must be equal
to one of them.}}
