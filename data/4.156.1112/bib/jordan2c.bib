  SUMMARY = {First, notions of inside components and outside components are
introduced for any subset of $n$-dimensional Euclid space.
  Next, notions of the bounded domain and the unbounded domain are
defined using the above components.  If the dimension is larger than 1,
and if a subset is bounded, a unbounded domain of the subset coincides with
an outside component (which is unique) of the subset.
  For a sphere in $n$-dimensional space, the similar fact is true
for a bounded domain.
  In 2 dimensional space, any rectangle also has such property.
  We discussed relations between the Jordan property and the concept of boundary,
which are necessary to find points in domains near a curve.
  In the last part, we gave the sufficient criterion for belonging
to the left component of some clockwise oriented finite sequences.}}
