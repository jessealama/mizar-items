  SUMMARY = {In the paper the ``way-below" relation, in symbols $x \ll y$, is introduced.
Some authors prefer the term ``relatively compact" or ``way inside", since
in the poset of open sets of a topology it is natural to read $U \ll V$ as
``$U$ is relatively compact in $V$".
A compact element of a poset (or an element isolated from below) is defined
to be way below itself. So, the compactness in the poset of open sets 
of a topology 
is equivalent to the compactness in that topology.\par
The article includes definitions, facts and examples 1.1--1.8
presented in \cite[pp.~38--42]{CCL}.}}
