  SUMMARY = {The classical sequence of implications which
hold between Desargues and Pappus Axioms is proved. Formally Minor
and Major Desargues Axiom (as suitable properties -- predicates -- of
an affine plane) together with all its indirect forms are introduced;
the same procedure
is applied to Pappus Axioms. The so called Trapezium
Desargues Axiom is also considered.}}
