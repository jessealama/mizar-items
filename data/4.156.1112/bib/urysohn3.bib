  SUMMARY = {This article is the third part of a paper proving
    the fundamental Urysohn Theorem concerning the
    existence of a real valued continuous function on
   a normal topological space.
      The paper is divided into two parts. In the first
    part, we describe the construction of the function
    solving thesis of the Urysohn Lemma. The second part
    contains the proof of the Urysohn Lemma in normal
    space and the proof of the same theorem for compact space.}}
