  SUMMARY = {The notions of arc and line segment are introduced in two-dimensional
topological real space ${\cal E}^2_{\rm T}$.
 Some basic theorems for these notions are proved.
Using line segments, the notion of special polygonal arc
is defined.  It has been shown that any special polygonal arc is homeomorphic
to unit interval ${\Bbb I}$. The notion of unit square 
 $\square_{\cal E^{2}_{\rm T}}$ has been also introduced and some facts 
about it have been proved.}}
