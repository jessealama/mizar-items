  SUMMARY = {A pseudorandom number generator
  plays an important role in computer science practice,
  for example in computer simulations, cryptology, and so on.
  A pseudorandom number generator is an algorithm that generates
  a sequence of numbers that is indistinguishable from
  the true random number sequence.
  In this article, we formalize the "Uniform Distribution" that is the
  idealized set of true random number sequences.
  The basic ideas of our formalization comes from \cite{CINTA}.}}
