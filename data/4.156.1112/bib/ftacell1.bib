  SUMMARY = {To evaluate our formal verification method on a real-size
  calculation circuit, in this article, we continue to formalize the concept
  of the 4-2 Binary Addition Cell primitives (FTAs), to define the structures
  of calculation units for a very fast multiplication algorithm for VLSI
  implementation \cite{Vuillemin1983}. We define the circuit structure of
  four-types FTAs, TYPE-0 to TYPE-3, using the series constructions of the
  Generalized Full Adder Circuits (GFAs) that generalized adder to have for
  each positive and negative weights to inputs and outputs \cite{GFACIRC1}.
  We then successfully prove its circuit stability of the calculation outputs
  after four-steps. The motivation for this research is to establish a technique
  based on formalized mathematics and its applications for calculation circuits
  with high reliability.}}
