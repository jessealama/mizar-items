  SUMMARY = {The article presents well known facts about eigenvalues of
       linear transformation of a vector space (see \cite{HerstenWinter}).
       We formalize main dependencies between eigenvalues and the
       diagram of the matrix of a linear transformation
       over a finite-dimensional
       vector space. Finally, we formalize the subspace
       $\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=0}^\infty {\rm Ker}(f-\lambda I)^i$
       called a generalized eigenspace for the eigenvalue $\lambda$ and show
       its basic properties.}}
