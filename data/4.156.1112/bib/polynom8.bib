  SUMMARY = {In this article we define the Discrete Fourier Transformation 
  for univariate polynomials and show that multiplication of 
  polynomials can be carried out by two Fourier Transformations 
  with a vector multiplication in-between. Our proof follows the 
  standard one found in the literature and uses Vandermonde matrices, 
  see e.g. \cite{ModernComputerAlgebra}.}}
