  SUMMARY = {Introduces a definition of a subalgebra of a universal algebra. A notion
of similar algebras and basic operations on subalgebras such as a subalgebra
generated by a set, the intersection and the sum of two subalgebras were 
introduced. Some basic facts concerning the above notions have been proved.
The article also contains the definition of a lattice of subalgebras of
a universal algebra.}}
