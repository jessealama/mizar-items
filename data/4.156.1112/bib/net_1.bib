  SUMMARY = {Some fundamental notions of the theory of Petri nets
are described in Mizar formalism. A Petri net is defined as a
triple of the form $\langle
 {\rm places},\,{\rm transitions},\,{\rm flow} \rangle$
with places and transitions
being disjoint sets and flow being a relation included in
 ${\rm places} \times {\rm transitions}$.}}
