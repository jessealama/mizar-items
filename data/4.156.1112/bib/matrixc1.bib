  SUMMARY = {Concepts of the inner product and conjugate of matrix
      of complex numbers are defined here. Operations such as addition,
      subtraction, scalar multiplication and inner product are introduced
      using correspondent definitions of the conjugate of a matrix
      of a complex field. Many equations for such operations consist
      like a case of the conjugate of matrix of a field and some operations
      on the set of sum of complex numbers are introduced.}}
