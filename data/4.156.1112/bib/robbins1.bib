  SUMMARY = {In the early 1930s, Huntington proposed several axiom
 systems for Boolean algebras. Robbins slightly changed
 one of them and asked if the resulted system is still
 a basis for variety of Boolean algebras. The solution
 (afirmative answer) was given in 1996 by McCune with
 the help of automated theorem prover EQP/{\sc Otter}.
 Some simplified and restucturized versions of this proof
 are known.
 In our version of proof that all Robbins algebras
 are Boolean we use the results of McCune \cite{McCuneRob},
 Huntington \cite{Huntington1}, \cite{Huntington2}, \cite{Huntington3}
 and Dahn \cite{DahnRob}.}}
