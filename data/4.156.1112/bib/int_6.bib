  SUMMARY = {In this article we show the correctness of integer
      arithmetic based on Chinese Remainder theorem as described
      e.g. in \cite{Gathen:1999}: Integers are transformed to
      finite sequences of modular integers, on which the arithmetic
      operations are performed. Retransformation of the results to
      the integers is then accomplished by means of the Chinese
      Remainder theorem. The method presented is a typical example
      for computing in homomorphic images.}}
