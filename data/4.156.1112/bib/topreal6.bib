  SUMMARY = {This paper contains theorems which describe the correspondence
between topological properties of real numbers subsets introduced
in \cite{RCOMP_1.ABS} and introduced in \cite{PRE_TOPC.ABS},
 \cite{COMPTS_1.ABS}. We also show the homeomorphism 
 between the cartesian product of two $R^1$ and ${\cal E}^2_{\rm T}$. 
 The compactness of the bounded closed subset of
 ${\cal E}^2_{\rm T}$ is proven.}}
