  SUMMARY = {We present elementary versions of Pappus, Major Desargues
and Minor Desargues Axioms (i.e. statements formulated entirely in the
language of points and parallelity of segments). Evidently they are 
consequences of appropriate configurational axioms introduced in the 
article \cite{AFF_2.ABS}.
In particular it follows that there exists an affine
plane satisfying all of them.}}
