  SUMMARY = {A brief survey on semi-affine geometry, which results
from the classical Pappian and Desarguesian affine (dimension free) 
geometry by weakening the so called trapezium axiom. With the help of the
relation of parallelogram in every semi-affine space we define the 
operation of ``addition" of ``vectors". Next we investigate in greater
details the relation of (affine) trapezium in such spaces.}}
