  SUMMARY = {Two kinds of sorting operators,
   descendent one and ascendent one
  are introduced for finite sequences of reals. They are also called
  rearrangement of finite sequences of reals.  Maximum and minimum values
  of finite sequences of reals are also defined.
  We also discuss relations between these concepts.}}
