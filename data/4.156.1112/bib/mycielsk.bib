  SUMMARY = {Let $\omega(G)$ and $\chi(G)$ be the clique number and the chromatic
  number of a graph $G$. Mycielski~\cite{Mycielski55} presented a
  construction that for any $n$ creates a graph $M_n$  which is triangle-free
  ($\omega(G) = 2$) with $\chi(G) > n$.  The starting point is the complete
  graph of two vertices ($K_2$).  $M_(n+1)$ is obtained from $M_n$
  through the operation $\mu(G)$ called the Mycielskian of a graph $G$.
  \par
  We first define the operation $\mu(G)$ and then show that
  $\omega(\mu(G)) = \omega(G)$ and $\chi(\mu(G)) = \chi(G)+1$.  This is
  done for arbitrary graph $G$, see also~\cite{LUP95}.  Then we
  define the sequence of graphs $M_n$ each of exponential size in $n$
  and give their clique and chromatic numbers.}}
