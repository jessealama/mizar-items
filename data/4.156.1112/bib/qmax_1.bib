  SUMMARY = {In this article we present the logical structure given by four
axioms of Mackey \cite{MACKEY} in the set of propositions of Quantum
Mechanics.
The equivalence relation (PropRel(Q)) in the set of propositions (Prop Q)
for given Quantum Mechanics Q is considered.
The main text for this article is \cite{EQREL_1.ABS}
where the structure
of quotient space and the properties of equivalence relations, classes and
partitions are studied.}}
