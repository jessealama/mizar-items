the codomain, and the field of relation;
the empty and the identity relations, the composition of relations,
the image and the inverse image of a set under a relation.
Two predicates, = and $\subseteq$, and three functions,
 $\cup$, $\cap$ and $\setminus$ are redefined.
Basic facts about the above mentioned notions are presented.}}
