  SUMMARY = {In this article at first, we proved the lemma of
         the inferior limit and the superior limit.
         Next, we proved the Baire category theorem (Banach space version)
         \cite{yoshida:1980}, \cite{miyadera:1972}, \cite{Dunford:1958},
         quoted them and proved the uniform boundedness principle.
         Moreover, it added the proof of the Banach-Steinhaus theorem.}}
