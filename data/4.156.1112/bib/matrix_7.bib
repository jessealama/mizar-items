  SUMMARY = {Here, we present determinants of some square matrices of
  field elements. First, the determinat of $2*2$ matrix is shown.
  Secondly, the determinants of zero matrix and unit matrix are shown,
  which are equal to 0 in the field and 1 in the field respectively.
  Thirdly, the determinant of diagonal matrix is shown, which is a product
  of all diagonal elements of the matrix. At the end, we prove that the
  determinant of a matrix is the same as the determinant of its transpose.}}
