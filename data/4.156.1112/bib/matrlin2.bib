  SUMMARY = {The paper is concerned with a generalization of concepts introduced
       in \cite{MATRLIN.ABS}, i.e. there are introduced matrices of linear
       transformations over a finite-dimensional vector space.
       We introduce linear transformations over a finite-dimensional vector
       space depending on a given matrix of the transformation.
       At the end, we prove that the rank of linear transformations over
       a finite-dimensional vector space is the same as the rank of the matrix
       of that transformation.}}
