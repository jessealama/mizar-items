  SUMMARY = {This article is a continuation of an article on defining
functions on trees (see \cite{DTCONSTR.ABS}).
In this article we develop terminology specialized for binary trees,
first defining binary trees and binary grammars.
We recast the induction principle for the set of parse trees of binary 
grammars and the scheme of defining functions inductively with the set
as domain. We conclude with defining the scheme of defining such
functions by lambda-like expressions.}}
