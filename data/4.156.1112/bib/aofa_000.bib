  SUMMARY = {Algorithms and its parts -- instructions -- are introduced
  as elements of if-while algebras. An if-while algebra is a (1-sorted)
  universal algebra which has 4 operations:
   a constant -- the empty instruction,
   a binary catenation of instructions,
   a ternary conditional instruction, and
   a binary while instruction.
   An execution function is defined on pairs $(s,I)$, where $s$
   is a state (an element of certain set of states) and $I$ is
   an instruction, and results in states. The execution function
   obeys control structures using the set of distinguished
   true states. I.e., a condition instruction is executed and
   the continuation of execution depends on if the resulting state
   is in true states or not.
   Termination is also defined for pairs $(s,I)$ and depends
   on the execution function. The existence of execution function
   determined on elementary instructions and the uniqueness of
   it for terminating instructions are shown.}}
