  SUMMARY = {Some theorems about well ordering relations are proved. The goal
of the article is to prove that every two well
ordering relations are either isomorphic or one of them is isomorphic
to a segment of the other.
The following concepts are defined: the segment of a relation
induced by an element, well founded relations, well ordering
relations, the restriction of a relation to a set, and the isomorphism
of two relations.
A number of simple facts is presented.}}
