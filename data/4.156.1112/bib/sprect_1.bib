  SUMMARY = {The article deals with a rather technical concept -- rectangular sequences
of the points of the plane. We mean by that a finite sequence consisting
of five elements, that is circular, i.e. the first element and the fifth
one of it are equal, and such that the polygon determined by it is a non
degenerated rectangle, with sides parallel to axes.
The main result is that for the rectangle determined by such a sequence
the left and the right component of the complement of it are different and
disjoint.}}
