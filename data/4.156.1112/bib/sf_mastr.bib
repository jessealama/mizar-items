  SUMMARY = {   We introduce some terminology for reasoning about memory used in
   programs in general and in macro instructions
   (introduced in \cite{SCMFSA6A.ABS}) in particular.
   The usage of integer locations and of finite sequence locations
   by a program is treated separately.  We define some functors
   for selecting memory locations needed for local (temporary) variables
   in macro instructions.  Some semantic properties of the introduced
   notions are given in terms of executions of macro instructions.}}
