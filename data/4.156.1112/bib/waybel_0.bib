  SUMMARY = {Notation and facts necessary to start with
the formalization of continuous lattices according to \cite{CCL}
are introduced.
The article contains among other things, the definition
of directed and filtered subsets of a poset
(see 1.1 in \cite[p.~2]{CCL}),
the definition of nets on the poset
(see 1.2 in \cite[p.~2]{CCL}),
the definition of ideals and filters and
the definition of maps preserving arbitrary and directed sups and
arbitrary and filtered infs
(1.9 also in \cite[p.~4]{CCL}).
The concepts of semilattices, sup-semiletices and poset lattices
(1.8 in \cite[p.~4]{CCL})
are also introduced.
A number of facts concerning the above notion and including remarks 1.4, 
1.5, and
1.10 from \cite[pp.~3--5]{CCL}
is presented.}}
