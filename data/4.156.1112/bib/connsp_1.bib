  SUMMARY = { The following notions are defined: separated sets, connected spaces,
connected sets, components of a topological space,
the component of a point.
The definition of the boundary of a set is also included.
The singleton of a point of a topological space is redefined as a subset
of the space.
Some theorems about these notions are proved.}}
