  SUMMARY = {In this article we continue the investigations from \cite{CIRCCOMB.ABS} and
 \cite{FACIRC_1.ABS} of verification of a circuit design.
We concentrate on the combination of multi cell circuits from
given cells (circuit modules). Namely, we formalize a design of the
form  \\
 \input CIRCCMB2.PIC
and prove its stability. The formalization proposed consists in a series
of schemes which allow to define multi cells circuits and prove their
properties.
Our goal is to achive mathematical formalization which will allow to verify
designs of real circuits.}}
