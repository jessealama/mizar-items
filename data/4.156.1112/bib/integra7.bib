  SUMMARY = {In this article we define the Riemann indefinite integral of
  functions of real variable and prove the linearity of
  that \cite{Apostol:1969}.
  And we give some examples of the indefinite integral of some elementary
  functions. Furthermore, also the theorem about integral operation and
  uniform convergent sequence of functions is proved.}}
