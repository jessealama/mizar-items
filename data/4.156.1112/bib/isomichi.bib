  SUMMARY = {We formalized article ``New concepts in the theory of
    topological space -- supercondensed set, subcondensed set,
    and condensed set'' by Yoshinori Isomichi. First
    we defined supercondensed, subcondensed, and condensed sets
    and then gradually, defining other attributes such as regular
    open set or regular closed set, we formalized all the
    theorems and remarks that one can find in Isomichi's article.}}
