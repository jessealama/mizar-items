  SUMMARY = {Connections between Minor Desargues Axiom and
the transitivity of translation groups are investigated. 
A formal proof of the theorem
which establishes the equivalence of these two properties of affine 
planes is given. We also  prove that, under additional requirement,
the plane in question satisfies Fano Axiom; its translation group is
uniquely two-divisible.}}
