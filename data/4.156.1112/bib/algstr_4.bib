  SUMMARY = {This article introduces the free magma $M(X)$ constructed on a set $X$ \cite{BourbakiAlgI}.
  Then, we formalize some theorems about $M(X)$: if $f$ is a function from the set $X$ to a
  magma $N$, the free magma $M(X)$ has a unique extension of $f$ to a morphism of $M(X)$ into $N$
  and every magma is isomorphic to a magma generated by a set $X$ under a set of relators on $M(X)$.
  In doing it, the article defines the stable subset under the law of composition of a magma,
  the submagma, the equivalence relation compatible with the law of composition and the
  equivalence kernel of a function. We also introduce some schemes on recursive function.}}
