  SUMMARY = {     We construct a real normed space $\langle V,~\Vert.\Vert\rangle$,
where $V$ is a real vector space and $\Vert.\Vert$ is a norm. Auxillary
properties of the norm are proved. Next, we introduce a notion
of sequence in the real normed space. The basic operations on
sequences (addition, subtraction, multiplication by real
number) are defined. We study some properties of sequences in
the real normed space and the operations on them.}}
