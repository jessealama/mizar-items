  SUMMARY = {This is the first Mizar article in a series
  aiming at a complete formalization of the textbook
  ``General Topology''
  by Engelking \cite{ENGEL:1}.
  We cover the first part of Section 1.3, by defining
  such notions as a derivative of a subset $A$ of a topological
  space (usually denoted by $A^{\rm d}$, but ${\rm Der~} A$ in our notation),
  the derivative and the
  boundary of families of subsets, points of accumulation and isolated
  points. We also introduce dense-in-itself, perfect and scattered
  topological spaces and formulate the notion of the density of a space.
  Some basic properties are given as well as selected exercises
  from \cite{ENGEL:1}.}}
