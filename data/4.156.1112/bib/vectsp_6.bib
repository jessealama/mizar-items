  SUMMARY = {The notion of linear combination of vectors is introduced as a function
from the carrier of a vector space to the carrier of the field. Definition
of linear combination of set of vectors is also presented. We define
addition and subtraction of combinations and multiplication of combination
by element of the field. Sum of finite set of vectors and sum of
linear combination is defined. We prove theorems that belong rather
to \cite{VECTSP_1.ABS}.}}
