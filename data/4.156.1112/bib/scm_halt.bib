  SUMMARY = {Up to now, many properties of macro instructions of {\SCMFSA}
are described by the parahalting concepts. However, many practical
programs are not always halting while they are halting for
   initialization states. For this reason, we propose initialization
   halting concepts. That a program is initialization halting (called
   ``InitHalting'' for short) means it is halting for initialization
   states. In order to  make the halting proof of more complicated
   programs easy, we present ``InitHalting'' basic properties of
   the compositions of the macro instructions, if-Macro (conditional branch
   macro instructions) and Times-Macro (for-loop macro instructions) etc.}}
