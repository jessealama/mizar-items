  SUMMARY = {In this paper, we defined the congruence relation and proved its 
    fundamental properties on the base of some useful theorems. Then we proved 
    the existence of solution and the number of incongruent solution to a linear 
    congruence and the linear congruent equation class, in particular, we proved 
    the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
    Finally, we defined the complete residue system and proved its fundamental 
    properties.}}
