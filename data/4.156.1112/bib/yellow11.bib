  SUMMARY = {This article contains definitions of the ``pentagon'' lattice $N_5$
  and the ``diamond'' lattice $M_3$. It is followed by the characterization of
  modular and distributive lattices depending on the possible shape of substructures.
  The last part treats of interval-like sublattices of any lattice.}}
