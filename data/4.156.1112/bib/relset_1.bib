  SUMMARY = {    The article includes theorems concerning properties of
 relations defined as a subset of the Cartesian product of two sets
 (mode Relation of $X$,$Y$ where $X$,$Y$ are sets). Some notions,
 introduced in \cite{RELAT_1.ABS}
 such as domain, codomain, field of a relation,
 composition of relations, image and inverse image of a set under a relation
 are redefined.                }}
