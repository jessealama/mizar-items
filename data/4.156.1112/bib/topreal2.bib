  SUMMARY = {Continuation of \cite{TOPREAL1.ABS}.  The fact that
the unit square is compact is shown in the beginning of the article.  Next
the notion of simple closed curve is introduced. It is proved
that any simple closed curve can be divided into two independent parts
which are homeomorphic to unit interval ${\Bbb I}$.}}
