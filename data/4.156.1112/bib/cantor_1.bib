  SUMMARY = {The aim of the paper is to define some basic notions of the theory
of topological spaces like basis and prebasis, and to prove  their
simple properties. The definition of the Cantor set is given in terms
of countable product of $\{0,1\}$ and a collection of its subsets
to serve as a prebasis.}}
