  SUMMARY = {The aim of this paper is to develop a formal theory of Mizar types.
 The presented theory is an approach to the structure of Mizar types
 as a sup-semilattice with widening (subtyping) relation as the order.
 It is an abstraction from the existing implementation of
 the Mizar verifier and formalization of the ideas from 
  \cite{Bancerek:2003}. }}
