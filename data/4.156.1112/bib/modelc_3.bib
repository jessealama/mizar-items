  SUMMARY = {This text includes verification of the basic
  algorithm in Simple On-the-fly Automatic Verification of
  Linear Temporal Logic(LTL).
  LTL formula can be transformed to Buchi automaton,
  and this transforming algorithm is mainly used at
  Simple On-the-fly Automatic Verification.
  In this article, we verified this transforming algorithm itself.
  At first we prepared some definitions and operations
  for transforming.
  And then, we defined the Buchi automaton and verified transforming
  algorithm.}}
