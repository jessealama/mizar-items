  SUMMARY = {This is the continuation of the sequence of articles on trees
(see \cite{TREES_1.ABS}, \cite{TREES_2.ABS}, \cite{TREES_3.ABS}).
The main goal is to introduce joining operations
on decorated trees corresponding with operations
introduced in \cite{TREES_3.ABS}.
We will also introduce the operation of substitution.
In the last section we dealt with trees decorated by Cartesian
product, i.e. we showed some lemmas on joining operations applied to
such trees.}}
