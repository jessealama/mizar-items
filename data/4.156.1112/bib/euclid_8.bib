  SUMMARY = {In this article, we first extend several basic theorems of
          the operation of vector in 3-dimensional euclidean spaces. Then
          introduce three unit vectors: $e1$, $e2$, $e3$ and the definition
          of vector function in the same spaces. By dint of unit vector the
          main operation properties as well as the differentiation formulas
          of vector function are shown \cite{Spiegel:1959}.}}
