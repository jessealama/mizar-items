  SUMMARY = { We define the proper and the improper limit
of a real function at a point.
 The main properties of the operations on the limit
of function are proved. The connection between the one-side
limits and the limit of function at a point are exposed.
 Equivalent Cauchy and Heine characterizations of the limit
of real function at a point are proved.}}
