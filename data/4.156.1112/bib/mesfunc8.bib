  SUMMARY = {The goal of this article is to prove Egoroff's
  Theorem \cite{Halmos74}.
  However, there are not enough theorems related to sequence of
  measurable functions in current library. So we proved
  many theorems about them. At the end of this article,
  we showed Egoroff's theorem.}}
