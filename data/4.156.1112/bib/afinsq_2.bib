  SUMMARY = {Here, we develop the theory of zero based finite sequences,
  which are, sometimes, more useful in applications than normal one based
  finite sequences.
  The fundamental function Sgm is introduced as well as in case of
  normal finite sequences and other notions are also introduced.
  However many theorems are modification of old theorems of normal
  finite sequences, they are basically important and are necessary
  for applications.
  A new concept of selected subsequence is introduced. This concept
  came from the individual Ergodic theorem (\cite{Halmos:1956}) and it is
  the preparation for its proof.}}
