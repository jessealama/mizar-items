  SUMMARY = {In the classes of projective spaces, defined in terms of collinearity,
introduced in the article \cite{ANPROJ_2.ABS}, we distinguish the
subclasses of Pappian projective structures. As examples of these
objects we consider analytical projective spaces defined over
suitable real linear spaces; analytical counterpart of the Pappus
Axiom is proved without any assumption on the dimension of the underlying
linear space.}}
