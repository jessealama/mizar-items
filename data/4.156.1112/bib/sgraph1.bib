  SUMMARY = {A graph is simple when
 \begin{itemize}
  \parskip -1mm
  \item it is non-directed,
  \item there is at most one edge between two vertices,
  \item there is no loop of length one.
 \end{itemize}
A formalization of simple graphs is given from scratch.
There is already an article \cite{GRAPH_1.ABS}, dealing with the similar
subject.
It is not used as a starting-point, because
 \cite{GRAPH_1.ABS} formalizes directed non-empty graphs.
Given a set of vertices, edge is defined as an (unordered) pair of 
different two vertices and graph as a pair of a set of vertices and 
a set of edges.\par
The following concepts are introduced:
 \begin{itemize}
   \parskip -1mm
  \item simple graph structure,
  \item the set of all simple graphs,
  \item equality relation on graphs.
  \item the notion of degrees of vertices;
      the number of edges connected to, or the number of adjacent vertices,
  \item the notion of subgraphs,
  \item path, cycle,
  \item complete and bipartite complete graphs,
 \end{itemize}\par
Theorems proved in this articles include:
 \begin{itemize}
  \parskip -1mm
 \item the set of simple graphs satisfies a certain minimality condition,
  \item equivalence between two notions of degrees.
 \end{itemize}}}
