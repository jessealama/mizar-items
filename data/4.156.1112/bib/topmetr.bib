  SUMMARY = { Some notions connected with metric spaces and
    the relationship between metric spaces and topological spaces.
    Compactness of topological spaces is transferred for the case of
    metric spaces \cite{KELL55}.  Some basic theorems about translations of 
topological
    notions for metric spaces are proved. One-dimensional topological 
    space ${\Bbb R^1}$ is introduced, too.}}
