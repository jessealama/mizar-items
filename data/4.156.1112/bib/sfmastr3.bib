  SUMMARY = {We define a {\tt for} type (going up) macro instruction in terms of
the {\tt while} macro.  This gives an iterative macro with an explicit
control variable.
The {\tt for} macro is used to define a macro for the selection sort
acting on a finite sequence location of {\SCMFSA}.
On the way, a macro for finding a minimum in a section of an array
is defined.}}
