  SUMMARY = {In this article, magnitude relation properties of Radix-$2^k$ SD number
  are discussed.
  Until now, the Radix-$2^k$ SD Number has been proposed for the high-speed
  calculations for RSA Cryptograms. In RSA Cryptograms, many modulo calculations
  are used, and modulo calculations need a comparison between two numbers.\par
  In this article, we discuss magnitude relation of Radix-$2^k$
  SD Number. In the first section, we present some useful theorems for
  operations of Radix-$2^k$ SD Number. In the second section, we prove some
  properties of the primary numbers expressed by Radix-$2^k$ SD Number
  such as 0, 1, and Radix(k). In the third section, we prove primary
  magnitude relations between two Radix-$2^k$ SD Numbers. In the fourth
  section, we define Max/Min numbers in some cases. And in the last section,
  we prove some relations between the addition of Max/Min numbers.}}
