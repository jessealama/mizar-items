  SUMMARY = {A finite partial state is said to be autonomic if
  the computation results in any two states containing it are same
  on its domain. On the basis of this definition, this article presents
  some computation results about autonomic finite partial states of the
  SCMPDS computer. Because the instructions of the SCMPDS computer are
  more complicated than those of the SCMFSA computer, the results given
  by this article are weaker than those reported previously by the article
  on the SCMFSA computer. The second task of this article is to define
  the notion of program shift. The importance of this notion is that
  the computation of some program blocks can be simplified by shifting
  a program block to the initial position.}}
