  SUMMARY = {In RSA Cryptograms, many modulo calculations are used, but modulo calculation is
 based on many subtractions and it takes long a time to calculate it. In this article,
 we explain a new modulo calculation algorithm using a table. And we prove
 that upper 3 digits of Radix-$2^k$ SD numbers are enough to specify the answer.
  \par
 In the first section, we present some useful theorems for operations of
 Radix-$2^k$ SD Number. In the second section, we define Upper 3 Digits of
 Radix-$2^k$ SD number and prove that property. In the third section, we prove
 some property connected with the minimum digits of Radix-$2^k$ SD number. In the fourth
 section, we identify the range of modulo arithmetic result and prove that the
 Upper 3 Digits indicate two possible answers. And in the last section, we define
 a function to select true answer from the results of Upper 3 Digits.}}
