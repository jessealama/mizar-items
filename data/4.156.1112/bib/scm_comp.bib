  SUMMARY = {We define a set of binary arithmetic expressions with the following
operations: $+$, $-$, $\cdot$, {\tt mod}, and {\tt div} and formalize the
common meaning of the expressions in the set of integers.
Then, we define a compile function that for a given expression
results in a program for the {\bf SCM} machine defined by Nakamura 
and Trybulec in \cite{AMI_1.ABS}. We prove that the generated program
when loaded into the machine and executed computes the value of
the expression. The program uses additional memory and runs
in time linear in length of the expression.}}
