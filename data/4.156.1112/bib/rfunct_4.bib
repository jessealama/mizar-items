  SUMMARY = {This article is an introduction to convex analysis. In the beginning, we have
defined the concept of strictly convexity and proved some basic properties
between convexity and strictly convexity. Moreover, we have defined concepts
of other convexity and semicontinuity, and proved their basic properties.}}
