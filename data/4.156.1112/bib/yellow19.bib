  SUMMARY = {In the paper we show equivalence of the convergence of filters
 on a topological space and the convergence of nets in the space.
 We also give, five characterizations of compactness. Namely,
 for any topological space $T$ we proved that following condition
 are equivalent:
 \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep-3pt
 \item $T$ is compact,
 \item every ultrafilter on $T$ is convergent,
 \item every proper filter on $T$ has cluster point,
 \item every net in $T$ has cluster point,
 \item every net in $T$ has convergent subnet,
 \item every Cauchy net in $T$ is convergent.
 \end{itemize}}}
