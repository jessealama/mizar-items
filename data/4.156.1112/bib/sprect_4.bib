  SUMMARY = {By the special polygonal curve we meana simple closed curve, that
is a polygone and moreover has edges parallel to axes. We continue
the formalization of the Takeuti-Nakamura proof \cite{TAKE-NAKA}
of the Jordan curve theorem.
In the paper we prove that the complement of the special polygonal
curve consists of at least two components. With the theorem which
has at most two components we completed the theorem that a special
polygonal curve cuts the plane into exactly two components.}}
