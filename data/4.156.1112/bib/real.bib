  SUMMARY = {This file contains statements which are obvious for Mizar checker if
 "requirements REAL" is included in the environment description
 of an article. "requirements NUMERALS" is also required.
 They are published for testing purposes only.
 Users should use appropriate requirements instead of referencing
 to these theorems.
 Statements which cannot be expressed in Mizar language are commented out.
 Some of these items need also other requirements for proper work.}}
