  SUMMARY = {We continue the formalization of Groebner bases following the book
         ``Groebner Bases -- A Computational Approach to Commutative
         Algebra'' by Becker and Weispfenning.
         Here we prove Buchberger's first criterium on avoiding S-polynomials:
         S-polynomials for polynomials with disjoint head terms need not be
         considered when constructing Groebner bases.
         In the course of formalizing this theorem we also introduced the
         splitting of a polynomial in an upper and a lower polynomial containing
         the greater resp. smaller terms of the original polynomial with respect
         to a given term order.}}
