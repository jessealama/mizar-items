  SUMMARY = {An attempt to use the {\tt while} macro, \cite{SCMFSA_9.ABS},
was the origin of writing this article.
The {\tt while} semantics, as given by J.-C.~Chen, is slightly extended by
weakening its correctness conditions and this forced a quite straightforward
remake of a number of theorems from \cite{SCMFSA_9.ABS}.
Numerous additional properties of the {\tt while} macro are then proven.
In the last section, we define a macro instruction computing the
{\tt fusc} function
(see the SCM program computing the same function in \cite{FIB_FUSC.ABS})
and prove its correctness.}}
