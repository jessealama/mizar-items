  SUMMARY = {The goal of this article is to formalize
  two versions of Ramsey's theorem. The theorems are not
  phrased in the usually pictorial representation of a coloured graph,
  but it is used a set-theoretic terminology. After some useful lemma, 
  the second section presents a generalization of Ramsey's theorem
  on infinite set closely following the book \cite{ThomasJech2002}.
  The last section includes the formalization of the theorem in a
  more known version (see \cite{PFTB}).}
