  SUMMARY = {This article includes proofs of several facts
  that are supplemental to the theorems proved in \cite{FLANG_1.ABS}.
  Next, it builds upon that theory to extend the framework
  for proving facts about formal languages in general
  and regular expression operators in particular.
  In this article, two quantifiers are defined and their properties are shown:
  m to n occurrences (or the union of a range of powers)
  and optional occurrence. Although optional occurrence
  is a special case of the previous operator (0 to 1 occurrences),
  it is often defined in regex applications as a separate
  operator -- hence its explicit definition and properties in the article.
  Notation and terminology were taken
  from \cite{WALL-CHRISTIANSEN-ORWANT:2000}.}}
