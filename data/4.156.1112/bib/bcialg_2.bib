  SUMMARY = {We have formalized the BCI-algebras closely following the
  book \cite{BCIAlgebras2}, P16-P19 and P58-65.
  In this article the properties of the element are firstly talked about,
  and then the definition and properties of congruences and quotient
  algebras are given. And the quotient algebras are a basic tool
  for exploring the structures of {BCI}-algebras.}}
