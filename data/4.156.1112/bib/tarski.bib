  SUMMARY = {This is the first part of the axiomatics of the Mizar system. It includes
the axioms of the Tarski Grothendieck set theory. They are:
 the axiom stating that everything is a set,
 the extensionality axiom,
 the definitional axiom of the singleton,
 the definitional axiom of the pair,
 the definitional axiom of the union of a family of sets,
 the definitional axiom of the boolean (the power set) of a set,
 the regularity axiom,
 the definitional axiom of the ordered pair,
 the Tarski's axiom~A introduced in \cite{TARSKI:1} (see also \cite{TARSKI:2}),
 and the Fr\ae nkel scheme.
Also, the definition of equinumerosity is introduced.}}
