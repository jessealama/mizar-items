  SUMMARY = {This article defines two while-loop statements on SCMPDS, i.e.
  ``while$<$0'' and ``while$>$0'', which resemble the while-statements of
  the common high language such as C. We previously presented a
  number of tricks for computing while-loop statements on SCMFSA,
  e.g. step-while. However, after inspecting a few realistic examples,
  we found that they are neither very useful nor of generalization.
  To cover much more computation cases of while-loop statements,
  we generalize the computation model of while-loop statements,
  based on the principle of Hoare's axioms on the verification of
  programs.}}
