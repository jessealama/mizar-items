  SUMMARY = {A Pythagorean triple is a set of positive integers
  $\{ a,b,c \}$ with $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
  We prove that every Pythagorean triple is of the form
  $$a = n^2 - m^2 \qquad b = 2mn \qquad c = n^2 + m^2$$
  or is a multiple of such a triple.
  Using this characterization we show that for every $n > 2$ there exists
  a Pythagorean triple $X$ with $n\in X$.
  Also we show that even the set of {\em simplified\/} Pythagorean triples
  is infinite.}}
