  SUMMARY = {   In this article we introduce a notion of real linear space,
operations on vectors: addition, multiplication by real number, 
inverse vector, subtraction.
  The sum of finite sequence of the vectors is also defined.
  Theorems that belong rather to \cite{NAT_1.ABS} or \cite{FINSEQ_1.ABS}
 are proved.}}
