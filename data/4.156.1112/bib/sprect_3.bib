  SUMMARY = {In the paper some auxiliary theorems are proved, needed in
  the proof of the second part of the Jordan curve theorem for special polygons.
   They deal mostly with characteristic points of plane non empty compacts
   introduced in \cite{PSCOMP_1.ABS}, operation {\em mid} introduced
   in \cite{JORDAN3.ABS} and the predicate ``$f$ is in the area of $g$''
   ($f$ and $g$ : finite sequences of points of the plane) introduced
   in \cite{SPRECT_2.ABS}.}}
