  SUMMARY = {We introduce the notion of a permanent \cite{Minc78}
  of a square matrix. It is a notion somewhat related to a determinant,
  so we follow closely the approach and theorems already introduced
  in the Mizar Mathematical Library for the determinant.
  Unfortunately, the formalization of the latter notion is at
  its early stage, so we had to prove many very elementary
  auxiliary facts.}}
