  SUMMARY = {The main goal of the article is the presentation of the theory of bilinear functionals
  in vector spaces. It introduces standard operations on bilinear functionals and proves
  their
  classical properties. It is shown that quotient functionals are non degenerated
  on the left and the right. In the case of symmetric and alternating bilinear functionals
  it is shown that the left and right kernels are equal.}}
