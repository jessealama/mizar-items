  SUMMARY = {   The article contains exactly the same definitions of group and field
as those in \cite{DIEUDONNE}.
  These definitions were prepared without the help of the
definitions and properties of {\it Nat} and {\it Real} modes included
in the MML.
  This is the first of a series of articles in which we are going to
introduce the concept of the set of real numbers in a elementary
axiomatic way.}}
