  SUMMARY = {A lattice is defined as an algebra on a nonempty set with binary operations
join and meet which are commutative and associative,  and  satisfy
the absorption identities.
The following kinds of lattices are considered:
distributive,
       modular,
       bounded (with zero and unit elements),
       complemented, 
   and  Boolean (with complement).
The article includes also theorems which immediately follow from definitions.}}
