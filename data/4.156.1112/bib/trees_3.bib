  SUMMARY = {In the article we deal with sets of trees and functions yielding trees.
So, we introduce the sets of all trees, all finite trees and
of all trees decorated by elements from some set. Next, the functions
and the finite sequences yielding (finite, decorated) trees are
introduced. There are shown some convenient but technical lemmas
and clusters concerning with those concepts. In the fourth section
we deal with trees decorated by Cartesian product and we introduce
the concept of a tree called a substitution of structure of some
finite tree. Finally, we introduce the operations of joining trees,
i.e. for the finite sequence of trees we define the tree which
is made by joining the trees from the sequence by common root.
For one and two trees there are introduced the same operations.}}
