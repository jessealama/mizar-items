  SUMMARY = {In this paper we present the Jordan Matrix Decomposition Theorem
     which states that an arbitrary square matrix $M$ over an algebraically
     closed field can be decomposed into the form $$M=SJS^{-1}$$
     where $S$ is an invertible matrix and $J$ is a matrix in a Jordan canonical
     form, i.e. a special type of block diagonal matrix in which each block
     consists of Jordan blocks (see \cite{GolubWilkinson}).}}
