  SUMMARY = {We continue Mizar formalization of General Topology according to
the book \cite{ENGEL:1} by Engelking. In the article
the formalization of Section 1.1 is completed.
Namely, the paper includes the formalization of theorems
on correspondence of the basis and basis in a point,
definitions of the character of a point and a topological space,
a neighborhood system, and the weight of a topological space.
The formalization is tested with almost discrete topological spaces
with infinity.}}
