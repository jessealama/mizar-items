  SUMMARY = {In two articles (this one and \cite{FIB_FUSC.ABS}) we discuss correctness
of two short programs for the {\bf SCM} machine:
one computes Fibonacci numbers
and the other computes the {\em fusc}
function of Dijkstra \cite{DIJKSTRA}.
The limitations of current Mizar implementation rendered it impossible
to present the correctness proofs for the programs in one article.
This part is purely technical and contains a number of very specific
lemmas about integer division, floor, exponentiation and logarithms.
The formal definitions of the Fibonacci sequence and the {\em fusc}
function may be of general interest.}}
