  SUMMARY = {This article formalizes proofs of some
  elementary theorems of number theory
  (see \cite{LeVeque, PFTB, }): Wilson's theorem
  (that $n$ is prime iff $n > 1$ and $(n-1)! \cong -1 (mod n)$),
  that all primes (1 mod 4) equal the sum of two squares, and two
  basic theorems of Euclid and Euler about perfect numbers.
  The article also formally defines Euler's sum of divisors
  function $\phi$, proves that $\phi$ is multiplicative
  and that $\Sum_{k|n} \phi (k) = n$.}}
