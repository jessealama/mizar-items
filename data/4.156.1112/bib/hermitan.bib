  SUMMARY = {In the article we present antilinear functionals, sesquilinear
and hermitan forms. We prove Schwarz and Minkowski inequalities,
and Parallelogram Law for non negative hermitan form.
The proof of Schwarz inequality is based on
   \cite{RUDIN:2}.
The incorrect proof of this fact can be found in \cite{Maurin}.
The construction of scalar product in quotient vector space from
non negative hermitan functions is the main result of the article.}}
