  SUMMARY = {  This article is a continuation of \cite{MIDSP_1.ABS}.
We have established a one-to-one correspondence between midpoint
algebras and groups with the operator 1/2. In general we shall say
that a given midpoint algebra $M$ and a group $V$ are $w$-assotiated iff $w$ is
an atlas from $M$ to $V$.
 At the beginning of the paper a few facts which rather belong to
 \cite{VECTSP_1.ABS}, \cite{MOD_1.MIZ} are proved.}}
