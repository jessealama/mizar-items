  SUMMARY = {This article introduces the fuzzy theory. At first, the definition of 
       fuzzy set characterized by membership function is described.
       Next, definitions of empty fuzzy set and universal fuzzy set and
       basic operations of these fuzzy sets are shown. At last, exclusive
       sum and absolute difference which are special operation are
       introduced.}}
