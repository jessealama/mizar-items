  SUMMARY = {In this article, we defined {\em sinus} and {\em cosine} as the real part 
and the imaginary part
of the exponential function on complex, and also give their series expression.
Then we proved the differentiablity of {\em sinus}, {\em cosine} 
and the exponential function
of real. Finally, we showed the existence of the circle ratio, and some formulas
 of {\em sinus}, {\em cosine}.}}
