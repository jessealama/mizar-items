  SUMMARY = {In this paper, we introduce basic properties
  of lines in the plane on this space. Lines and planes are expressed
  by the vector equation and are the image of $R$ and $R^2.$
  By this, we can say that the properties of the classic Euclid geometry
  are satisfied also in $R^n$ as we know them intuitively.
  Next, we define the metric between the point and the line of this space.}}
