  SUMMARY = {Quite a number of lemmas for the Jordan curve theorem, as yet
in the case of the special polygonal curves, have been proved.
By ``special" we mean, that it is a polygonal curve with edges
parallel to axes
and actually the lemmas have been proved, mostly, for the triangulations
i.e. for finite sequences that define the curve.
Moreover some of the results deal only with a special case:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item[-] finite sequences are clockwise oriented,
 \item[-] the first member of the sequence is the member with the lowest
   ordinate among those with the highest abscissa (N-min $f,$
   where $f$ is a finite sequence, in the Mizar jargon).
 \end{itemize}
In the change of the orientation one has to reverse the sequence
(the operation introduced in \cite{FINSEQ_5.ABS}) and to change
the second restriction one has to rotate the sequence (the operation
introduced in \cite{FINSEQ_6.ABS}).
The goal of the paper is to prove, mostly simple, facts about
the relationship between properties and attributes of the finite sequence
and its rotation (similar results about reversing had been proved in
   \cite{FINSEQ_5.ABS}). Some of them deal with recounting parameters,
others with properties that are invariant under the rotation.
We prove also that the finite sequence is either clockwise oriented
or it is such after reversing.
Everything is proved for the so called standard finite sequences, which means
that if a point belongs to it then every point with the same abscissa or
with the same ordinate, that belongs to the polygon, belongs also to
the finite sequence. It does not seem that this requirement causes
serious technical obstacles.}}
