  SUMMARY = {In this article we introduce and prove properties of
  simplicial complexes in real linear spaces which are necessary to formulate Sperner's
  lemma. The lemma states that for a function $f$, which for an arbitrary
  vertex $v$ of the barycentric subdivision $\mathcal{B}$ of simplex $\mathcal{K}$
  assigns some vertex from a face of $\mathcal{K}$ which contains $v$,
  we can find a simplex $S$ of $\mathcal{B}$ which satisfies $f(S)=\mathcal{K}$
  (see \cite{ENGEL:BM61}).}}
