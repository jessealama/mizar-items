  SUMMARY = {A continuation of \cite{SETWISEO.ABS}.
The propositions and theorems proved in \cite{SETWISEO.ABS} are extended to
finite sequences. Several additional theorems related to semigroup
operations of functions not included in \cite{SETWISEO.ABS} are proved.
The special notation for operations on finite sequences is introduced. }}
