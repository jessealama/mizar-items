  SUMMARY = {The article includes schemes of defining by structural induction, and
definitions and theorems related to:
the set of variables which have free occurrences in a ZF-formula,
the set of all valuations of variables in a model,
the set of all valuations which satisfy a ZF-formula in a model,
the satisfiability of a ZF-formula in a model by a valuation,
the validity of a ZF-formula in a model,
the axioms of ZF-language,
the model of the ZF set theory.}}
