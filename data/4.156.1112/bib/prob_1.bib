  SUMMARY = {This article contains definitions and theorems concerning basic
properties of following objects:
- a field of subsets of given nonempty set;
- a sequence of subsets of given nonempty set;
- a $\sigma$-field of subsets of given nonempty set and events from this $\sigma$-field;
- a probability i.e. $\sigma$-additive normed measure defined on previously
  introduced $\sigma$-field;
- a $\sigma$-field generated by family of subsets of given set;
- family of Borel Sets.}}
