  SUMMARY = {An introduction to the rearrangement theory for finite functions (e.g. with
the finite domain and codomain). The notion of generators and cogenerators of
finite sets (equivalent to the order in the language of finite sequences)
has been defined. The notion of rearrangement for a function into finite set is
presented. Some basic properties of these notions have been proved.}}
