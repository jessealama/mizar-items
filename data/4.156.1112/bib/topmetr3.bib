  SUMMARY = {Relations of convergence of real sequences and convergence of
metric spaces are investigated.
   An abstract intermediate value theorem for two closed sets in the
range is presented.
   At the end, it is proven that an arc connecting the west minimal point
and the east maximal point in a simple closed curve must be identical to
the upper arc or lower arc of the closed curve.}}
