  SUMMARY = {In the article we define partial functions.
We also define the following notions related to partial functions
and functions themselves:
the empty function, the restriction of a function to a partial function from a set
into a set, the set of all partial functions from a set into a set, 
the total functions, the relation of tolerance of two functions and 
the set of all total functions which are tolerated by a partial function.
Some simple propositions related to the introduced notions are proved.
In the beginning of this article we prove some auxiliary theorems 
and schemes related to the articles: \cite{FUNCT_1.ABS} and \cite{FUNCT_2.ABS}.}}
