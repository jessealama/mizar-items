  SUMMARY = {Based on concepts introduced in \cite{REWRITE3.ABS},
  semiautomata and left-languages, automata and right-languages,
  and langauges accepted by automata are defined.
  The powerset construction is defined for transition systems, semiautomata
  and automata. Finally, the equivalence of epsilon, nondeterministic [finite] automata
  and deterministic [finite] automata is shown, respectively.}}
