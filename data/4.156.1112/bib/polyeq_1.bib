  SUMMARY = {In this paper, we describe the definition of the first, second, and third degree
algebraic equations and their properties.
In Section 1, we defined the simple first-degree and second-degree (quadratic)
 equation and discussed the relation between the roots of each equation and
their coefficients. Also, we clarified the form of the root within the range
of real numbers. Furthermore, the extraction of the root using the discriminant
of equation is clarified.
In Section 2, we defined the third-degree (cubic) equation and clarified the
relation between the three roots of this equation and its coefficient. Also,
the form of these roots for various conditions is discussed. This solution
is known as the Cardano solution.}}
