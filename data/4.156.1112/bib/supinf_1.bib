  SUMMARY = {We introduce some properties of the least upper bound and
the greatest lower bound of the subdomain of $\overline{\Bbb R}$ numbers, where $\overline{\Bbb R}$
denotes the enlarged set of real numbers, $\overline{\Bbb R} = {\Bbb R} \cup \{-\infty,+\infty\}$.
The paper contains definitions of majorant and minorant elements, bounded
from above, bounded from below and bounded sets,  sup  and  inf  of set, for
nonempty subset of $\overline{\Bbb R}$. We prove theorems describing the basic
relationships among those definitions. The work is the first part
of the series of articles concerning the Lebesgue measure theory.}}
