  SUMMARY = { In the class of abelian groups a 
 subclass of two-divisible-groups is singled out, and in the latter,
 a subclass of uniquely-two-divisible-groups. With every such a group
 a special geometrical structure, more precisely the 
 structure of ``congruence of vectors'' is correlated. The notion of 
 ``affine vector space'' (denoted by AffVect) is introduced. This term is defined by
 means of suitable axiom system. It is proved that every structure of 
 the congruence of vectors determined by a non trivial uniquely two 
 divisible group  is a affine vector space.}}
