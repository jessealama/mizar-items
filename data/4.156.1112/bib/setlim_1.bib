  SUMMARY = {A concept of "limit of sequence of subsets"
  is defined here. This article contains the following items:
  1. definition of the superior sequence and the inferior
  sequence of sets. 2. definition of the superior limit
  and the inferior limit of sets,
  and additional properties for the sigma-field of sets.
  and 3, definition of the limit value of a convergent
  sequence of sets, and additional properties for the sigma-field of sets.}}
