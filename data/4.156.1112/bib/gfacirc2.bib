  SUMMARY = {We continue to formalize the concept of the Generalized Full
   Addition and Subtraction circuits (GFAs), define the structures of calculation
   units for the Redundant Signed Digit (RSD) operations, then prove its
   stability of the calculations. Generally, one-bit binary full adder assumes
   positive weights to all of its three binary inputs and two outputs.
   We define the circuit structure of two-types n-bit GFAs using the recursive
   construction to use the RSD arithmetic logical units that we generalize
   full adder to have both positive and negative weights to inputs and outputs.
   The motivation for this research is to establish a technique based on
   formalized mathematics and its applications for calculation circuits
   with high reliability.}}
