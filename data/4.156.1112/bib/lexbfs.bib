  SUMMARY = {We are formalizing the algorithm for recognizing
  chordal graphs by lexicographic breadth-first search
  as presented in \cite[Section 3 of Chapter 4, pp.~81--84]{Golumbic}.
  Then we follow with a formalization of another algorithm
  serving the same end but based on maximum cardinality
  search as presented by Tarjan and Yannakakis~\cite{TY84}.\par
  This work is a part of the MSc work of the first author
  under supervision of the second author.
  We would like to thank one of the anonymous reviewers
  for very useful suggestions.}}
