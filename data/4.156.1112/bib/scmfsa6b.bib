  SUMMARY = {    We define the semantics of macro instructions (introduced in
    \cite{SCMFSA6A.ABS}) in terms of executions of ${\bf SCM}_{\rm FSA}$.
    In a similar way, we define the semantics of macro composition.
    Several attributes of macro instructions are introduced
		  (paraclosed, parahalting, keeping 0) and their
    usage enables a systematic treatment of the composition of macro
    intructions.
    This article is continued in \cite{SCMFSA6C.ABS}.}}
