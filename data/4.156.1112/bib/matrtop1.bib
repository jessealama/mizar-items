  SUMMARY = {We introduce linear transformations of Euclidean topological
             spaces given by a transformation matrix. Next we prove selected
             properties and basic arithmetic operations on these linear
             transformations. Finally, we show that a linear transformation
	     given by an invertible matrix is a homeomorphism.}}
