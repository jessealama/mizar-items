  SUMMARY = {This article is a continuation of \cite{TAXONOM1.ABS} article. Further properties
         of classification of sets are proved. The notion of hierarchy of a set
         is introduced. Properties of partitions and hierarchies are shown. The main
         theorem says that for each hierarchy there exists a classification
         which union equals to the considered hierarchy.}}
