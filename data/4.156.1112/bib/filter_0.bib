  SUMMARY = {Filters of a lattice, maximal filters
(ultrafilters), operation to create a filter generating by an element or
by a non-empty subset of the lattice are discussed.
Besides, there are introduced
implicative lattices such that
for every two elements there is an element being pseudo-complement of them.
Some facts concerning these concepts are presented too,
i.e. for any proper filter there exists an ultrafilter consisting it.}}
