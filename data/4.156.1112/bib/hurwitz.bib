  SUMMARY = {A complex polynomial is called a Hurwitz polynomial if all
   its roots have a real part smaller than zero. This kind of
   polynomial plays an all-dominant role in stability checks of
   electrical networks.\par
   In this article we prove Schur's criterion \cite{SCHUR:1} that
   allows to decide whether a polynomial $p(x)$ is Hurwitz without
   explicitly computing its roots: Schur's recursive algorithm successively
   constructs polynomials $p_i(x)$ of lesser degree by division
   with $x-c$, $\Re\{c\} < 0$, such that $p_i(x)$ is Hurwitz if and only
   if $p(x)$ is.}}
