  SUMMARY = {We define pseudocompact topological spaces and prove
   that every compact space is pseudocompact. We also solve an
   exercise from \cite{mgm}~p.225 that for a topological space $X$
   the following are equivalent:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item  Every continuous real map from $X$ is bounded (i.e. $X$ 
   is pseudocompact).
   \item  Every continuous real map from $X$ attains minimum.
   \item  Every continuous real map from $X$ attains maximum.
   \end{itemize}
   Finally, for a compact set in $E^2$ we define its bounding rectangle and
   introduce a collection of notions associated with the box.}}
