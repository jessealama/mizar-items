  SUMMARY = {Basic operations in the set of partial
functions which map a domain to the set of all real numbers are introduced.
They include adition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
multipication by a real number and also module.
 Main properties of these operations are proved. A definition of the partial
function bounded on a set (bounded below and bounded above) is presented.
 There are theorems showing the laws of conservation of totality and
boundedness for operations of partial functions.
The characteristic function of a subset of a domain as
a partial function is redefined and a few properties are proved.}}
