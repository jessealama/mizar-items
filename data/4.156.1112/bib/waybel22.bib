  SUMMARY = {We present the Mizar formalization of theorem 4.17,
  Chapter I from \cite{CCL}: a free continuous
  lattice with $m$ generators is isomorphic to the lattice of
  filters of $2^X$ ($\overline{\overline{X}} = m$) which is freely
  generated by $\{\uparrow x : x \in X\}$ (the set of ultrafilters).}}
