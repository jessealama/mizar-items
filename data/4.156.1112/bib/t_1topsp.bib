  SUMMARY = {This article contains a definition of $T_{1}$ reflex of a topological space as
a quotient space which is $T_{1}$ and fulfils
the condition that every continuous map $f$ from a topological space $T$ into
 $S$ being $T_{1}$ space can be considered as a superposition of two continuous
maps: the first from $T$ onto its $T_{1}$ reflex and the last from $T_{1}$
reflex of $T$ into $S$.}}
