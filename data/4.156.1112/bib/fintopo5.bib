  SUMMARY = {In this paper, we first introduced the notion of 
   homeomorphism between finite topological spaces.
   We also gave a fixed point theorem in finite topological space.
   Next, we showed two 2-dimensional concrete models of lattice spaces.
   One was 2-dimensional linear finite topological space.
   Another was 2-dimensional small finite topological space.}}
