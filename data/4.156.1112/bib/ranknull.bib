  SUMMARY = {The rank+nullity theorem states that, if $T$ is a
            linear transformation from a finite-dimensional
            vector space $V$ to a finite-dimensional vector
            space $W$, then $\dim(V) = \mathrm{rank}(T) +
            \mathrm{nullity}(T)$, where $\mathrm{rank}(T) =
            \dim(\mathrm{im}(T))$ and $\mathrm{nullity}(T) =
            \dim(\mathrm{ker}(T))$.  The proof treated here is
            standard; see, for example, \cite{lang-algebra}:
            take a basis $A$ of $\mathrm{ker}(T)$ and extend it
            to a basis $B$ of $V$, and then show that
            $\dim(\mathrm{im}(T)$ is equal to $|B - A|$, and that
            $T$ is one-to-one on $B - A$.},
