  SUMMARY = { Proofs of two theorems connected with union of
    any two functions and the proofs of two theorems about continuity of
   the  union of two continuous functions between topogical spaces.   The
    theorem stating that union of two subsets of $R^2$, which are homeomorphic
    to unit interval and have only one terminal joined point is also
    homeomorphic to unit interval is proved, too.}}
