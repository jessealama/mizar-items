  SUMMARY = {In this paper the theory of invertibility of
  matrices of field elements (see e.g. \cite{Furuya:57},
  \cite{Gantmacher:59})
  is developed. The main purpose of this article is to prove that
  the left invertibility and the right invertibility are equivalent
  for a matrix of field elements.
  To prove this, we introduced a special transformation of
  matrix to some canonical form.
  Other concepts as zero vector and base vectors of field
  elements are also introduced as a preparation.}}
