  SUMMARY = {In this paper we introduce the notion of general position.
         We also show some auxiliary theorems for proving Jordan curve
         theorem. The following main theorems are proved:
  \begin{enumerate}
        \item End points of a polygon are in the same component
            of a complement of another polygon if number of common points
            of these polygons is even;
        \item Two points of polygon $L$ are in the same component
            of a complement of polygon $M$ if two points of polygon $M$
            are in the same component of polygon $L.$
  \end{enumerate}}}
