  SUMMARY = {In the paper, two short axiom systems for Boolean algebras are introduced.
  In the first section we show that the single axiom (DN${}_1$) proposed
  in \cite{McCune:2001} in terms of disjunction and negation
  characterizes Boolean algebras. To prove that (DN${}_1$) is a single
  axiom for Robbins algebras (that is, Boolean algebras as well), we
  use the Otter theorem prover.
  The second section contains proof that the two classical axioms
  (Meredith${}_1$), (Meredith${}_2$)
  proposed by Meredith \cite{Meredith:1968} may also serve as a basis for
  Boolean algebras.
  The results will be used to characterize ortholattices.}}
