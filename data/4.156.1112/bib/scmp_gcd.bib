  SUMMARY = {The earlier SCM computer did not contain recursive function,
  so Trybulec and Nakamura proved the correctness of the Euclid's algorithm
  only by way of an iterative program. However, the recursive method is
  a very important programming method, furthermore, for some algorithms, for
  example Quicksort, only by employing a recursive method (note push-down
  stack is essentially also a recursive method) can they be implemented.
  The main goal of the article is to test the recursive function of
  the SCMPDS computer by proving the correctness of the Euclid's
  algorithm by way of a recursive program. In this article, we observed that
  the memory required by the recursive Euclide algorithm is variable but
  it is still autonomic. Although the algorithm here is more complicated
  than the non-recursive algorithm, its focus is that the SCMPDS
  computer will be able to implement many algorithms like Quicksort which
  the SCM computer cannot do.}}
