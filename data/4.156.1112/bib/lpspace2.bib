  SUMMARY = {This article is the continuation of \cite{LPSPACE1.ABS}.
  We define the set of $L^p$ integrable functions -- the set of all partial
  functions whose absolute value raised to the $p$-th power is integrable.
  We show that $L^p$ integrable functions form the $L^p$ space.
  We also prove Minkowski's inequality, H\"{o}lder's inequality and that
  $L^p$ space is Banach space (\cite{Halmos:1974}, \cite{Rudin:1987}).}}
