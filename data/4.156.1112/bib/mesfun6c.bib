  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalized the notion of the integral of
   a complex-valued function considered as a sum of its real and imaginary
   parts. Then we defined the measurability and integrability in
   this context, and proved the linearity and several other basic properties
   of complex-valued measurable functions. The set of properties showed
   in this paper is based on \cite{MESFUNC6.ABS}, where the case
   of real-valued measurable functions is considered.}}
