  SUMMARY = {Several configuration axioms, which are commonly
called in the literature ``Pasch Axioms" are introduced; 
three of them were investigated
by Szmielew and concern invariantability of the betweenness relation under
parallel projections, and two other were introduced by Tarski.
It is demonstrated that
they all are consequences of the trapezium axiom, adopted to
characterize ordered affine spaces.}}
