  SUMMARY = {First, we prove the fact that the circle is the simple closed curve,
which was defined as a curve homeomorphic to the square.
   For this proof, we introduce a mapping which is a homeomorphism from 
2-dimensional plane to itself. This mapping maps the square to the circle.
   Secondly, we prove the Fashoda meet theorem for the circle using
this homeomorphism.}}
