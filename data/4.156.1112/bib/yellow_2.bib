  SUMMARY = {In the paper we present some auxiliary facts
concerning posets and maps between them. Our main purpose,
however is to give an account on complete lattices and
lattices of ideals. A sufficient condition that a lattice
might be complete, the fixed-point theorem and two remarks
upon images of complete lattices in monotone maps, introduced
in \cite[pp. 8--9]{CCL},
can be found in Section~7. Section~8 deals with lattices
of ideals. We examine the meet and join of two ideals.
In order to show that the lattice of ideals is complete, the infinite
intersection of ideals is investigated.}}
