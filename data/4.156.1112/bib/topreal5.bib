  SUMMARY = {Various types of the intermediate value theorem (\cite {shilov}) are proved.   
For their
   special cases, the Bolzano theorem is also proved.
      Using such a theorem, it is shown that if a curve is a simple closed
   curve, then it is not horizontally degenerated, neither is it vertically
   degenerated.}}
