  SUMMARY = {The paper introduces some preliminary notions
concerning the graph theory according to \cite{Thomasse}.
We define Necklace $n$ as a graph with vertex $\{1,2,3,\dots,n\}$
and edge set $\{(1,2),(2,3),\dots,(n-1,n)\}.$
The goal of the article is to prove that Necklace $n$ and Complement
of Necklace $n$ are isomorphic for $n = 0, 1, 4.$ }}
