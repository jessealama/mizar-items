  SUMMARY = {In this paper we introduce the cartesian product of two metric
spaces. As the distance between two points in the product we take maximal
distance between coordinates of these points. In the main theorem we show
the homeomorphism between [:${\cal E}^i_{\rm T}, {\cal E}^j_{\rm T}$:] and 
 ${\cal E}^{i+j}_{\rm T}$.}}
