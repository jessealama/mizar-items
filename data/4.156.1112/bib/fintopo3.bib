  SUMMARY = {First we give a definition of ``inflation'' of a set
  in finite topological spaces.
   Then a concept of ``deflation'' of a set is also defined.
   In the remaining part, we give a concept of the ``set series''
   for a subset of a finite topological space.
   Using this, we can define a series of
neighbourhoods for each point in the space. The work is done
according to \cite{Nakamura:2}.}}
