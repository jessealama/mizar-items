  SUMMARY = {In this paper we characterize the automorphisms (collineations) of 
         the Segre product of partial linear spaces.
         In particular, we show that if all components of the product are strongly connected,
         then every collineation is determined by a set of isomorphisms between
         its components. The formalization follows the ideas presented in
	     the {\em Journal of Geometry} paper \cite{ANKPJG} by Naumowicz and Pra\.zmowski.}}
