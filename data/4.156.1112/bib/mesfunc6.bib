  SUMMARY = {Based on \cite{Halmos74}, authors formalized the integral
   of an extended real valued measurable function in \cite{MESFUNC5.ABS}
   before. However, the integral argued in \cite{MESFUNC5.ABS}
   cannot be applied to real-valued functions unconditionally.
   Therefore, in this article we have formalized the integral of
   a real-value function.}}
