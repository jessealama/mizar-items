  SUMMARY = {The first four sections of this article include
  some auxiliary theorems related to number and finite sequence
  of numbers, in particular a primality test, the Pocklington's
  theorem (see \cite{LeVeque}). The last section presents the
  formalization of Bertrand's postulate closely following the
  book \cite{PFTB}, pp. 7--9.}}
