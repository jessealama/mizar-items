  SUMMARY = {   This article is a continuation of \cite{TOPS_1.ABS}.
Some basic theorems about families
of sets in a topological space have been proved. Following redefinitions have
been made: singleton of a set as a family in the topological space and results
of boolean operations on families as a family of the topological space.
Notion of a family of complements of sets and a closed (open) family have been
also introduced. Next some theorems refer to subspaces in a topological space:
some facts about types in a subspace, theorems about open and closed sets
and families in a subspace. A notion of restriction of a family has been
also introduced and basic properties of this notion have been proved.
The last part of the article is about mappings. There are proved necessary
and sufficient conditions for a mapping to be continuous. A notion of
homeomorphism has been defined next. Theorems about homeomorphisms of
topological spaces have been also proved.}}
