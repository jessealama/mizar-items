  SUMMARY = {Finite-dimensional real linear spaces are defined. The dimension
of such spaces is the cardinality of a basis. Obviously, each two
basis have the same cardinality. We prove the Steinitz theorem
and the Exchange Lemma. We also investigate some fundamental facts
involving the dimension of real linear spaces.}}
