  SUMMARY = {In this paper, we define sequence dominated by $0$, 
  in which every initial fragment contains more zeroes than ones. 
  If $n \geq 2 \cdot m$ and $n>0$, then the number of sequences 
  dominated by $0$ the length $n$ including $m$ of ones, 
  is given by the formula 
  $$D(n,m)=\frac{n+1-2\cdot m}{n+1-m}\cdot{n \choose m}$$ 
  and satisfies the recurrence relation 
  $$D(n,m)=D(n-1,m)\:+\:\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} D(2\cdot i,i)\cdot 
  D(n-2\cdot(i+1),m - (i+1)).$$ 
  Obviously, if $n = 2 \cdot m$, then we obtain the recurrence 
  relation for the Catalan numbers (starting from $0$) 
  $$C_{m+1}=\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} C_{i+1}\cdot C_{m-i}.$$ 
  Using the above recurrence relation we can see 
  that $$\sum_{i=0}^\infty\,C_{i+1}
  \cdot x^i\,= \,1\,+\,\left(\sum_{i=0}^\infty\, C_{i+1}\cdot x^i\right)^2$$ 
  where ($| x |< \frac{1}{4}$) and hence 
  $$\sum_{i=0}^\infty\, C_{i+1}\cdot x^i\,= \,
  \frac{1-\sqrt[]{1-4\cdot x}}{2\cdot x}.$$}}
