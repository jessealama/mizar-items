  SUMMARY = {We discuss here some methods for reconstructing special sequences
which generate special polygonal arcs in ${\cal E}^{2}_{\rm T}$.
 For such reconstructions
we introduce a ``mid" function which cuts out the middle part of
a sequence; the ``$\downharpoonleft$" function, which cuts down the left part
of a sequence at some point; the ``$\downharpoonright$" function for 
cutting down the
right part at some point; and the ``$\downharpoonleft \downharpoonright$" 
function for cutting down both
sides at two given points.\par
  We also introduce some methods glueing two special sequences.
  By such cutting and glueing methods, the speciality of sequences
(generatability of special polygonal arcs) is shown to be preserved.}}
