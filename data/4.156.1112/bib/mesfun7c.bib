  SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalized the measurability of
  complex-valued functional sequences. First, we proved the
  measurability of the limits of real-valued functional sequences.
  Next, we defined complex-valued functional sequences dividing real
  part into imaginary part. Then using the former theorems,
  we proved the measurability of each part. Lastly we proved
  the measurability of the limits of complex-valued functional sequences.
  We also showed several properties of complex-valued measurable functions.
  In addition, we proved properties of complex-valued simple functions.}}
