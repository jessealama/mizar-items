  SUMMARY = {A continuation of \cite{TREES_1.ABS}.
    The notion of finite--order trees, succesors of an element of a tree,
    and chains, levels and branches of a tree are introduced.
    That notion has been used to formalize K\"onig's Lemma which claims that
    there is a infinite branch of a finite-order tree if the tree has arbitrary
    long finite chains.
    Besides, the concept of decorated trees is introduced and
    some concepts dealing with trees are applied to decorated trees.}}
