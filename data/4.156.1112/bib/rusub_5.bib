  SUMMARY = {In this article we introduce three subjects in real unitary space:
parallelism of subsets, orthogonality of subsets and topology of the space.
In particular, to introduce the topology of real unitary space, we discuss
the metric topology which is induced by the inner product in the space.
As the result, we are able to discuss some topological subjects on real
unitary space.}}
