  SUMMARY = {In the paper some notions useful in formalization of \cite{CCL} are introduced,
e.g. the definition of the poset of subsets of a set with inclusion as an
ordering relation. Using the theory of many sorted sets authors  formulate 
the definition
of product of relational structures.}}
