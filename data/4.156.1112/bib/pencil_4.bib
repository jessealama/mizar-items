  SUMMARY = {In this paper we construct several examples of partial linear
 spaces. First, we define two algebraic structures, namely the spaces of
 $k$-pencils and Grassmann spaces for vector spaces over an arbitrary field.
 Then we introduce the notion of generalized Veronese spaces following the
 definition presented in the paper \cite{ANKPRM} by Naumowicz and Pra\.zmowski.
 For all spaces defined, we state the conditions under which they are not
 degenerated to a single line.}}
