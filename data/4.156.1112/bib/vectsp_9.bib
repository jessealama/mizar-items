  SUMMARY = {   The main purpose of the paper is to define the
    dimension of an abstract vector space. The dimension
    of a finite-dimensional vector space is, by the most
    common definition, the number of vectors in a basis.
    Obviously, each basis contains the same number of vectors.
    We prove the Steinitz Theorem together
    with Exchange Lemma in the second section.
    The Steinitz Theorem says that each linearly-independent
    subset of a vector space has cardinality less than any
    subset that generates the space, moreover it can be
    extended to a basis. Further we review some of the
    standard facts involving the dimension of a vector space.
    Additionally, in the last section, we introduce two
    notions: the family of subspaces of a fixed dimension
    and the pencil of subspaces. Both of them can be applied
    in the algebraic representation of several geometries.}}
