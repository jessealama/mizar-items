  SUMMARY = {In this paper, we first defined the partial-union
  sequence, the partial-intersection sequence, and the
  partial-difference-union sequence of given sequence of subsets,
  and then proved the additive theorem of infinite sequences and
  sub-additive theorem of finite sequences for probability.
  Further, we defined the monotone class of families of subsets,
  and discussed about the relations between the monotone class and
  the $\sigma$-field which are generated by field of subsets of a
  given set.}}
