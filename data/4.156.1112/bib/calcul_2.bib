  SUMMARY = {This article is part of a series of Mizar articles
              which constitute a formal proof (of a basic version)
              of Kurt G{\"{o}}del's famous completeness theorem
              (K. G{\"{o}}del, ``Die Vollst{\"{a}}ndigkeit der
              Axiome des logischen Funktionenkalk{\"{u}}ls'',
              Monatshefte f\"ur Mathematik und Physik 37 (1930),
              349-360). The completeness theorem provides the
              theoretical basis for a uniform formalization of
              mathematics as in the Mizar project. We formalize
              first-order logic up to the completeness theorem as
              in H. D. Ebbinghaus, J. Flum, and W. Thomas,
              Mathematical Logic, 1984, Springer Verlag New York
              Inc. The first main result of the present article is
              that the derivablility of a sequent doesn't depend
              on the ordering of the antecedent. The second main
              result says: if a sequent is derivable, then the
              formulas in the antecendent only need to occur
              once.}}
