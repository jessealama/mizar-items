  SUMMARY = {    This article is a continuation of \cite{SCMFSA6A.ABS} and
    \cite{SCMFSA6C.ABS}.  First, we recast the semantics of the
	macro composition in more convenient terms.
	Then, we introduce terminology and
	basic properties of macros constructed out of single instructions
	of ${\bf SCM}_{\rm FSA}$.  We give the complete semantics of composing a macro
	instruction with an instruction and for composing two machine
	instructions (this is also done in terms of macros).
	The introduced terminology is tested on the simple example
	of a macro for swapping two integer locations.}}
