theorem
L8: ( REAL+ ) = { B1 where B1 is Real : ( 0 ) <= B1 }
proof
set D1 = { B2 where B2 is Real : ( 0 ) <= B2 };
thus L9: ( REAL+ ) c= D1
proof
let C6 being set;
assume L10: C6 in ( REAL+ );
reconsider D2 = C6 as Real by L10 , ARYTM_0:1;
reconsider D3 = ( 0 ) , D4 = D2 as (Element of ( REAL+ )) by ARYTM_2:20 , L10;
L11: D3 <=' D4 by ARYTM_1:6;
L12: ( 0 ) <= D2 by L11 , ARYTM_2:20 , XXREAL_0:def 5;
thus L13: C6 in D1 by L12;
end;

let C7 being set;
assume L14: C7 in D1;
L15: (ex B3 being Real st (C7 = B3 & ( 0 ) <= B3)) by L14;
L16: (not ( 0 ) in [: { ( 0 ) } , ( REAL+ ) :]) by ARYTM_0:5 , XBOOLE_0:3 , ARYTM_2:20;
thus L17: C7 in ( REAL+ ) by L16 , L15 , XXREAL_0:def 5;
