theorem
L1215: (for R6 being (Point of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) holds (R6 in ( west_halfline R6 ) & R6 in ( east_halfline R6 ) & R6 in ( north_halfline R6 ) & R6 in ( south_halfline R6 )))
proof
let R6 being (Point of ( TOP-REAL 2 ));
L1216: ( R6 `2 ) = ( R6 `2 );
L1217: ( R6 `1 ) <= ( R6 `1 );
thus L1218: thesis by L1217 , L1216 , L1101 , L1104 , L1107 , L1110;
