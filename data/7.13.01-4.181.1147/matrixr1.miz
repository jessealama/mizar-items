theorem
L663: (for B211 , B212 being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for B213 being (FinSequence of ( REAL )) holds ((( len B213 ) = B211 & B211 > ( 0 )) implies ( B213 * ( 0_Rmatrix (B211 , B212) ) ) = ( 0* B212 ))))
proof
let C185 , C186 being (Element of ( NAT ));
let C187 being (FinSequence of ( REAL ));
assume that
L664: ( len C187 ) = C185
and
L665: C185 > ( 0 );
L666: ( len ( 0_Rmatrix (C185 , C186) ) ) = C185 by L665 , MATRIX_1:23;
L667: ( len ( C187 * ( 0_Rmatrix (C185 , C186) ) ) ) = ( width ( 0_Rmatrix (C185 , C186) ) ) by L666 , L664 , L630;
L668: ( width ( 0_Rmatrix (C185 , C186) ) ) = C186 by L665 , MATRIX_1:23;
L669: ( C187 * ( 0_Rmatrix (C185 , C186) ) ) = ( C187 * ( ( 0_Rmatrix (C185 , C186) ) + ( 0_Rmatrix (C185 , C186) ) ) ) by L668 , L665 , L666 , L219

L670: ( 0* C186 ) = ( ( ( C187 * ( 0_Rmatrix (C185 , C186) ) ) + ( C187 * ( 0_Rmatrix (C185 , C186) ) ) ) - ( C187 * ( 0_Rmatrix (C185 , C186) ) ) ) by L669 , L668 , L667 , L3;
