theorem
L746: (for B219 being non  empty TopSpace holds (for B220 being non  empty  pathwise_connected TopSpace holds (for B221 being (Point of B219) holds (for B222 being (Point of B220) holds (B219 , B220 are_homeomorphic  implies ( pi_1 (B219 , B221) ) , ( pi_1 (B220 , B222) ) are_isomorphic )))))
proof
let C300 being non  empty TopSpace;
let C301 being non  empty  pathwise_connected TopSpace;
let C302 being (Point of C300);
let C303 being (Point of C301);
given C304 being (Function of C300 , C301) such that
L747: C304 is  being_homeomorphism;

reconsider D109 = C304 as  continuous (Function of C300 , C301) by L747 , TOPS_2:def 5;
set D110 = the (Path of C303 , ( D109 . C302 ));
take ( ( pi_1-iso D110 ) * ( FundGrIso (D109 , C302) ) );
L748: ( FundGrIso (D109 , C302) ) is  bijective by L747 , L702;
thus L749: thesis by L748 , GROUP_6:64;
