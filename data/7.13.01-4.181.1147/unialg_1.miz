theorem
L18: (for R1 being Nat holds (for R2 being  partial  non-empty non  empty UAStr holds (R1 in ( dom (the charact of R2) ) implies ( (the charact of R2) . R1 ) is (PartFunc of ( (the carrier of R2) * ) , (the carrier of R2)))))
proof
let R1 being Nat;
let R2 being  partial  non-empty non  empty UAStr;
set D7 = (the charact of R2);
assume L19: R1 in ( dom D7 );
L20: ( D7 . R1 ) in ( rng D7 ) by L19 , FUNCT_1:def 3;
L21: ( rng D7 ) c= ( PFuncs (( (the carrier of R2) * ) , (the carrier of R2)) ) by FINSEQ_1:def 4;
thus L22: thesis by L21 , L20 , PARTFUN1:47;
end;

existence
proof
defpred S1[ Nat , set ] means (for B2 being  homogeneous non  empty (PartFunc of ( (the carrier of R2) * ) , (the carrier of R2)) holds (B2 = ( (the charact of R2) . $1 ) implies $2 = ( arity B2 )));
