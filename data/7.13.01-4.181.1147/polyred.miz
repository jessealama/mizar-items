proof
let C722 being Ordinal;
let C723 being  connected (TermOrder of C722);
let C724 being  Abelian  add-associative  right_complementable  right_zeroed  commutative  associative  well-unital  distributive  almost_left_invertible non  trivial doubleLoopStr;
let C725 being (Subset of ( Polynom-Ring (C722 , C724) ));
let C726 being (Polynomial of C722 , C724);
assume L1838: ( PolyRedRel (C725 , C723) ) reduces C726 , ( 0_ (C722 , C724) );
L1839: ( C726 - ( 0_ (C722 , C724) ) ) in ( C725 -Ideal ) by L1838 , L1829;
thus L1840: thesis by L1839 , L210;
