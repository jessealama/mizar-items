theorem
L1462: (for R22 being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for R31 being (FinSequence of ( REAL )) holds (( len R31 ) = R22 implies R31 in (the carrier of ( Euclid R22 )))))
proof
let R22 being (Element of ( NAT ));
let R31 being (FinSequence of ( REAL ));
L1463: (R31 in ( ( REAL ) * ) & ( R22 -tuples_on ( REAL ) ) = { B18 where B18 is (Element of ( ( REAL ) * )) : ( len B18 ) = R22 }) by FINSEQ_1:def 11 , FINSEQ_2:def 4;

theorem
L1465: (for R22 being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for R31 being (FinSequence of ( REAL )) holds (( len R31 ) = R22 implies R31 in (the carrier of ( TOP-REAL R22 )))))
proof
let R22 being (Element of ( NAT ));
let R31 being (FinSequence of ( REAL ));
