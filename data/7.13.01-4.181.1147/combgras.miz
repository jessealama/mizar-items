L2708: (for R1 being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for B387 being non  empty set holds ((( 0 ) < R1 & ( R1 + 1 ) c= ( card B387 )) implies (for B388 being IncProjMap over ( G_ (R1 , B387) ) , ( G_ (R1 , B387) ) holds (B388 is  automorphism iff (ex B389 being (Permutation of B387) st ( the IncProjMap of B388 ) = ( incprojmap (R1 , B389) )))))))
proof
let R1 being (Element of ( NAT ));
let C516 being non  empty set;
assume that
L2709: ( 0 ) < R1

L2725: ((ex B391 being (Permutation of C516) st ( the IncProjMap of C517 ) = ( incprojmap (R1 , B391) )) implies C517 is  automorphism)
proof
assume L2726: (ex B392 being (Permutation of C516) st ( the IncProjMap of C517 ) = ( incprojmap (R1 , B392) ));
