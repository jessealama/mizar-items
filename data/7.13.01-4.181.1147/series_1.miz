theorem
L944: (for R7 being Real_Sequence holds (for R8 being Real_Sequence holds (((for R1 being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( R8 . R1 ) = ( R1 -root ( ( abs R7 ) . R1 ) )) & R8 is  convergent & ( lim R8 ) > 1) implies (not R7 is  summable))))
proof
let R7 being Real_Sequence;
let R8 being Real_Sequence;
assume that
L945: (for R1 being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( R8 . R1 ) = ( R1 -root ( ( abs R7 ) . R1 ) ))
and
L946: R8 is  convergent
and
L947: ( lim R8 ) > 1;
L948: ( ( lim R8 ) - 1 ) > ( 0 ) by L947 , XREAL_1:50;
consider R2 being (Element of ( NAT )) such that L949: (for R1 being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (R1 >= R2 implies ( abs ( ( R8 . R1 ) - ( lim R8 ) ) ) < ( ( lim R8 ) - 1 ))) by L948 , L946 , SEQ_2:def 7;
L950:
now
let R1 being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume that
L951: R1 >= ( R2 + 1 );
L952: ( R8 . R1 ) = ( R1 -root ( ( abs R7 ) . R1 ) ) by L945
.= ( R1 -root ( abs ( R7 . R1 ) ) ) by SEQ_1:12;
L953: ( R2 + 1 ) >= R2 by NAT_1:11;
L954: R1 >= R2 by L953 , L951 , XXREAL_0:2;
L955: ( abs ( ( R1 -root ( abs ( R7 . R1 ) ) ) - ( lim R8 ) ) ) < ( ( lim R8 ) - 1 ) by L954 , L949 , L952;
L956: ( - ( ( lim R8 ) - 1 ) ) < ( ( R1 -root ( abs ( R7 . R1 ) ) ) - ( lim R8 ) ) by L955 , SEQ_2:1;
L957: ( ( 1 - ( lim R8 ) ) + ( lim R8 ) ) < ( ( ( R1 -root ( abs ( R7 . R1 ) ) ) - ( lim R8 ) ) + ( lim R8 ) ) by L956 , XREAL_1:6;
L958: (( abs ( R7 . R1 ) ) >= ( 0 ) & ( ( R1 -root ( abs ( R7 . R1 ) ) ) |^ R1 ) >= 1) by L957 , COMPLEX1:46 , PREPOWER:11;
L959: ( R2 + 1 ) >= 1 by NAT_1:11;
L960: R1 >= 1 by L959 , L951 , XXREAL_0:2;
thus L961: ( abs ( R7 . R1 ) ) >= 1 by L960 , L958 , POWER:4;
end;
L962: ((not R7 is  convergent) or ( lim R7 ) <> ( 0 )) by L950 , L876;
thus L963: thesis by L962 , L128;
