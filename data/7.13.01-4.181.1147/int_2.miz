theorem
L467: (for B23 , B24 being Integer holds ((B23 >= ( 0 ) & B24 >= ( 0 )) implies (( ( abs B23 ) mod ( abs B24 ) ) = ( B23 mod B24 ) & ( ( abs B23 ) div ( abs B24 ) ) = ( B23 div B24 ))))
proof
let C35 , C36 being Integer;
assume that
L468: C35 >= ( 0 )
and
L469: C36 >= ( 0 );
per cases  by L469 , XXREAL_0:1;
suppose L470: C36 > ( 0 );

L471: C35 = ( abs C35 ) by L468 , ABSVALUE:def 1;
thus L472: thesis by L471 , L470 , ABSVALUE:def 1;
end;
suppose L473: C36 = ( 0 );

L474: ( abs ( 0 ) ) = ( 0 ) by ABSVALUE:def 1;
L475: (( ( abs C35 ) mod ( abs ( 0 ) ) ) = ( 0 ) & ( ( abs C35 ) div ( abs ( 0 ) ) ) = ( 0 )) by L474 , INT_1:48 , INT_1:def 10;
thus L476: thesis by L475 , L473 , INT_1:48 , INT_1:def 10;

L495: (C38 divides R9 & C38 divides R10) by L494 , L492 , L491 , L230;
thus L496: C38 divides ( R9 gcd R10 ) by L495 , L156;
