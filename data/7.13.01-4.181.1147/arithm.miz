theorem
L1: (for R1 being  complex number holds ( R1 + ( 0 ) ) = R1)
proof
let R1 being  complex number;
L2: R1 in ( COMPLEX ) by XCMPLX_0:def 2;
consider C1 , C2 being (Element of ( REAL )) such that L3: R1 = [* C1 , C2 *] by L2 , ARYTM_0:9;

thus L6: thesis by L5;
end;
L7: ( - ( 0 ) ) = ( 0 )
proof
L8: ( ( 0 ) + ( - ( 0 ) ) ) = ( - ( 0 ) ) by L1;
thus L9: thesis by L8 , XCMPLX_0:def 6;
end;
L10: ( opp ( 0 ) ) = ( 0 )
proof
L11: ( + (( 0 ) , ( 0 )) ) = ( 0 ) by ARYTM_0:11;

proof

proof
let R1 being  complex number;

proof
let R1 being  complex number;

proof
let R1 being  complex number;
