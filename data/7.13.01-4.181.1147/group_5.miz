assume L714: C44 is  commutative  commutative  commutative  commutative Group;
L715:
now
let C45 being (Element of C44);
L716: (for B38 being (Element of C44) holds ( C45 * B38 ) = ( B38 * C45 )) by L714 , L179;
thus L717: C45 in ( center C44 ) by L716 , L667;
end;
thus L718: thesis by L715 , GROUP_2:62;
end;

assume L719: ( center C44 ) = C44;
L720: C44 is  commutative
proof
let C46 , C47 being (Element of C44);
L721: C46 in C44 by STRUCT_0:def 5;
thus L722: thesis by L721 , L719 , L667;
end;
thus L723: thesis by L720;
end;
