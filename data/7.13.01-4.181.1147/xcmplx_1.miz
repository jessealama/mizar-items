theorem
L547: (for R1 being  complex number holds (for R2 being  complex number holds (for R3 being  complex number holds (R1 <> ( 0 ) implies ( ( R1 * R2 ) + R3 ) = ( R1 * ( R2 + ( R3 / R1 ) ) )))))
proof
let R1 being  complex number;
let R2 being  complex number;
let R3 being  complex number;
assume L548: R1 <> ( 0 );
thus L549: ( ( R1 * R2 ) + R3 ) = ( ( R1 * R2 ) + ( R1 * ( R3 / R1 ) ) ) by L548 , L47
.= ( R1 * ( R2 + ( R3 / R1 ) ) );
