proof
let C56 being  finite Chain;
set D47 = the (Function of C56 , ( InclPoset ( 0 ) ));
assume L390: ( card (the carrier of C56) ) = ( 0 );
L391: C56 is  empty by L390;
take D47;
L392: ( InclPoset ( 0 ) ) is  empty by YELLOW_1:1;
thus L393: thesis by L392 , L391 , WAYBEL_0:def 38;
end;
L394: (for B50 being Nat holds S1[ B50 ]) from NAT_1:sch 2(L389 , L298);
thus L395: thesis by L394;
