theorem
L199: (for R3 being Interval holds (for R4 being Interval holds (R3 c= R4 implies ( diameter R3 ) <= ( diameter R4 )))) by L172;
theorem
L200: (for R3 being Interval holds ( 0. ) <= ( diameter R3 )) by L164;
theorem
L201: (for B51 being (Subset of ( REAL )) holds (B51 is non  empty  closed_interval iff (ex B52 , B53 being Real st (B52 <= B53 & B51 = [. B52 , B53 .]))))
proof
let C49 being (Subset of ( REAL ));
thus L202: (C49 is non  empty  closed_interval implies (ex B54 , B55 being Real st (B54 <= B55 & C49 = [. B54 , B55 .])))
proof
assume L203: C49 is non  empty;
assume L204: C49 is  closed_interval;
consider C50 , C51 being  real number such that L205: C49 = [. C50 , C51 .] by L204 , L26;
reconsider D23 = C50 , D24 = C51 as Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
take D23;
take D24;
thus L206: D23 <= D24 by L203 , L205 , XXREAL_1:29;
thus L207: thesis by L205;
end;

thus L208: thesis by L26 , XXREAL_1:30;
