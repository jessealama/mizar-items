theorem
L637: (for B174 being  Boolean LATTICE holds (B174 is  arithmetic iff (B174 is  complete & (for B175 being (Element of B174) holds (ex B176 being (Subset of B174) st (B176 c= ( ATOM B174 ) & B175 = ( sup B176 )))))))
proof
let C156 being  Boolean LATTICE;
thus L638:now
assume L639: C156 is  arithmetic;
L640: ( C156 opp ) is  continuous by L639 , L153 , YELLOW_7:38;
L641: C156 is  completely-distributive by L640 , L639 , WAYBEL_6:39;
thus L642: (C156 is  complete & (for B177 being (Element of C156) holds (ex B178 being (Subset of C156) st (B178 c= ( ATOM C156 ) & B177 = ( sup B178 ))))) by L641 , L517;

L644: (ex B181 being set st C156 , ( BoolePoset B181 ) are_isomorphic ) by L643 , L552;
