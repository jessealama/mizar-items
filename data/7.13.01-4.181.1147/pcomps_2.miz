theorem
L614: (for R4 being non  empty TopSpace holds (R4 is  metrizable implies R4 is  paracompact))
proof
let R4 being non  empty TopSpace;
assume L615: R4 is  metrizable;
L616: (for B203 being (Subset-Family of R4) holds ((B203 is (Cover of R4) & B203 is  open) implies (ex B204 being (Subset-Family of R4) st (B204 is  open & B204 is (Cover of R4) & B204 is_finer_than B203 & B204 is  locally_finite)))) by L615 , L246;
thus L617: thesis by L616 , PCOMPS_1:def 3;
