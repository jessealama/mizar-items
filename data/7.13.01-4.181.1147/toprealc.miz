let C268 being (Point of D166);
let C269 being  positive  real number;
reconsider D168 = ( - C268 ) as (Point of D166) by L913;
consider C270 being  open (Subset of D166) such that L954: D168 in C270 and L955: ( C267 .: C270 ) c= ( Ball (( C267 . D168 ) , C269) ) by TOPS_4:18;
reconsider D169 = ( (-) C270 ) as  open (Subset of D166);
take D169;
L956: ( - D168 ) in D169 by L954 , L236;
thus L957: C268 in D169 by L956;
let C271 being (Element of ( TOP-REAL R5 ));
assume L958: C271 in ( D167 .: D169 );
consider C272 being (Element of D166) such that L959: C272 in D169 and L960: ( D167 . C272 ) = C271 by L958 , FUNCT_2:65;
L961: ( dom D167 ) = (the carrier of D166) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
L962: (( D167 . C272 ) = ( C267 . ( - C272 ) ) & ( D167 . C268 ) = ( C267 . ( - C268 ) )) by L961 , VALUED_2:def 34;
L963: ( - C272 ) in ( (-) D169 ) by L959 , L236;
L964: ( C267 . ( - C272 ) ) in ( C267 .: C270 ) by L963 , FUNCT_2:35;
thus L965: C271 in ( Ball (( D167 . C268 ) , C269) ) by L964 , L955 , L960 , L962;
end;
thus L966: thesis by L953 , TOPS_4:18;
