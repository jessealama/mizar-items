proof
let C218 being  compact non  vertical non  horizontal non  empty (Subset of ( TOP-REAL 2 ));
let R8 being (Element of ( NAT ));
set D87 = ( Gauge (C218 , R8) );
L1422: ( len D87 ) = ( width D87 ) by JORDAN8:def 1;
let C219 being (FinSequence of ( TOP-REAL 2 ));
assume that
L1423: C219 is_sequence_on D87
and
L1424: ( len C219 ) > 1;
L1425: (1 <= ( ( len C219 ) -' 1 ) & ( ( ( len C219 ) -' 1 ) + 1 ) = ( len C219 )) by L1424 , NAT_D:49 , XREAL_1:235;
let C220 , C221 being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume that
L1426: (( front_right_cell (C219 , ( ( len C219 ) -' 1 ) , D87) ) meets C218 & [ C220 , ( C221 + 1 ) ] in ( Indices D87 ) & ( C219 /. ( ( len C219 ) -' 1 ) ) = ( D87 * (C220 , ( C221 + 1 )) ))
and
L1427: [ C220 , C221 ] in ( Indices D87 )
and
L1428: ( C219 /. ( len C219 ) ) = ( D87 * (C220 , C221) );
L1429: C221 <= ( width D87 ) by L1427 , MATRIX_1:38;
L1430: 1 <= C220 by L1427 , MATRIX_1:38;
L1431:
now
assume L1432: ( C220 -' 1 ) < 1;
L1433: C220 <= 1 by L1432 , NAT_1:14 , NAT_D:36;
L1434: C220 = 1 by L1433 , L1430 , XXREAL_0:1;
L1435: ( cell (D87 , ( 1 -' 1 ) , ( C221 -' 1 )) ) meets C218 by L1434 , L1423 , L1426 , L1427 , L1428 , L1425 , GOBRD13:41;
L1436: ( cell (D87 , ( 0 ) , ( C221 -' 1 )) ) meets C218 by L1435 , XREAL_1:232;
thus L1437: contradiction by L1436 , L1422 , L1429 , JORDAN8:18 , NAT_D:44;
end;
L1438: C220 <= ( len D87 ) by L1427 , MATRIX_1:38;
L1439: ( C220 -' 1 ) <= ( len D87 ) by L1438 , NAT_D:44;
L1440: 1 <= C221 by L1427 , MATRIX_1:38;
thus L1441: thesis by L1440 , L1429 , L1439 , L1431 , MATRIX_1:36;
