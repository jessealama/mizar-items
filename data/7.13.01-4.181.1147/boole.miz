theorem
L1: (for B1 being set holds ( B1 \/ ( {} ) ) = B1)
proof
let C1 being set;
thus L2: ( C1 \/ ( {} ) ) c= C1
proof
let C2 being set;
assume L3: C2 in ( C1 \/ ( {} ) );
L4: (C2 in C1 or C2 in ( {} )) by L3 , XBOOLE_0:def 3;
thus L5: thesis by L4 , XBOOLE_0:def 1;
end;

let C3 being set;
assume L6: C3 in C1;
thus L7: thesis by L6 , XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
theorem
L8: (for B2 being set holds ( B2 /\ ( {} ) ) = ( {} ))
proof
let C4 being set;
thus L9: ( C4 /\ ( {} ) ) c= ( {} )
proof
let C5 being set;
assume L10: C5 in ( C4 /\ ( {} ) );
thus L11: thesis by L10 , XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;

let C6 being set;
assume L12: C6 in ( {} );
thus L13: thesis by L12 , XBOOLE_0:def 1;
end;
theorem
L14: (for B3 being set holds ( B3 \ ( {} ) ) = B3)
proof
let C7 being set;
thus L15: ( C7 \ ( {} ) ) c= C7
proof
let C8 being set;
assume L16: C8 in ( C7 \ ( {} ) );
thus L17: thesis by L16 , XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;

let C9 being set;
L18: (not C9 in ( {} )) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
assume L19: C9 in C7;
thus L20: thesis by L19 , L18 , XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
theorem
L21: (for B4 being set holds ( ( {} ) \ B4 ) = ( {} ))
proof
let C10 being set;
thus L22: ( ( {} ) \ C10 ) c= ( {} )
proof
let C11 being set;
assume L23: C11 in ( ( {} ) \ C10 );
thus L24: thesis by L23 , XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;

let C12 being set;
assume L25: C12 in ( {} );
thus L26: thesis by L25 , XBOOLE_0:def 1;
end;
theorem
L27: (for B5 being set holds ( B5 \+\ ( {} ) ) = B5)
proof
let C13 being set;
thus L28: ( C13 \+\ ( {} ) ) c= C13
proof
let C14 being set;
assume L29: C14 in ( C13 \+\ ( {} ) );
L30: (C14 in ( C13 \ ( {} ) ) or C14 in ( ( {} ) \ C13 )) by L29 , XBOOLE_0:def 3;
per cases  by L30 , XBOOLE_0:def 5;
suppose L31: (C14 in C13 & (not C14 in ( {} )));

thus L32: thesis by L31;
end;
suppose L33: (C14 in ( {} ) & (not C14 in C13));

thus L34: thesis by L33 , XBOOLE_0:def 1;
end;

let C15 being set;
L36: (not C15 in ( {} )) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
assume L37: C15 in C13;
L38: C15 in ( C13 \ ( {} ) ) by L37 , L36 , XBOOLE_0:def 5;
thus L39: thesis by L38 , XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
L40: (for R2 being set holds (R2 is  empty implies R2 = ( {} )))
proof
let R2 being set;
assume L41: (not (ex R1 being set st R1 in R2));
L42: (for R1 being set holds (R1 in ( {} ) iff R1 in R2)) by L41 , XBOOLE_0:def 1;
thus L43: thesis by L42 , TARSKI:1;
end;
theorem
L44: (for B6 being set holds (B6 is  empty implies B6 = ( {} ))) by L40;
theorem
L45: (for B7 , B8 being set holds (B7 in B8 implies B8 is non  empty)) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
theorem
L46: (for B9 , B10 being set holds ((B9 is  empty & B9 <> B10) implies B10 is non  empty))
proof
let C16 , C17 being set;
assume that
L47: C16 is  empty
and
L48: C16 <> C17;
L49: C16 = ( {} ) by L47 , L40;
thus L50: thesis by L49 , L48 , L40;
