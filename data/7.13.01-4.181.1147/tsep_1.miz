theorem
L1587: (for B326 being TopStruct holds ( B326 | ( [#] B326 ) ) = ( the TopStruct of B326 ))
proof
let C324 being TopStruct;
L1588: (( the TopStruct of C324 ) is  strict  strict  strict  strict (SubSpace of C324) & (the carrier of C324) = ( [#] ( the TopStruct of C324 ) )) by L12 , PRE_TOPC:10;
thus L1589: thesis by L1588 , PRE_TOPC:def 5;
