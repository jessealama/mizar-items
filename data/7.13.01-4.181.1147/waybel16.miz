theorem
L714: (for B176 being  complete  algebraic LATTICE holds (for B177 being (Element of B176) holds ((ex B178 being (Element of B176) st (B178 in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt B176 )) & B177 is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of B176) \ ( uparrow B178 ) ))) iff B177 is  completely-irreducible)))
proof
let C192 being  complete  algebraic LATTICE;
let C193 being (Element of C192);
thus L715: ((ex B179 being (Element of C192) st (B179 in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt C192 )) & C193 is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of C192) \ ( uparrow B179 ) ))) implies C193 is  completely-irreducible) by L445;
thus L716: (C193 is  completely-irreducible implies (ex B180 being (Element of C192) st (B180 in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt C192 )) & C193 is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of C192) \ ( uparrow B180 ) ))))
proof
defpred S3[ (Element of C192) ] means ($1 in ( uparrow C193 ) & (ex B181 being (Element of C192) st (B181 in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt C192 )) & $1 is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of C192) \ ( uparrow B181 ) ))));
reconsider D45 = { B182 where B182 is (Element of C192) : S3[ B182 ] } as (Subset of C192) from DOMAIN_1:sch 7;
assume L717: C193 is  completely-irreducible;
L718: C193 = ( inf D45 ) by L717 , L674;
L719: C193 in D45 by L718 , L717 , L654;
consider C194 being (Element of C192) such that L720: C194 = C193 and L721: C194 in ( uparrow C193 ) and L722: (ex B183 being (Element of C192) st (B183 in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt C192 )) & C194 is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of C192) \ ( uparrow B183 ) ))) by L719;
consider C195 being (Element of C192) such that L723: C195 in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt C192 )) and L724: C194 is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of C192) \ ( uparrow C195 ) ) by L722;
take C195;
thus L725: C195 in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt C192 )) by L723;
thus L726: thesis by L720 , L724;
