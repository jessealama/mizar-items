theorem
L1: (for B1 , B2 being set holds (B1 in B2 implies B1 is (Element of B2))) by SUBSET_1:def 1;
theorem
L2: (for B3 , B4 being set holds ((B3 is (Element of B4) & B4 is non  empty) implies B3 in B4)) by SUBSET_1:def 1;
theorem
L3: (for B5 , B6 being set holds (B5 is (Subset of B6) iff B5 c= B6))
proof
let C1 , C2 being set;
thus L4:now
assume L5: C1 is (Subset of C2);
L6: C1 in ( bool C2 ) by L5 , SUBSET_1:def 1;
thus L7: C1 c= C2 by L6 , ZFMISC_1:def 1;
end;
assume L8: C1 c= C2;
L9: C1 in ( bool C2 ) by L8 , ZFMISC_1:def 1;
thus L10: thesis by L9 , SUBSET_1:def 1;
end;
theorem
L11: (for B7 , B8 , B9 being set holds ((B7 in B8 & B8 is (Subset of B9)) implies B7 is (Element of B9)))
proof
let C3 , C4 , C5 being set;
assume that
L12: C3 in C4
and
L13: C4 is (Subset of C5);
L14: C4 c= C5 by L13 , L3;
L15: C3 in C5 by L14 , L12 , TARSKI:def 3;
thus L16: thesis by L15 , SUBSET_1:def 1;
end;
theorem
L17: (for B10 , B11 , B12 being set holds ((B10 in B11 & B11 is (Subset of B12)) implies B12 is non  empty));
