proof

given C242 being (Element of ( NAT )) such that
L878: ( iter (C241 , C242) ) is (Contraction of C240);

consider C243 being (Point of C240) such that L879: ( ( iter (C241 , C242) ) . C243 ) = C243 and L880: (for B233 being (Point of C240) holds (( ( iter (C241 , C242) ) . B233 ) = B233 implies C243 = B233)) by L878 , L758;

assume that

L883: (for B234 being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( ( iter (C241 , B234) ) . C244 ) = C244)
proof
defpred S11[ (Element of ( NAT )) ] means ( ( iter (C241 , $1) ) . C244 ) = C244;
L884:
now
let C245 being (Element of ( NAT ));

.= C244 by L882 , L885 , L886 , FUNCT_2:15;
thus L888: S11[ ( C245 + 1 ) ] by L887;

L889: ( ( iter (C241 , ( 0 )) ) . C244 ) = ( ( id (the carrier of C240) ) . C244 ) by FUNCT_7:84

L893: ( ( iter (C241 , C242) ) . C244 ) = C244 by L883;
