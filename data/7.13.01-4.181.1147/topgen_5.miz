proof
let R3 being set;
assume L2274: R3 in ( D320 .: ( C456 ` ) );
consider C463 being (Point of D315) such that L2275: C463 in ( C456 ` ) and L2276: R3 = ( D320 . C463 ) by L2274 , FUNCT_2:65;
L2277: C463 in ( y>=0-plane ) by L2249;
reconsider D321 = C463 as (Element of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) by L2277;
L2278: ( C456 ` ) c= ( C457 ` ) by L2255 , SUBSET_1:12;
L2279: C463 = |[ ( D321 `1 ) , ( D321 `2 ) ]| by EUCLID:53;
L2280: R3 = 1 by L2279 , L2278 , L2275 , L2271 , L2276;
thus L2281: thesis by L2280 , TARSKI:def 1;
