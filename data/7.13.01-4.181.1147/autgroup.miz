theorem
L458: (for R1 being  strict Group holds (R1 is  commutative  commutative  commutative  commutative Group implies (for B73 being (Element of ( InnAutGroup R1 )) holds B73 = ( 1_ ( InnAutGroup R1 ) ))))
proof
let R1 being  strict Group;
assume L459: R1 is  commutative  commutative  commutative  commutative Group;
let C80 being (Element of ( InnAutGroup R1 ));
L460: (the carrier of ( InnAutGroup R1 )) = ( InnAut R1 ) by L255;
consider C81 being (Element of ( InnAut R1 )) such that L461: C81 = C80 by L460;
L462: C81 is (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of R1) , (the carrier of R1)) )) by FUNCT_2:8;
consider R3 being (Element of R1) such that L463: (for R6 being (Element of R1) holds ( C81 . R6 ) = ( R6 |^ R3 )) by L462 , L135;
L464: (for R6 being (Element of R1) holds ( C81 . R6 ) = R6)
proof
let R6 being (Element of R1);
thus L465: ( C81 . R6 ) = ( R6 |^ R3 ) by L463
.= R6 by L459 , GROUP_3:29;
end;
L466: (for R6 being (Element of R1) holds ( C81 . R6 ) = ( ( id (the carrier of R1) ) . R6 ))
proof
let R6 being (Element of R1);
thus L467: ( C81 . R6 ) = R6 by L464
.= ( ( id (the carrier of R1) ) . R6 ) by FUNCT_1:18;
end;
L468: C81 = ( id (the carrier of R1) ) by L466 , FUNCT_2:63;
thus L469: thesis by L468 , L461 , L323;
