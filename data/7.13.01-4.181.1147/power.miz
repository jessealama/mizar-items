thus L861: ( 2 to_power 5 ) = ( 2 to_power ( 3 + 2 ) )
.= ( ( 2 to_power 3 ) * ( 2 to_power 2 ) ) by L358
.= 32 by L854 , L856;
end;
theorem
L862: ( 2 to_power 6 ) = 64
proof
thus L863: ( 2 to_power 6 ) = ( 2 to_power ( 3 + 3 ) )
.= ( ( 2 to_power 3 ) * ( 2 to_power 3 ) ) by L358
.= 64 by L856;
end;
