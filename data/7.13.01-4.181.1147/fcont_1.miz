theorem
L1505: (for B110 , B111 being  real number holds (B110 > ( 0 ) implies ( ( AffineMap (B110 , B111) ) .: [. ( 0 ) , 1 .] ) = [. B111 , ( B110 + B111 ) .]))
proof
let C110 , C111 being  real number;
assume that
L1506: C110 > ( 0 );
thus L1507: ( ( AffineMap (C110 , C111) ) .: [. ( 0 ) , 1 .] ) c= [. C111 , ( C110 + C111 ) .]
proof

let C112 being set;

L1516: C111 <= D88 by L1515 , L1506 , L1511 , L1514 , L1482;
thus L1517: thesis by L1516 , L1513 , XXREAL_1:1;
