theorem
L1108: (for B261 being ExtREAL_sequence holds (B261 is  convergent implies (( lim B261 ) = ( lim_inf B261 ) & ( lim B261 ) = ( lim_sup B261 ))))
proof
let C217 being ExtREAL_sequence;
set D72 = ( lim_inf C217 );
assume L1109: C217 is  convergent;
L1110: ( lim_inf C217 ) = ( lim_sup C217 ) by L1109 , L1012;
per cases  by XXREAL_0:14;
suppose L1111: D72 in ( REAL );

thus L1112: thesis by L1111 , L1110 , L994;

suppose L1113: D72 = ( +infty );
