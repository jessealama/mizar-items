theorem
L674: (for B182 being  complete non  empty Poset holds (for B183 being  extra-order (Relation of B182) holds (for B184 being  satisfying_SIC (strict_chain of B183) holds (for B185 , B186 being (Element of B182) holds ((B185 in B184 & B186 in B184 & B185 < B186) implies (ex B187 being (Element of B182) st (B187 in ( SupBelow (B183 , B184) ) & B185 < B187 & [ B187 , B186 ] in B183)))))))
proof
let C248 being  complete non  empty Poset;
let C249 being  extra-order (Relation of C248);
let C250 being  satisfying_SIC (strict_chain of C249);
let C251 , C252 being (Element of C248);
assume that
L675: C251 in C250
and
L676: C252 in C250
and
L677: C251 < C252;
consider C253 being (Element of C248) such that L678: C251 < C253 and L679: [ C253 , C252 ] in C249 and L680: C253 = ( sup ( SetBelow (C249 , C250 , C253) ) ) by L675 , L676 , L677 , L420;
take C253;
thus L681: thesis by L678 , L679 , L680 , L552;
