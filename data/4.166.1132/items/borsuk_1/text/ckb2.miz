definition
let X being non empty TopSpace;
let Y being non empty TopSpace;
let F being (Function of X,Y);
redefine attr F is  continuous
means
(for W being (Point of X) holds (for G being (a_neighborhood of ( F . W )) holds (ex H being (a_neighborhood of W) st ( F .: H ) c= G)));
compatibility
proof
A1: ( [#] Y ) <> ( {} );
thus (F is  continuous implies (for W being (Point of X) holds (for G being (a_neighborhood of ( F . W )) holds (ex H being (a_neighborhood of W) st ( F .: H ) c= G))))
proof
assume A2: F is  continuous;
let W being (Point of X);
let G being (a_neighborhood of ( F . W ));
( F . W ) in ( Int G ) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
then A3: W in ( F " ( Int G ) ) by FUNCT_2:38;
( F " ( Int G ) ) is  open by A1,A2,TOPS_2:43;
then W in ( Int ( F " ( Int G ) ) ) by A3,TOPS_1:23;
then reconsider H = ( F " ( Int G ) ) as (a_neighborhood of W) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
take H;
H c= ( F " G ) by RELAT_1:143,TOPS_1:16;
hence thesis by EQREL_1:46;
end;

assume A4: (for W being (Point of X) holds (for G being (a_neighborhood of ( F . W )) holds (ex H being (a_neighborhood of W) st ( F .: H ) c= G)));
now
let P1 being (Subset of Y);
assume that
A5: P1 is  open;
now
let x being set;
thus (x in ( F " P1 ) implies (ex P being (Subset of X) st ((P is  open & P c= ( F " P1 )) & x in P)))
proof
assume A6: x in ( F " P1 );
then reconsider W = x as (Point of X);
A7: ( Int P1 ) = P1 by A5,TOPS_1:23;
( F . W ) in P1 by A6,FUNCT_2:38;
then P1 is (a_neighborhood of ( F . W )) by A7,CONNSP_2:def 1;
then consider H being (a_neighborhood of W) such that A8: ( F .: H ) c= P1 by A4;
take ( Int H );
thus ( Int H ) is  open;
A9: ( Int H ) c= H by TOPS_1:16;
( dom F ) = (the carrier of X) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A10: H c= ( F " ( F .: H ) ) by FUNCT_1:76;
( F " ( F .: H ) ) c= ( F " P1 ) by A8,RELAT_1:143;
then H c= ( F " P1 ) by A10,XBOOLE_1:1;
hence ( Int H ) c= ( F " P1 ) by A9,XBOOLE_1:1;
thus thesis by CONNSP_2:def 1;
end;

thus ((ex P being (Subset of X) st ((P is  open & P c= ( F " P1 )) & x in P)) implies x in ( F " P1 ));
end;
hence ( F " P1 ) is  open by TOPS_1:25;
end;
hence thesis by A1,TOPS_2:43;
end;
