definition
let X being TopSpace;
let D being (a_partition of (the carrier of X));
func space D ->  strict TopSpace
means
:Def10: ((the carrier of it) = D & (the topology of it) = { A where A is (Subset of D): ( union A ) in (the topology of X) });
existence
proof
set t = { A where A is (Subset of D): ( union A ) in (the topology of X) };
t c= ( bool D )
proof
let e;
assume e in t;
then (ex A being (Subset of D) st (e = A & ( union A ) in (the topology of X)));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider t as (Subset-Family of D);
set T = TopStruct (# D,t #);
T is  TopSpace-like
proof
( union D ) = (the carrier of X) by EQREL_1:def 4;
then (D c= D & ( union D ) in (the topology of X)) by PRE_TOPC:def 1;
hence (the carrier of T) in (the topology of T);
thus (for a being (Subset-Family of T) holds (a c= (the topology of T) implies ( union a ) in (the topology of T)))
proof
let a being (Subset-Family of T);
A1: { ( union A ) where A is (Subset of T): A in a } c= ( bool (the carrier of X) )
proof
let e;
assume e in { ( union A ) where A is (Subset of T): A in a };
then consider A being (Subset of T) such that A2: e = ( union A ) and A in a;
e c= (the carrier of X)
proof
let u;
assume u in e;
then consider x being set such that A3: u in x and A4: x in A by A2,TARSKI:def 4;
x in (the carrier of T) by A4;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
assume A5: a c= (the topology of T);
{ ( union A ) where A is (Subset of T): A in a } c= (the topology of X)
proof
let e;
assume e in { ( union A ) where A is (Subset of T): A in a };
then consider A being (Subset of T) such that A6: e = ( union A ) and A7: A in a;
A in (the topology of T) by A5,A7;
then (ex B being (Subset of D) st (A = B & ( union B ) in (the topology of X)));
hence thesis by A6;
end;
then ( union { ( union A ) where A is (Subset of T): A in a } ) in (the topology of X) by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 1;
then ( union ( union a ) ) in (the topology of X) by EQREL_1:54;
hence thesis;
end;

let a being (Subset of T),b being (Subset of T);
assume that
A8: a in (the topology of T)
and
A9: b in (the topology of T);
consider B being (Subset of D) such that A10: b = B and A11: ( union B ) in (the topology of X) by A9;
consider A being (Subset of D) such that A12: a = A and A13: ( union A ) in (the topology of X) by A8;
( union ( A /\ B ) ) = ( ( union A ) /\ ( union B ) ) by EQREL_1:62;
then ( union ( A /\ B ) ) in (the topology of X) by A13,A11,PRE_TOPC:def 1;
hence thesis by A12,A10;
end;
then reconsider T as  strict TopSpace;
take T;
thus thesis;
end;
