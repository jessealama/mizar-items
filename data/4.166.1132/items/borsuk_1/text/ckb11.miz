theorem
Th45: (for X,Y being TopSpace holds (for B being (Subset of [: X,Y :]) holds (B is  open iff (ex A being (Subset-Family of [: X,Y :]) st (B = ( union A ) & (for e holds (e in A implies (ex X1 being (Subset of X) st (ex Y1 being (Subset of Y) st ((e = [: X1,Y1 :] & X1 is  open) & Y1 is  open))))))))))
proof
let X being TopSpace;
let Y being TopSpace;
let B being (Subset of [: X,Y :]);
A1: (the topology of [: X,Y :]) = { ( union A ) where A is (Subset-Family of [: X,Y :]): A c= { [: X1,Y1 :] where X1 is (Subset of X),Y1 is (Subset of Y): (X1 in (the topology of X) & Y1 in (the topology of Y)) } } by CKB9:def 1;
thus (B is  open implies (ex A being (Subset-Family of [: X,Y :]) st (B = ( union A ) & (for e holds (e in A implies (ex X1 being (Subset of X) st (ex Y1 being (Subset of Y) st ((e = [: X1,Y1 :] & X1 is  open) & Y1 is  open))))))))
proof
assume B in (the topology of [: X,Y :]);
then consider A being (Subset-Family of [: X,Y :]) such that A2: B = ( union A ) and A3: A c= { [: X1,Y1 :] where X1 is (Subset of X),Y1 is (Subset of Y): (X1 in (the topology of X) & Y1 in (the topology of Y)) } by A1;
take A;
thus B = ( union A ) by A2;
let e;
assume e in A;
then e in { [: X1,Y1 :] where X1 is (Subset of X),Y1 is (Subset of Y): (X1 in (the topology of X) & Y1 in (the topology of Y)) } by A3;
then consider X1 being (Subset of X),Y1 being (Subset of Y) such that A4: ((e = [: X1,Y1 :] & X1 in (the topology of X)) & Y1 in (the topology of Y));
reconsider Y1 as (Subset of Y);
reconsider X1 as (Subset of X);
take X1;
take Y1;
thus thesis by A4,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
end;

given A being (Subset-Family of [: X,Y :]) such that
A5: B = ( union A )
and
A6: (for e holds (e in A implies (ex X1 being (Subset of X) st (ex Y1 being (Subset of Y) st ((e = [: X1,Y1 :] & X1 is  open) & Y1 is  open)))));

A c= { [: X1,Y1 :] where X1 is (Subset of X),Y1 is (Subset of Y): (X1 in (the topology of X) & Y1 in (the topology of Y)) }
proof
let e;
assume e in A;
then consider X1 being (Subset of X),Y1 being (Subset of Y) such that A7: e = [: X1,Y1 :] and A8: (X1 is  open & Y1 is  open) by A6;
(X1 in (the topology of X) & Y1 in (the topology of Y)) by A8,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
hence thesis by A7;
end;
hence B in (the topology of [: X,Y :]) by A1,A5;
