theorem
(for I being  finite set holds (for F being  associative  Group-like (multMagma-Family of I) holds ( product F ) = ( sum F )))
proof
let I being  finite set;
let F being  associative  Group-like (multMagma-Family of I);
set GP = ( product F );
set S = ( sum F );
A1: (the carrier of S) = (the carrier of GP)
proof
reconsider g = ( 1_ GP ) as (Element of ( product ( Carrier F ) )) by CKB8:def 1;
thus (the carrier of S) c= (the carrier of GP) by GROUP_2:def 5;

proof

consider J being set such that A4: (for j being set holds (j in J iff (j in I & P[ j ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
J c= I
proof
let j being set;
assume j in J;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
then reconsider J as (Subset of I);

A6: ( dom ff ) = J by PARTFUN1:def 2;
A7:now

suppose A9: i in J;

hence ( f . i ) = ( ff . i ) by A5

consider G being  Group-like non  empty multMagma such that A11: G = ( F . i ) by A8,CKB11:def 1;
( f . i ) is (Element of G) by A8,A11,Lm1;
hence ( f . i ) = ( 1_ G ) by A4,A8,A10,A11

hence x = ( g +* ff ) by A3,A7,FUNCT_1:2;
let j being set;

then consider G being  Group-like non  empty multMagma,m being (Element of G) such that A14: G = ( F . j ) and A15: m = ( f . j ) and A16: m <> ( 1_ G ) by A4;
take G;
( ff . j ) = ( f . j ) by A5,A13;
hence thesis by A14,A15,A16;

hence thesis by CKB28:def 1;
