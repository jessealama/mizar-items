hence ( gf . i ) in ( CF . i ) by A99,A102,A103,FUNCT_4:13;

consider G being  Group-like non  empty multMagma such that A105: G = ( F . i ) by A101,CKB11:def 1;
( gf . i ) = ( g . i ) by A99,A104,FUNCT_4:11

( dom gf ) = ( ( dom g ) \/ ( dom f ) ) by FUNCT_4:def 1

(ex g being (Element of ( product ( Carrier F ) )) st (ex J being  finite (Subset of I) st (ex f being (ManySortedSet of J) st ((g = ( 1_ ( product F ) ) & $1 = ( g +* f )) & (for j being set holds (j in J implies (ex G being  Group-like non  empty multMagma st ((G = ( F . j ) & ( f . j ) in (the carrier of G)) & ( f . j ) <> ( 1_ G )))))))));
let A being  strict (Subgroup of ( product F ));
let B being  strict (Subgroup of ( product F ));
assume that
A106: (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of A) iff P[ x ]))
and
A107: (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of B) iff P[ x ]));
(the carrier of A) = (the carrier of B) from XBOOLE_0:sch 2(A106,A107);
hence thesis by GROUP_2:59;
