reserve Y for TopStruct;
theorem
(for Y being non  empty TopStruct holds (for Y0 being non  proper (SubSpace of Y) holds ( the TopStruct of Y0 ) = ( the TopStruct of Y )))
proof
let Y being non  empty TopStruct;
let Y0 being non  proper (SubSpace of Y);
A1: (ex A being (Subset of Y) st (A = (the carrier of Y0) & A is non  proper)) by CKB23:def 1;
now
let D being set;
assume A2: D in (the topology of Y);
then reconsider E = D as (Subset of Y);
reconsider C = E as (Subset of Y0) by A1,SUBSET_1:def 6;
now
take E;
thus (E in (the topology of Y) & C = ( E /\ ( [#] Y0 ) )) by A2,XBOOLE_1:28;
end;
hence D in (the topology of Y0) by PRE_TOPC:def 4;
end;
then A3: (the topology of Y) c= (the topology of Y0) by TARSKI:def 3;
A4: (the carrier of Y0) = (the carrier of Y) by A1,SUBSET_1:def 6;
now
let D being set;
assume A5: D in (the topology of Y0);
then reconsider C = D as (Subset of Y0);
(ex E being (Subset of Y) st (E in (the topology of Y) & C = ( E /\ ( [#] Y0 ) ))) by A5,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
hence D in (the topology of Y) by A4,XBOOLE_1:28;
end;
then (the topology of Y0) c= (the topology of Y) by TARSKI:def 3;
then (the topology of Y0) = (the topology of Y) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by A1,SUBSET_1:def 6;
