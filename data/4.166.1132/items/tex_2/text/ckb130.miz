theorem
Th65: (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A is  discrete implies (ex M being (Subset of X) st (A c= M & M is  maximal_discrete))))
proof
let A being (Subset of X);
set D = ( ( [#] X ) \ ( Cl A ) );
set F = { ( Cl { d } ) where d is (Point of X): d in D };
now
let C being set;
assume C in F;
then (ex a being (Point of X) st (C = ( Cl { a } ) & a in D));
hence C in ( bool (the carrier of X) );
end;
then reconsider F as (Subset-Family of X) by TARSKI:def 3;
assume A1: A is  discrete;
defpred X[ set,set ]
 means
($2 in D & $2 in $1);
A2: D = ( ( Cl A ) ` );
then D is  closed by TDLAT_3:21;
then A3: D = ( Cl D ) by PRE_TOPC:22;
A c= ( Cl A ) by PRE_TOPC:18;
then A misses D by A2,SUBSET_1:24;
then A4: ( A /\ D ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
reconsider F as (Subset-Family of X);
A5: (for S being (Subset of X) holds (S in F implies (ex x being (Point of X) st X[ S,x ])))
proof
let S being (Subset of X);
assume S in F;
then consider d being (Point of X) such that A6: S = ( Cl { d } ) and A7: d in D;
take d;
{ d } c= ( Cl { d } ) by PRE_TOPC:18;
hence thesis by A6,A7,ZFMISC_1:31;
end;
consider f being (Function of F,(the carrier of X)) such that A8: (for S being (Subset of X) holds (S in F implies X[ S,( f . S ) ])) from CKB118:sch 1(A5);
set M = ( A \/ ( f .: F ) );
now
let x being set;
assume x in ( f .: F );
then (ex S being set st ((S in F & S in F) & x = ( f . S ))) by FUNCT_2:64;
hence x in D by A8;
end;
then A9: ( f .: F ) c= D by TARSKI:def 3;
D misses ( Cl A ) by A2,SUBSET_1:24;
then A10: ( Cl A ) misses ( f .: F ) by A9,XBOOLE_1:63;
thus (ex M being (Subset of X) st (A c= M & M is  maximal_discrete))
proof
take M;
thus A11: A c= M by XBOOLE_1:7;
(for x being (Point of X) holds (ex a being (Point of X) st (a in M & ( M /\ ( Cl { x } ) ) = { a })))
proof
let x being (Point of X);
A12: ( [#] X ) = ( ( Cl A ) \/ D ) by XBOOLE_1:45;
now
per cases  by A12,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A13: x in ( Cl A );

now
consider a being (Point of X) such that A14: a in A and A15: ( A /\ ( Cl { x } ) ) = { a } by A1,A13,CKB125:1;
take a;
thus a in M by A11,A14;
{ x } c= ( Cl A ) by A13,ZFMISC_1:31;
then ( f .: F ) misses ( Cl { x } ) by A10,TOPS_1:5,XBOOLE_1:63;
then ( ( f .: F ) /\ ( Cl { x } ) ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then ( M /\ ( Cl { x } ) ) = ( ( A /\ ( Cl { x } ) ) \/ ( {} ) ) by XBOOLE_1:23;
hence ( M /\ ( Cl { x } ) ) = { a } by A15;

hence thesis;

suppose A16: x in D;

then A17: ( Cl { x } ) in F;
now
reconsider a = ( f . ( Cl { x } ) ) as (Point of X) by A17,FUNCT_2:5;

A18: ( f .: F ) c= M by XBOOLE_1:7;
now
let y being set;

A20: z in ( Cl { x } ) by A19,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A21: z in M by A19,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
{ x } c= D by A16,ZFMISC_1:31;
then ( Cl { x } ) c= D by A3,PRE_TOPC:19;
then (not z in A) by A4,A20,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then z in ( f .: F ) by A21,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then consider C being set such that A22: C in F and C in F and A23: z = ( f . C ) by FUNCT_2:64;
reconsider C as (Subset of X) by A22;
consider w being (Point of X) such that A24: C = ( Cl { w } ) and w in D by A22;
( Cl { z } ) = ( Cl { x } ) by A20,CKB120:1;
then ( f . ( Cl { w } ) ) = a by A8,A22,A23,A24,CKB120:1;
hence y in { a } by A23,A24,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
then A25: ( M /\ ( Cl { x } ) ) c= { a } by TARSKI:def 3;
A26: a in ( f .: F ) by A17,FUNCT_2:35;
hence a in M by A18;
a in ( Cl { x } ) by A8,A17;
then A27: { a } c= ( Cl { x } ) by ZFMISC_1:31;
{ a } c= M by A18,A26,ZFMISC_1:31;
then { a } c= ( M /\ ( Cl { x } ) ) by A27,XBOOLE_1:19;
hence ( M /\ ( Cl { x } ) ) = { a } by A25,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
end;
hence thesis;

hence M is  maximal_discrete by CKB129:1;
