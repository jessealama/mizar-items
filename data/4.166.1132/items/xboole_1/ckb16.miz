theorem
Th16: ( ( X /\ Y ) /\ Z ) = ( X /\ ( Y /\ Z ) )
proof
thus ( ( X /\ Y ) /\ Z ) c= ( X /\ ( Y /\ Z ) )
proof
let x;
assume A1: x in ( ( X /\ Y ) /\ Z );
then A2: x in Z by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A3: x in ( X /\ Y ) by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A4: x in X by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
x in Y by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then x in ( Y /\ Z ) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;

let x;
assume A5: x in ( X /\ ( Y /\ Z ) );
then A6: x in ( Y /\ Z ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A7: x in Y by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A8: x in Z by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
x in X by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then x in ( X /\ Y ) by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
