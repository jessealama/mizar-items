theorem
(for F being (Projections_family of a,I) holds ((a is_a_product_wrt F & (for x holds (x in I implies ( cod ( F /. x ) ) is  terminal))) implies a is  terminal))
proof
let F being (Projections_family of a,I);
assume that
A1: a is_a_product_wrt F
and
A2: (for x holds (x in I implies ( cod ( F /. x ) ) is  terminal));
now
thus (I = ( {} ) implies a is  terminal) by A1,CKB66:1;
let b;
deffunc f(set) = ( term (b,( cod ( F /. $1 ) )) );
consider F9 being (Function of I,(the carrier' of C)) such that A3: (for x holds (x in I implies ( F9 /. x ) = f(x))) from CKB1:sch 1;
now
let x;
assume A4: x in I;
then A5: ( cod ( F /. x ) ) is  terminal by A2;
thus ( ( doms F9 ) /. x ) = ( dom ( F9 /. x ) ) by A4,CKB7:def 1
.= ( dom ( term (b,( cod ( F /. x ) )) ) ) by A3,A4
.= b by A5,CKB48:1
.= ( ( I --> b ) /. x ) by A4,CKB5:1;
end;
then ( doms F9 ) = ( I --> b ) by CKB2:1;
then reconsider F9 as (Projections_family of b,I) by CKB55:def 1;
now
let x;
assume A6: x in I;
then A7: ( cod ( F /. x ) ) is  terminal by A2;
thus ( ( cods F ) /. x ) = ( cod ( F /. x ) ) by A6,CKB8:def 1
.= ( cod ( term (b,( cod ( F /. x ) )) ) ) by A7,CKB48:1
.= ( cod ( F9 /. x ) ) by A3,A6
.= ( ( cods F9 ) /. x ) by A6,CKB8:def 1;
end;
then ( cods F ) = ( cods F9 ) by CKB2:1;
then consider h such that A8: h in ( Hom (b,a) ) and A9: (for k holds (k in ( Hom (b,a) ) implies ((for x holds (x in I implies ( ( F /. x ) * k ) = ( F9 /. x ))) iff h = k))) by A1,CKB63:def 1;
thus ( Hom (b,a) ) <> ( {} ) by A8;
reconsider h as (Morphism of b,a) by A8,CAT_1:def 4;
take h;
let g being (Morphism of b,a);
now
thus g in ( Hom (b,a) ) by A8,CAT_1:def 4;
let x;
set c = ( cod ( F /. x ) );
A10: ( cod g ) = a by A8,CAT_1:5;
assume A11: x in I;
then c is  terminal by A2;
then consider f being (Morphism of b,c) such that A12: (for f9 being (Morphism of b,c) holds f = f9) by CAT_1:def 12;
A13: ( dom ( F /. x ) ) = a by A11,CKB56:1;
then A14: ( cod ( ( F /. x ) * g ) ) = c by A10,CAT_1:17;
( dom g ) = b by A8,CAT_1:5;
then ( dom ( ( F /. x ) * g ) ) = b by A10,A13,CAT_1:17;
then ( ( F /. x ) * g ) in ( Hom (b,c) ) by A14;
then A15: ( ( F /. x ) * g ) is (Morphism of b,c) by CAT_1:def 4;
( F9 /. x ) = ( term (b,c) ) by A3,A11;
hence ( F9 /. x ) = f by A12
.= ( ( F /. x ) * g ) by A12,A15;
end;
hence h = g by A9;
end;
hence thesis by CAT_1:def 12;
end;
