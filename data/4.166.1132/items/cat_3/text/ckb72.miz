theorem
((( Hom (c,a) ) <> ( {} ) & ( Hom (c,b) ) <> ( {} )) implies (for p1 being (Morphism of c,a) holds (for p2 being (Morphism of c,b) holds (c is_a_product_wrt p1,p2 iff (for d holds ((( Hom (d,a) ) <> ( {} ) & ( Hom (d,b) ) <> ( {} )) implies (( Hom (d,c) ) <> ( {} ) & (for f being (Morphism of d,a) holds (for g being (Morphism of d,b) holds (ex h being (Morphism of d,c) st (for k being (Morphism of d,c) holds ((( p1 * k ) = f & ( p2 * k ) = g) iff h = k))))))))))))
proof
assume that
A1: ( Hom (c,a) ) <> ( {} )
and
A2: ( Hom (c,b) ) <> ( {} );
let p1 being (Morphism of c,a);
let p2 being (Morphism of c,b);
thus (c is_a_product_wrt p1,p2 implies (for d holds ((( Hom (d,a) ) <> ( {} ) & ( Hom (d,b) ) <> ( {} )) implies (( Hom (d,c) ) <> ( {} ) & (for f being (Morphism of d,a) holds (for g being (Morphism of d,b) holds (ex h being (Morphism of d,c) st (for k being (Morphism of d,c) holds ((( p1 * k ) = f & ( p2 * k ) = g) iff h = k)))))))))
proof
assume that
( dom p1 ) = c
and
( dom p2 ) = c
and
A3: (for d holds (for f holds (for g holds ((f in ( Hom (d,( cod p1 )) ) & g in ( Hom (d,( cod p2 )) )) implies (ex h st (h in ( Hom (d,c) ) & (for k holds (k in ( Hom (d,c) ) implies ((( p1 * k ) = f & ( p2 * k ) = g) iff h = k)))))))));
let d;
assume that
A4: ( Hom (d,a) ) <> ( {} )
and
A5: ( Hom (d,b) ) <> ( {} );
set f = the (Morphism of d,a);
set g = the (Morphism of d,b);
A6: ( cod p2 ) = b by A2,CAT_1:5;
then A7: g in ( Hom (d,( cod p2 )) ) by A5,CAT_1:def 4;
A8: ( cod p1 ) = a by A1,CAT_1:5;
then f in ( Hom (d,( cod p1 )) ) by A4,CAT_1:def 4;
then A9: (ex h st (h in ( Hom (d,c) ) & (for k holds (k in ( Hom (d,c) ) implies ((( p1 * k ) = f & ( p2 * k ) = g) iff h = k))))) by A3,A7;
hence ( Hom (d,c) ) <> ( {} );
let f being (Morphism of d,a);
let g being (Morphism of d,b);
A10: g in ( Hom (d,( cod p2 )) ) by A5,A6,CAT_1:def 4;
f in ( Hom (d,( cod p1 )) ) by A4,A8,CAT_1:def 4;
then consider h such that A11: h in ( Hom (d,c) ) and A12: (for k holds (k in ( Hom (d,c) ) implies ((( p1 * k ) = f & ( p2 * k ) = g) iff h = k))) by A3,A10;
reconsider h as (Morphism of d,c) by A11,CAT_1:def 4;
take h;
let k being (Morphism of d,c);
A13: k in ( Hom (d,c) ) by A9,CAT_1:def 4;
(( p1 * k ) = ( p1 * (k qua (Morphism of C)) ) & ( p2 * k ) = ( p2 * (k qua (Morphism of C)) )) by A1,A2,A9,CAT_1:def 10;
hence thesis by A12,A13;

assume A14: (for d holds ((( Hom (d,a) ) <> ( {} ) & ( Hom (d,b) ) <> ( {} )) implies (( Hom (d,c) ) <> ( {} ) & (for f being (Morphism of d,a) holds (for g being (Morphism of d,b) holds (ex h being (Morphism of d,c) st (for k being (Morphism of d,c) holds ((( p1 * k ) = f & ( p2 * k ) = g) iff h = k))))))));
thus (( dom p1 ) = c & ( dom p2 ) = c) by A1,A2,CAT_1:5;
let d;
let f;
let g;
assume that
A15: f in ( Hom (d,( cod p1 )) )

A17: ( Hom (d,a) ) <> ( {} ) by A1,A15,CAT_1:5;
A18: ( cod p1 ) = a by A1,CAT_1:5;
then A19: f is (Morphism of d,a) by A15,CAT_1:def 4;
A20: ( cod p2 ) = b by A2,CAT_1:5;
then g is (Morphism of d,b) by A16,CAT_1:def 4;
then consider h being (Morphism of d,c) such that A21: (for k being (Morphism of d,c) holds ((( p1 * k ) = f & ( p2 * k ) = g) iff h = k)) by A14,A16,A20,A19,A17;
reconsider h9 = h as (Morphism of C);
take h9;
A22: ( Hom (d,c) ) <> ( {} ) by A14,A15,A16,A18,A20;
hence h9 in ( Hom (d,c) ) by CAT_1:def 4;
let k;

(( p1 * k ) = ( p1 * k9 ) & ( p2 * k ) = ( p2 * k9 )) by A1,A2,A22,CAT_1:def 10;
hence thesis by A21;
