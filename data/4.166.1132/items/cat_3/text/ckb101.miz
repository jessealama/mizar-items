theorem
((( Hom (a,c) ) <> ( {} ) & ( Hom (b,c) ) <> ( {} )) implies (for i1 being (Morphism of a,c) holds (for i2 being (Morphism of b,c) holds (c is_a_coproduct_wrt i1,i2 iff (for d holds ((( Hom (a,d) ) <> ( {} ) & ( Hom (b,d) ) <> ( {} )) implies (( Hom (c,d) ) <> ( {} ) & (for f being (Morphism of a,d) holds (for g being (Morphism of b,d) holds (ex h being (Morphism of c,d) st (for k being (Morphism of c,d) holds ((( k * i1 ) = f & ( k * i2 ) = g) iff h = k))))))))))))
proof
assume that
A1: ( Hom (a,c) ) <> ( {} )
and
A2: ( Hom (b,c) ) <> ( {} );
let i1 being (Morphism of a,c);
let i2 being (Morphism of b,c);
thus (c is_a_coproduct_wrt i1,i2 implies (for d holds ((( Hom (a,d) ) <> ( {} ) & ( Hom (b,d) ) <> ( {} )) implies (( Hom (c,d) ) <> ( {} ) & (for f being (Morphism of a,d) holds (for g being (Morphism of b,d) holds (ex h being (Morphism of c,d) st (for k being (Morphism of c,d) holds ((( k * i1 ) = f & ( k * i2 ) = g) iff h = k)))))))))
proof
assume that
( cod i1 ) = c
and
( cod i2 ) = c
and
A3: (for d holds (for f holds (for g holds ((f in ( Hom (( dom i1 ),d) ) & g in ( Hom (( dom i2 ),d) )) implies (ex h st (h in ( Hom (c,d) ) & (for k holds (k in ( Hom (c,d) ) implies ((( k * i1 ) = f & ( k * i2 ) = g) iff h = k)))))))));
let d;
assume that
A4: ( Hom (a,d) ) <> ( {} )
and
A5: ( Hom (b,d) ) <> ( {} );
set f = the (Morphism of a,d);
set g = the (Morphism of b,d);
A6: ( dom i2 ) = b by A2,CAT_1:5;
then A7: g in ( Hom (( dom i2 ),d) ) by A5,CAT_1:def 4;
A8: ( dom i1 ) = a by A1,CAT_1:5;
then f in ( Hom (( dom i1 ),d) ) by A4,CAT_1:def 4;
then A9: (ex h st (h in ( Hom (c,d) ) & (for k holds (k in ( Hom (c,d) ) implies ((( k * i1 ) = f & ( k * i2 ) = g) iff h = k))))) by A3,A7;
hence ( Hom (c,d) ) <> ( {} );
let f being (Morphism of a,d);
let g being (Morphism of b,d);
A10: g in ( Hom (( dom i2 ),d) ) by A5,A6,CAT_1:def 4;
f in ( Hom (( dom i1 ),d) ) by A4,A8,CAT_1:def 4;
then consider h such that A11: h in ( Hom (c,d) ) and A12: (for k holds (k in ( Hom (c,d) ) implies ((( k * i1 ) = f & ( k * i2 ) = g) iff h = k))) by A3,A10;
reconsider h as (Morphism of c,d) by A11,CAT_1:def 4;
take h;
let k being (Morphism of c,d);
A13: k in ( Hom (c,d) ) by A9,CAT_1:def 4;
(( k * i1 ) = ( k * (i1 qua (Morphism of C)) ) & ( k * i2 ) = ( k * (i2 qua (Morphism of C)) )) by A1,A2,A9,CAT_1:def 10;
hence thesis by A12,A13;

assume A14: (for d holds ((( Hom (a,d) ) <> ( {} ) & ( Hom (b,d) ) <> ( {} )) implies (( Hom (c,d) ) <> ( {} ) & (for f being (Morphism of a,d) holds (for g being (Morphism of b,d) holds (ex h being (Morphism of c,d) st (for k being (Morphism of c,d) holds ((( k * i1 ) = f & ( k * i2 ) = g) iff h = k))))))));
thus (( cod i1 ) = c & ( cod i2 ) = c) by A1,A2,CAT_1:5;
let d;
let f;
let g;
assume that
A15: f in ( Hom (( dom i1 ),d) )

A17: ( Hom (a,d) ) <> ( {} ) by A1,A15,CAT_1:5;
A18: ( dom i1 ) = a by A1,CAT_1:5;
then A19: f is (Morphism of a,d) by A15,CAT_1:def 4;
A20: ( dom i2 ) = b by A2,CAT_1:5;
then g is (Morphism of b,d) by A16,CAT_1:def 4;
then consider h being (Morphism of c,d) such that A21: (for k being (Morphism of c,d) holds ((( k * i1 ) = f & ( k * i2 ) = g) iff h = k)) by A14,A16,A20,A19,A17;
reconsider h9 = h as (Morphism of C);
take h9;
A22: ( Hom (c,d) ) <> ( {} ) by A14,A15,A16,A18,A20;
hence h9 in ( Hom (c,d) ) by CAT_1:def 4;
let k;

then reconsider k9 = k as (Morphism of c,d) by CAT_1:def 4;
(( k * i1 ) = ( k9 * i1 ) & ( k * i2 ) = ( k9 * i2 )) by A1,A2,A22,CAT_1:def 10;
hence thesis by A21;
