theorem
Th53: (for F being (Projections_family of c,I) holds (for F9 being (Projections_family of d,I) holds (((c is_a_product_wrt F & d is_a_product_wrt F9) & ( cods F ) = ( cods F9 )) implies c,d are_isomorphic )))
proof
let F being (Projections_family of c,I);
let F9 being (Projections_family of d,I);
assume that
A1: c is_a_product_wrt F
and
A2: d is_a_product_wrt F9
and
A3: ( cods F ) = ( cods F9 );
( cods F9 ) = ( cods F9 );
then consider gf being (Morphism of C) such that gf in ( Hom (d,d) ) and A4: (for k holds (k in ( Hom (d,d) ) implies ((for x holds (x in I implies ( ( F9 /. x ) * k ) = ( F9 /. x ))) iff gf = k))) by A2,CKB63:def 1;
consider f such that A5: f in ( Hom (d,c) ) and A6: (for k holds (k in ( Hom (d,c) ) implies ((for x holds (x in I implies ( ( F /. x ) * k ) = ( F9 /. x ))) iff f = k))) by A1,A3,CKB63:def 1;
( cods F ) = ( cods F );
then consider fg being (Morphism of C) such that fg in ( Hom (c,c) ) and A7: (for k holds (k in ( Hom (c,c) ) implies ((for x holds (x in I implies ( ( F /. x ) * k ) = ( F /. x ))) iff fg = k))) by A1,CKB63:def 1;
consider g such that A8: g in ( Hom (c,d) ) and A9: (for k holds (k in ( Hom (c,d) ) implies ((for x holds (x in I implies ( ( F9 /. x ) * k ) = ( F /. x ))) iff g = k))) by A2,A3,CKB63:def 1;
thus ( Hom (c,d) ) <> ( {} ) by A8;
reconsider g as (Morphism of c,d) by A8,CAT_1:def 4;
A10: ( cod g ) = d by A8,CAT_1:1;
A11:now
set k = ( id c );
thus k in ( Hom (c,c) ) by CAT_1:26;
let x;
assume x in I;
then ( dom ( F /. x ) ) = c by CKB56:1;
hence ( ( F /. x ) * k ) = ( F /. x ) by CAT_1:22;
end;
A12:now
set k = ( id d );
thus k in ( Hom (d,d) ) by CAT_1:26;
let x;
assume x in I;
then ( dom ( F9 /. x ) ) = d by CKB56:1;
hence ( ( F9 /. x ) * k ) = ( F9 /. x ) by CAT_1:22;
end;
take g;
take f;
A13: ( dom g ) = c by A8,CAT_1:1;
hence (( dom f ) = ( cod g ) & ( cod f ) = ( dom g )) by A5,A10,CAT_1:1;
A14: ( cod f ) = c by A5,CAT_1:1;
A15: ( dom f ) = d by A5,CAT_1:1;
now
(( dom ( g * f ) ) = d & ( cod ( g * f ) ) = d) by A15,A10,A14,A13,CAT_1:17;
hence ( g * f ) in ( Hom (d,d) );
let x;
assume A16: x in I;
then ( dom ( F9 /. x ) ) = d by CKB56:1;
hence ( ( F9 /. x ) * ( g * f ) ) = ( ( ( F9 /. x ) * g ) * f ) by A10,A14,A13,CAT_1:18
.= ( ( F /. x ) * f ) by A8,A9,A16
.= ( F9 /. x ) by A5,A6,A16;
end;
hence ( g * f ) = gf by A4
.= ( id ( cod g ) ) by A10,A4,A12;
now
(( dom ( f * g ) ) = c & ( cod ( f * g ) ) = c) by A15,A10,A14,A13,CAT_1:17;
hence ( f * g ) in ( Hom (c,c) );
let x;
assume A17: x in I;
then ( dom ( F /. x ) ) = c by CKB56:1;
hence ( ( F /. x ) * ( f * g ) ) = ( ( ( F /. x ) * f ) * g ) by A15,A10,A14,CAT_1:18
.= ( ( F9 /. x ) * g ) by A5,A6,A17
.= ( F /. x ) by A8,A9,A17;
end;
hence ( f * g ) = fg by A7
.= ( id ( dom g ) ) by A13,A11,A7;
end;
