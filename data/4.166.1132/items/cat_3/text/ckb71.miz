theorem
Th59: (x1 <> x2 implies (c is_a_product_wrt p1,p2 iff c is_a_product_wrt ( (x1,x2) --> (p1,p2) )))
proof
set F = ( (x1,x2) --> (p1,p2) );
set I = { x1,x2 };
assume A1: x1 <> x2;
thus (c is_a_product_wrt p1,p2 implies c is_a_product_wrt F)
proof
assume A2: c is_a_product_wrt p1,p2;
then (( dom p1 ) = c & ( dom p2 ) = c) by CKB70:def 1;
hence F is (Projections_family of c,I) by CKB59:1;
let b;
let F9 being (Projections_family of b,I);
assume that
A3: ( cods F ) = ( cods F9 );
set f = ( F9 /. x1 );
set g = ( F9 /. x2 );
A4: x1 in I by TARSKI:def 2;
then ( ( cods F ) /. x1 ) = ( cod ( F /. x1 ) ) by CKB8:def 1;
then ( cod f ) = ( cod ( F /. x1 ) ) by A3,A4,CKB8:def 1;
then A5: ( cod f ) = ( cod p1 ) by A1,CKB6:1;
A6: x2 in I by TARSKI:def 2;
then ( ( cods F ) /. x2 ) = ( cod ( F /. x2 ) ) by CKB8:def 1;
then ( cod g ) = ( cod ( F /. x2 ) ) by A3,A6,CKB8:def 1;
then A7: ( cod g ) = ( cod p2 ) by A1,CKB6:1;
( dom g ) = b by A6,CKB56:1;
then A8: g in ( Hom (b,( cod p2 )) ) by A7;
( dom f ) = b by A4,CKB56:1;
then f in ( Hom (b,( cod p1 )) ) by A5;
then consider h such that A9: h in ( Hom (b,c) ) and A10: (for k holds (k in ( Hom (b,c) ) implies ((( p1 * k ) = f & ( p2 * k ) = g) iff h = k))) by A2,A8,CKB70:def 1;
take h;
thus h in ( Hom (b,c) ) by A9;
let k;
assume that
A11: k in ( Hom (b,c) );
thus ((for x holds (x in I implies ( ( F /. x ) * k ) = ( F9 /. x ))) implies h = k)
proof
assume A12: (for x holds (x in I implies ( ( F /. x ) * k ) = ( F9 /. x )));
then ( ( F /. x2 ) * k ) = g by A6;
then A13: ( p2 * k ) = g by A1,CKB6:1;
( ( F /. x1 ) * k ) = f by A4,A12;
then ( p1 * k ) = f by A1,CKB6:1;
hence thesis by A10,A11,A13;
end;

assume h = k;
then A14: (( p1 * k ) = f & ( p2 * k ) = g) by A10,A11;
let x;
assume x in I;
then (x = x1 or x = x2) by TARSKI:def 2;
hence thesis by A1,A14,CKB6:1;
end;

assume A15: c is_a_product_wrt F;
then A16: F is (Projections_family of c,I) by CKB63:def 1;
x2 in I by TARSKI:def 2;
then A17: ( dom ( F /. x2 ) ) = c by A16,CKB56:1;
x1 in I by TARSKI:def 2;
then ( dom ( F /. x1 ) ) = c by A16,CKB56:1;
hence (( dom p1 ) = c & ( dom p2 ) = c) by A1,A17,CKB6:1;
let d;
let f;
let g;
assume that
A18: f in ( Hom (d,( cod p1 )) )
and
A19: g in ( Hom (d,( cod p2 )) );
(( dom f ) = d & ( dom g ) = d) by A18,A19,CAT_1:1;
then reconsider F9 = ( (x1,x2) --> (f,g) ) as (Projections_family of d,I) by CKB59:1;
( cods F ) = ( (x1,x2) --> (( cod p1 ),( cod p2 )) ) by CKB12:1
.= ( (x1,x2) --> (( cod f ),( cod p2 )) ) by A18,CAT_1:1
.= ( (x1,x2) --> (( cod f ),( cod g )) ) by A19,CAT_1:1
.= ( cods F9 ) by CKB12:1;
then consider h such that A20: h in ( Hom (d,c) ) and A21: (for k holds (k in ( Hom (d,c) ) implies ((for x holds (x in I implies ( ( F /. x ) * k ) = ( F9 /. x ))) iff h = k))) by A15,CKB63:def 1;
take h;
thus h in ( Hom (d,c) ) by A20;
let k;
assume that
A22: k in ( Hom (d,c) );
thus ((( p1 * k ) = f & ( p2 * k ) = g) implies h = k)
proof
assume A23: (( p1 * k ) = f & ( p2 * k ) = g);
now
let x;
assume x in I;
then (x = x1 or x = x2) by TARSKI:def 2;
then ((( F /. x ) = p1 & ( F9 /. x ) = f) or (( F /. x ) = p2 & ( F9 /. x ) = g)) by A1,CKB6:1;
hence ( ( F /. x ) * k ) = ( F9 /. x ) by A23;
end;
hence thesis by A21,A22;
end;

assume A24: h = k;
x2 in I by TARSKI:def 2;
then ( ( F /. x2 ) * k ) = ( F9 /. x2 ) by A21,A22,A24;
then A25: ( ( F /. x2 ) * k ) = g by A1,CKB6:1;
x1 in I by TARSKI:def 2;
then ( ( F /. x1 ) * k ) = ( F9 /. x1 ) by A21,A22,A24;
then ( ( F /. x1 ) * k ) = f by A1,CKB6:1;
hence thesis by A1,A25,CKB6:1;
