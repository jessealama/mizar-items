proof
let a being (Element of L),b being (Element of L);
set X = ( D1 "\/" D2 );
assume that
A1: a in X
and
A2: b in X;
consider x being (Element of L),y being (Element of L) such that A3: a = ( x "\/" y ) and A4: x in D1 and A5: y in D2 by A1;
consider s being (Element of L),t being (Element of L) such that A6: b = ( s "\/" t ) and A7: s in D1 and A8: t in D2 by A2;
consider z2 being (Element of L) such that A9: z2 in D2 and A10: (y <= z2 & t <= z2) by A5,A8,WAYBEL_0:def 1;
consider z1 being (Element of L) such that A11: z1 in D1 and A12: (x <= z1 & s <= z1) by A4,A7,WAYBEL_0:def 1;
take z = ( z1 "\/" z2 );
thus z in X by A11,A9;
thus thesis by A3,A6,A12,A10,YELLOW_3:3;
