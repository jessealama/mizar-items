theorem
(for L being  with_suprema Poset holds (for x,y being (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) )) holds (for X,Y being (Subset of L) holds ((x = X & y = Y) implies ( x "\/" y ) = ( downarrow ( X "\/" Y ) )))))
proof
let L being  with_suprema Poset;
let x being (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) )),y being (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) ));
let X being (Subset of L),Y being (Subset of L);
assume that
A1: x = X
and
A2: y = Y;
reconsider X1 = X,Y1 = Y as non empty  directed (Subset of L) by A1,A2,YELLOW_2:41;
reconsider d = ( downarrow ( X1 "\/" Y1 ) ) as (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) )) by YELLOW_2:41;
Y c= d by CKB39:1;
then A3: y <= d by A2,YELLOW_1:3;
X c= d by CKB39:1;
then x <= d by A1,YELLOW_1:3;
then (d <= d & ( x "\/" y ) <= ( d "\/" d )) by A3,YELLOW_3:3;
then ( x "\/" y ) <= d by YELLOW_0:24;
hence ( x "\/" y ) c= ( downarrow ( X "\/" Y ) ) by YELLOW_1:3;
consider Z being (Subset of L) such that A4: Z = { z where z is (Element of L): ((z in x or z in y) or (ex a,b being (Element of L) st ((a in x & b in y) & z = ( a "\/" b )))) } and  ex_sup_of { x,y },( InclPoset ( Ids L ) ) and A5: ( x "\/" y ) = ( downarrow Z ) by YELLOW_2:44;
( X "\/" Y ) c= Z
proof
let q being set;
assume q in ( X "\/" Y );
then (ex s,t being (Element of L) st ((q = ( s "\/" t ) & s in X) & t in Y));
hence thesis by A1,A2,A4;
end;
hence thesis by A5,YELLOW_3:6;
