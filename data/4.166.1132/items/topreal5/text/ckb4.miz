theorem
Th9: (for A being (Subset of ( R^1 )) holds (for a holds (((not a in A) & (ex b st (ex d st (((b in A & d in A) & b < a) & a < d)))) implies (not A is  connected))))
proof
let A being (Subset of ( R^1 ));
let a;
assume that
A1: (not a in A)
and
A2: (ex b st (ex d st (((b in A & d in A) & b < a) & a < d)));
consider b,d such that A3: b in A and A4: d in A and A5: b < a and A6: a < d by A2;
set B2 = { s: s > a };
set B1 = { r: r < a };
A7: A c= ( B1 \/ B2 )
proof
let x;
assume A8: x in A;
then reconsider r = x as Real by METRIC_1:def 13,TOPMETR:12,TOPMETR:def 6;
(r < a or a < r) by A1,A8,XXREAL_0:1;
then (r in B1 or r in B2);
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
B2 c= ( REAL )
proof
let x;
assume x in B2;
then (ex r st (r = x & r > a));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider C2 = B2 as (Subset of ( R^1 )) by METRIC_1:def 13,TOPMETR:12,TOPMETR:def 6;
B1 c= ( REAL )
proof
let x;
assume x in B1;
then (ex r st (r = x & r < a));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider C1 = B1 as (Subset of ( R^1 )) by METRIC_1:def 13,TOPMETR:12,TOPMETR:def 6;
A9:now
assume B1 meets B2;
then consider x being set such that A10: x in ( B1 /\ B2 ) by XBOOLE_0:4;
x in B2 by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A11: (ex r2 st (r2 = x & r2 > a));
x in B1 by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then (ex r1 st (r1 = x & r1 < a));
hence contradiction by A11;
end;
reconsider r1 = d as (Element of ( REAL )) by XREAL_0:def 1;
r1 in B2 by A6;
then d in ( B2 /\ A ) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A12: B2 meets A by XBOOLE_0:4;
reconsider r = b as (Element of ( REAL )) by XREAL_0:def 1;
r in B1 by A5;
then b in ( B1 /\ A ) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A13: B1 meets A by XBOOLE_0:4;
(C1 is  open & C2 is  open) by JORDAN2B:24,JORDAN2B:25;
hence thesis by A9,A13,A12,A7,CKB2:1;
