theorem
Lm1: (AFP is  Desarguesian iff (for o holds (for a holds (for a9 holds (for p holds (for p9 holds (for q holds (for q9 holds ((((((( LIN o,a,a9 &  LIN o,p,p9) &  LIN o,q,q9) & (not  LIN o,a,p)) & (not  LIN o,a,q)) & a,p // a9,p9) & a,q // a9,q9) implies p,q // p9,q9)))))))))
proof
thus (AFP is  Desarguesian implies (for o holds (for a holds (for a9 holds (for p holds (for p9 holds (for q holds (for q9 holds ((((((( LIN o,a,a9 &  LIN o,p,p9) &  LIN o,q,q9) & (not  LIN o,a,p)) & (not  LIN o,a,q)) & a,p // a9,p9) & a,q // a9,q9) implies p,q // p9,q9)))))))))

set C = ( Line (o,q) );
A9: a in A by AFF_1:15;

then A11: A is  being_line by AFF_1:def 3;
