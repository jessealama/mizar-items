theorem
Lm19: ((a,b // K & (not a in K)) implies (for x holds (ex y st ((x in K & x = y) or ((not x in K) & (ex p st (ex p9 st ((((p in K & p9 in K) & p,a // p9,x) & p,b // p9,y) & x,y // K))))))))
proof
assume that
A1: a,b // K
and
A2: (not a in K);
A3: (not b in K) by A1,A2,AFF_1:35;
A4: K is  being_line by A1,AFF_1:26;
let x;
consider p,q such that A5: p in K and q in K and p <> q by A1,AFF_1:19,AFF_1:26;
A6: p <> b by A1,A2,A5,AFF_1:35;
now
set B9 = ( Line (p,b) );
set A = ( Line (p,a) );
assume A7: (not x in K);
A8: a in A by AFF_1:15;
A is  being_line by A2,A5,AFF_1:def 3;
then consider C such that A9: x in C and A10: A // C by AFF_1:49;
A11: C is  being_line by A10,AFF_1:36;
A12: p in A by AFF_1:15;
then (not A // K) by A2,A5,A8,AFF_1:45;
then (not C // K) by A10,AFF_1:44;
then consider p9 such that A13: p9 in C and A14: p9 in K by A4,A11,AFF_1:58;
B9 is  being_line by A6,AFF_1:def 3;
then consider D such that A15: p9 in D and A16: B9 // D by AFF_1:49;
A17: b in B9 by AFF_1:15;
K is  being_line by A1,AFF_1:26;
then consider M such that A18: x in M and A19: K // M by AFF_1:49;
A20: M is  being_line by A19,AFF_1:36;
A21: p in B9 by AFF_1:15;
then A22: (not B9 // K) by A5,A3,A17,AFF_1:45;
A23: (not D // M)
proof
assume D // M;
then B9 // M by A16,AFF_1:44;
hence contradiction by A22,A19,AFF_1:44;
end;
D is  being_line by A16,AFF_1:36;
then consider y such that A24: y in D and A25: y in M by A20,A23,AFF_1:58;
A26: p,b // p9,y by A21,A17,A15,A16,A24,AFF_1:39;
A27: x,y // K by A18,A19,A25,AFF_1:40;
p,a // p9,x by A12,A8,A9,A10,A13,AFF_1:39;
hence thesis by A5,A7,A14,A27,A26;
end;
hence thesis;
