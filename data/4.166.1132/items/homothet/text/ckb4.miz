theorem
Lm4: (AFP is  Moufangian implies (for K holds (for A holds (for C holds (for p holds (for q holds (for a holds (for a9 holds (for b holds (for b9 holds ((((((((((((K // A & K // C) & K <> A) & K <> C) & p in K) & q in K) & a in A) & a9 in A) & b in C) & b9 in C) & p,a // q,a9) & p,b // q,b9) implies a,b // a9,b9)))))))))))
proof
assume AFP is  Moufangian;
then A1: AFP is  translational by AFF_2:14;
let K;
let A;
let C;
let p;
let q;
let a;
let a9;
let b;
let b9;
assume that
A2: K // A
and
A3: K // C
and
A4: K <> A
and
A5: K <> C
and
A6: p in K
and
A7: q in K
and
A8: a in A
and
A9: a9 in A
and
A10: b in C
and
A11: b9 in C
and
A12: p,a // q,a9
and
A13: p,b // q,b9;
A14: A is  being_line by A2,AFF_1:36;
A15: C is  being_line by A3,AFF_1:36;
K is  being_line by A2,AFF_1:36;
hence thesis by A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8,A9,A10,A11,A12,A13,A1,A14,A15,AFF_2:def 11;
