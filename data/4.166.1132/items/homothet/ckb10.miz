theorem
Lm8: (for o holds (for a holds (for b holds (for x holds ((o <> a &  LIN o,a,b) implies (ex y st ((((not  LIN o,a,x) &  LIN o,x,y) & a,x // b,y) or ( LIN o,a,x & (ex p st (ex p9 st (((((not  LIN o,a,p) &  LIN o,p,p9) & a,p // b,p9) & p,x // p9,y) &  LIN o,a,y)))))))))))
proof
let o;
let a;
let b;
let x;
assume that
A1: o <> a
and
A2:  LIN o,a,b;

consider p such that A4: (not  LIN o,a,p) by A1,AFF_1:13;
set K = ( Line (o,p) );
o <> p by A4,AFF_1:7;
then A5: K is  being_line by AFF_1:def 3;
set A = ( Line (a,p) );
a <> p by A4,AFF_1:7;
then A is  being_line by AFF_1:def 3;
then consider B9 such that A6: b in B9 and A7: A // B9 by AFF_1:49;
A8: B9 is  being_line by A7,AFF_1:36;

A10: p in K by AFF_1:15;
A11: p in A by AFF_1:15;
A12: o in K by AFF_1:15;
(not B9 // K)
proof
assume B9 // K;
then A // K by A7,AFF_1:44;
then A = K by A10,A11,AFF_1:45;
hence contradiction by A4,A12,A10,A9,A5,AFF_1:21;

A27: (not D // M)
proof
assume D // M;
then C // M by A21,AFF_1:44;
then C = M by A26,A25,AFF_1:45;
hence contradiction by A4,A16,A24,A22,A19,AFF_1:21;
end;
D is  being_line by A21,AFF_1:36;

hence thesis by A18,A4,A23,A15,A30;

now
o,a // o,b by A2,AFF_1:def 1;
then a,o // o,b by AFF_1:4;
then consider y such that A31: x,o // o,y and A32: x,a // b,y by A1,DIRAF:40;
o,x // o,y by A31,AFF_1:4;

hence thesis by A34,A33;
