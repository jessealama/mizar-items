Th22: (for G being Group holds (G is  nilpotent iff (ex F being (FinSequence of ( the_normal_subgroups_of G )) st (((( len F ) > ( 0 ) & ( F . 1 ) = ( (Omega). G )) & ( F . ( len F ) ) = ( (1). G )) & (for i holds ((i in ( dom F ) & ( i + 1 ) in ( dom F )) implies (for G1,G2 being  strict  normal (Subgroup of G) holds ((G1 = ( F . i ) & G2 = ( F .

proof
let G being Group;

assume G is  nilpotent;
then consider R being (FinSequence of ( the_normal_subgroups_of G )) such that A2: (((( len R ) > ( 0 ) & ( R . 1 ) = ( (Omega). G )) & ( R . ( len R ) ) = ( (1).

[. G1,( (Omega). G ) .] is  strict  strict (Subgroup of G2)
proof
now
let N being  strict  normal (Subgroup of G);

then ( G1 ./. ( (G1,N) `*` ) ) is (Subgroup of ( center ( G ./. N ) )) by A2,A4,A5;
hence [. G1,( (Omega). G ) .] is  strict  strict (Subgroup of G2) by A7,CKB27:1;
