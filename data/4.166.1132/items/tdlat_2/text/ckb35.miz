theorem
Th33: ( Cl ( Int ( Cl F ) ) ) = { A where A is (Subset of T): (ex B being (Subset of T) st (A = ( Cl ( Int ( Cl B ) ) ) & B in F)) }
proof
set P = { A where A is (Subset of T): (ex B being (Subset of T) st (A = ( Cl ( Int ( Cl B ) ) ) & B in F)) };
now
let C being set;
assume C in P;
then (ex A being (Subset of T) st (C = A & (ex B being (Subset of T) st (A = ( Cl ( Int ( Cl B ) ) ) & B in F))));
hence C in ( bool (the carrier of T) );
end;
then reconsider P as (Subset-Family of T) by TARSKI:def 3;
reconsider P as (Subset-Family of T);
(for X being set holds (X in ( Cl ( Int ( Cl F ) ) ) iff X in P))
proof

( Cl B ) in ( Cl F ) by A4,PCOMPS_1:def 2;
