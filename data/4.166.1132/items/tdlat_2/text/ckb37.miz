reserve T for non empty TopSpace;
reserve F for (Subset-Family of T);
theorem
( Cl ( Int ( Cl ( Int F ) ) ) ) = ( Cl ( Int F ) )
proof
set H = { A where A is (Subset of T): (ex B being (Subset of T) st (A = ( Int ( Cl ( Int B ) ) ) & B in F)) };
( Int ( Cl ( Int F ) ) ) = H by CKB36:1;
then reconsider H as (Subset-Family of T);
A1: ( Cl ( Int ( Cl ( Int F ) ) ) ) = ( Cl H ) by CKB36:1;
A2: ( Cl ( Int F ) ) = { A where A is (Subset of T): (ex B being (Subset of T) st (A = ( Cl ( Int B ) ) & B in F)) } by CKB33:1;
(for X being set holds (X in ( Cl ( Int ( Cl ( Int F ) ) ) ) iff X in ( Cl ( Int F ) )))
proof
let X being set;

assume A4: X in ( Cl ( Int F ) );
then reconsider C = X as (Subset of T);
(ex D being (Subset of T) st (D = C & (ex B being (Subset of T) st (D = ( Cl ( Int B ) ) & B in F)))) by A2,A4;
then consider B being (Subset of T) such that A5: C = ( Cl ( Int B ) ) and A6: B in F;
( Int B ) in ( Int F ) by A6,CKB17:def 1;
then ( Cl ( Int B ) ) in ( Cl ( Int F ) ) by PCOMPS_1:def 2;
then A7: ( Int ( Cl ( Int B ) ) ) in ( Int ( Cl ( Int F ) ) ) by CKB17:def 1;
C = ( Cl ( Int ( Cl ( Int B ) ) ) ) by A5,TOPS_1:26;
hence X in ( Cl ( Int ( Cl ( Int F ) ) ) ) by A7,PCOMPS_1:def 2;
end;
now
assume A8: X in ( Cl ( Int ( Cl ( Int F ) ) ) );

(ex S being (Subset of T) st (S = B & (ex R being (Subset of T) st (S = ( Int ( Cl ( Int R ) ) ) & R in F)))) by A10;
then consider D being (Subset of T) such that A11: B = ( Int ( Cl ( Int D ) ) ) and A12: D in F;
A13: ( Int D ) in ( Int F ) by A12,CKB17:def 1;
C = ( Cl ( Int D ) ) by A9,A11,TOPS_1:26;
hence X in ( Cl ( Int F ) ) by A13,PCOMPS_1:def 2;
