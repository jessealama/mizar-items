( {} ) ) = [ o,(the carrier of S) ] implies (ex p being  DTree-yielding FinSequence st (( len p ) = ( len ( the_arity_of o ) ) & (for i being Nat holds (i in ( dom p ) implies ( p . i ) in ( (the Sorts of ( FreeMSA X )) .

proof
let S being non void non empty ManySortedSign;
let X being  non-empty (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of S));
let v being (Vertex of S);
let o being (OperSymbol of S);
let e being (Element of ( (the Sorts of ( FreeMSA X )) . v ));
assume that
A1: ( e . ( {} ) ) = [ o,(the carrier of S) ];
(the carrier of S) in { (the carrier of S) } by TARSKI:def 1;
then [ o,(the carrier of S) ] in [: (the carrier' of S),{ (the carrier of S) } :] by ZFMISC_1:87;
then reconsider nt = [ o,(the carrier of S) ] as (NonTerminal of ( DTConMSA X )) by MSAFREE:6;
( FreeMSA X ) = MSAlgebra (# ( FreeSort X ),( FreeOper X ) #) by MSAFREE:def 14;
then ( (the Sorts of ( FreeMSA X )) . v ) = ( FreeSort (X,v) ) by MSAFREE:def 11;
then e in ( FreeSort (X,v) );
then e in { a where a is (Element of ( TS ( DTConMSA X ) )): ((ex x being set st (x in ( X . v ) & a = ( root-tree [ x,v ] ))) or (ex o being (OperSymbol of S) st ([ o,(the carrier of S) ] = ( a . ( {} ) ) & ( the_result_sort_of o ) = v))) } by MSAFREE:def 10;
then consider a being (Element of ( TS ( DTConMSA X ) )) such that A2: a = e and A3: ((ex x being set st (x in ( X . v ) & a = ( root-tree [ x,v ] ))) or (ex o being (OperSymbol of S) st ([ o,(the carrier of S) ] = ( a . ( {} ) ) & ( the_result_sort_of o ) = v)));
consider x being set such that A4: ((x in ( X . v ) & a = ( root-tree [ x,v ] )) or (ex o being (OperSymbol of S) st ([ o,(the carrier of S) ] = ( a . ( {} ) ) & ( the_result_sort_of o ) = v))) by A3;
consider p being (FinSequence of ( TS ( DTConMSA X ) )) such that A5: a = ( nt -tree p ) and nt ==> ( roots p ) by A1,A2,DTCONSTR:10;
now
assume a = ( root-tree [ x,v ] );
then A6: ( a . ( {} ) ) = [ x,v ] by TREES_4:3;
A7: (for X being set holds (not X in X));
( a . ( {} ) ) = [ o,(the carrier of S) ] by A5,TREES_4:def 4;
then (the carrier of S) = v by A6,ZFMISC_1:27;
hence contradiction by A7;
end;
then consider o9 being (OperSymbol of S) such that A8: [ o9,(the carrier of S) ] = ( a . ( {} ) ) and A9: ( the_result_sort_of o9 ) = v by A4;
A10: o = o9 by A1,A2,A8,ZFMISC_1:27;
then A11: ( len p ) = ( len ( the_arity_of o ) ) by A2,A5,A9,CKB32:1;
then ( dom p ) = ( Seg ( len ( the_arity_of o ) ) ) by FINSEQ_1:def 3
.= ( dom ( the_arity_of o ) ) by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
then (for i being Nat holds (i in ( dom p ) implies ( p . i ) in ( (the Sorts of ( FreeMSA X )) . ( ( the_arity_of o ) . i ) ))) by A2,A5,A9,A10,CKB33:1;
hence thesis by A11;
