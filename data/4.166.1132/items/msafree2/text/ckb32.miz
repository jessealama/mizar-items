theorem
Th13: (for S being non void non empty ManySortedSign holds (for X being  non-empty (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of S)) holds (for o being (OperSymbol of S) holds (for p being  DTree-yielding FinSequence holds (( [ o,(the carrier of S) ] -tree p ) in ( (the Sorts of ( FreeMSA X )) . ( the_result_sort_of o ) ) implies ( len p ) = ( len ( the_arity_of o ) ))))))
proof
let S being non void non empty ManySortedSign;
let X being  non-empty (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of S));
let o being (OperSymbol of S);
let p being  DTree-yielding FinSequence;
set s = ( the_result_sort_of o );
assume A1: ( [ o,(the carrier of S) ] -tree p ) in ( (the Sorts of ( FreeMSA X )) . ( the_result_sort_of o ) );
( FreeMSA X ) = MSAlgebra (# ( FreeSort X ),( FreeOper X ) #) by MSAFREE:def 14;
then ( [ o,(the carrier of S) ] -tree p ) in ( FreeSort (X,s) ) by A1,MSAFREE:def 11;

then [ o,(the carrier of S) ] in [: (the carrier' of S),{ (the carrier of S) } :] by ZFMISC_1:87;
then reconsider nt = [ o,(the carrier of S) ] as (NonTerminal of ( DTConMSA X )) by MSAFREE:6;
reconsider O = ( [: (the carrier' of S),{ (the carrier of S) } :] \/ ( Union ( coprod X ) ) ) as non empty set;
reconsider R = ( REL X ) as (Relation of O,( O * ));
A3: ( DTConMSA X ) = DTConstrStr (# O,R #) by MSAFREE:def 8;
then reconsider TSDT = ( TS ( DTConMSA X ) ) as (Subset of ( FinTrees O ));
reconsider c = nt as (Element of O) by A3;
(for x being set holds (x in TSDT implies x is (DecoratedTree of O)));
then reconsider TSDT as (DTree-set of O) by TREES_3:def 6;
consider a being (Element of ( TS ( DTConMSA X ) )) such that A4: a = ( [ o,(the carrier of S) ] -tree p ) and ((ex x being set st (x in ( X . s ) & a = ( root-tree [ x,s ] ))) or (ex o being (OperSymbol of S) st ([ o,(the carrier of S) ] = ( a . ( {} ) ) & ( the_result_sort_of o ) = s))) by A2;
( a . ( {} ) ) = [ o,(the carrier of S) ] by A4,TREES_4:def 4;
then consider ts being (FinSequence of ( TS ( DTConMSA X ) )) such that A5: a = ( nt -tree ts ) and A6: nt ==> ( roots ts ) by DTCONSTR:10;
reconsider ts9 = ts as (FinSequence of TSDT);
reconsider b = ( roots ts9 ) as (FinSequence of O);
reconsider b as (Element of ( O * )) by FINSEQ_1:def 11;
[ c,b ] in R by A6,A3,LANG1:def 1;
then A7: ( len ( roots ts ) ) = ( len ( the_arity_of o ) ) by MSAFREE:def 7;
reconsider ts as  DTree-yielding FinSequence;
A8: ( dom ( roots ts ) ) = ( dom ts ) by TREES_3:def 18;
ts = p by A4,A5,TREES_4:15;
