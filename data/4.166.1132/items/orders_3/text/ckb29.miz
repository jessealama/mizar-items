reserve a for set;
definition
let X being set;
func Carr X -> set
means
:Def7: (a in it iff (ex s being 1-sorted st (s in X & a = (the carrier of s))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(ex s being 1-sorted st (s = $1 & $2 = (the carrier of s)));
A1: (for x,y,z being set holds ((P[ x,y ] & P[ x,z ]) implies y = z));
consider CX being set such that A2: (for x being set holds (x in CX iff (ex y being set st (y in X & P[ y,x ])))) from TARSKI:sch 1(A1);
take CX;
let x being set;
(x in CX iff (ex s being 1-sorted st (s in X & x = (the carrier of s))))
proof
thus (x in CX implies (ex s being 1-sorted st (s in X & x = (the carrier of s))))
proof
assume x in CX;
then consider y being set such that A3: y in X and A4: (ex s being 1-sorted st (s = y & x = (the carrier of s))) by A2;
consider s being 1-sorted such that A5: s = y and x = (the carrier of s) by A4;
take s;
thus thesis by A3,A4,A5;
end;

given s being 1-sorted such that
A6: (s in X & x = (the carrier of s));

thus thesis by A2,A6;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let C1 being set,C2 being set;
assume that
A7: (a in C1 iff (ex s being 1-sorted st (s in X & a = (the carrier of s))))
and
A8: (a in C2 iff (ex s being 1-sorted st (s in X & a = (the carrier of s))));
(a in C1 iff a in C2)
proof
thus (a in C1 implies a in C2)
proof
assume a in C1;
then (ex s being 1-sorted st (s in X & a = (the carrier of s))) by A7;
hence thesis by A8;
end;

thus (a in C2 implies a in C1)
proof
assume a in C2;
then (ex s being 1-sorted st (s in X & a = (the carrier of s))) by A8;
hence thesis by A7;
end;

end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
