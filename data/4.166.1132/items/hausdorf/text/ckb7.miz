theorem
Th8: (for M being non empty MetrSpace holds (for p being (Point of M) holds (for A being (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M )) holds (p in ( Cl A ) iff (for r being  real number holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex q being (Point of M) st (q in A & ( dist (p,q) ) < r))))))))
proof
let M being non empty MetrSpace;
let p being (Point of M);
let A being (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M ));
hereby
assume A1: p in ( Cl A );
let r being  real number;
assume r > ( 0 );
then ( Ball (p,r) ) meets A by A1,GOBOARD6:92;
then consider x being set such that A2: x in ( Ball (p,r) ) and A3: x in A by XBOOLE_0:3;
reconsider q = x as (Point of M) by A2;
take q;
thus q in A by A3;
thus ( dist (p,q) ) < r by A2,METRIC_1:11;
end;
assume A4: (for r being  real number holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex q being (Point of M) st (q in A & ( dist (p,q) ) < r))));
(for r being  real number holds (r > ( 0 ) implies ( Ball (p,r) ) meets A))
proof
let r being  real number;
assume r > ( 0 );
then consider q being (Point of M) such that A5: q in A and A6: ( dist (p,q) ) < r by A4;
q in ( Ball (p,r) ) by A6,METRIC_1:11;
hence thesis by A5,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
hence thesis by GOBOARD6:92;
