theorem
Th9: (for M being non empty MetrSpace holds (for P being non empty (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M )) holds (for x being (Point of M) holds (( ( dist_min P ) . x ) = ( 0 ) iff (for r being  real number holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex p being (Point of M) st (p in P & ( dist (x,p) ) < r))))))))
proof
let M being non empty MetrSpace;
let P being non empty (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M ));
let x being (Point of M);
reconsider X = ( ( dist x ) .: P ) as non empty (Subset of ( REAL )) by TOPMETR:17;
hereby
assume A1: ( ( dist_min P ) . x ) = ( 0 );
let r being  real number;
assume A2: r > ( 0 );
assume A3: (for p being (Point of M) holds (p in P implies ( dist (x,p) ) >= r));
(for p being  real number holds (p in X implies p >= r))
proof
let p being  real number;
assume p in X;
then consider y being set such that A4: y in ( dom ( dist x ) ) and A5: y in P and A6: p = ( ( dist x ) . y ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
reconsider z = y as (Point of M) by A4,TOPMETR:12;
( dist (x,z) ) >= r by A3,A5;
hence thesis by A6,WEIERSTR:def 4;
end;
then A7: ( lower_bound X ) >= r by SEQ_4:43;
( lower_bound ( ( dist x ) .: P ) ) = ( lower_bound ( [#] ( ( dist x ) .: P ) ) ) by WEIERSTR:def 3
.= ( lower_bound X ) by WEIERSTR:def 1;
hence contradiction by A1,A2,A7,WEIERSTR:def 6;
end;
A8: (for p being  real number holds (p in X implies p >= ( 0 )))
proof
let p being  real number;
assume p in X;
then consider y being set such that A9: y in ( dom ( dist x ) ) and y in P and A10: p = ( ( dist x ) . y ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
reconsider z = y as (Point of M) by A9,TOPMETR:12;
( dist (x,z) ) >= ( 0 ) by METRIC_1:5;
hence thesis by A10,WEIERSTR:def 4;
end;
assume A11: (for r being  real number holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex p being (Point of M) st (p in P & ( dist (x,p) ) < r))));
A12: (for q being  real number holds ((for p being  real number holds (p in X implies p >= q)) implies ( 0 ) >= q))
proof
let q being  real number;
assume A13: (for z being  real number holds (z in X implies z >= q));
assume ( 0 ) < q;
then consider p being (Point of M) such that A14: p in P and A15: ( dist (x,p) ) < q by A11;
set z = ( ( dist x ) . p );
p in (the carrier of ( TopSpaceMetr M )) by A14;
then p in ( dom ( dist x ) ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A16: z in X by A14,FUNCT_1:def 6;
( ( dist x ) . p ) < q by A15,WEIERSTR:def 4;
hence thesis by A13,A16;
end;
( lower_bound ( ( dist x ) .: P ) ) = ( lower_bound ( [#] ( ( dist x ) .: P ) ) ) by WEIERSTR:def 3
.= ( lower_bound X ) by WEIERSTR:def 1;
then ( lower_bound ( ( dist x ) .: P ) ) = ( 0 ) by A8,A12,SEQ_4:44;
hence thesis by WEIERSTR:def 6;
end;
