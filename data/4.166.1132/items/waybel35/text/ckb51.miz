theorem
Th25: (for L being non empty  reflexive  transitive RelStr holds (for R being  auxiliary(i)  auxiliary(ii) (Relation of L) holds (for C being (strict_chain of R) holds ((for c being (Element of L) holds  ex_sup_of ( SetBelow (R,C,c) ),L) implies ( SupBelow (R,C) ) is (strict_chain of R)))))
proof
let L being non empty  reflexive  transitive RelStr;
let R being  auxiliary(i)  auxiliary(ii) (Relation of L);
let C being (strict_chain of R);
assume A1: (for c being (Element of L) holds  ex_sup_of ( SetBelow (R,C,c) ),L);
thus ( SupBelow (R,C) ) is (strict_chain of R)
proof
let a being set,b being set;
assume A2: a in ( SupBelow (R,C) );
then A3: a = ( sup ( SetBelow (R,C,a) ) ) by CKB49:def 1;
reconsider a as (Element of L) by A2;
A4: a <= a;
A5:  ex_sup_of ( SetBelow (R,C,a) ),L by A1;
assume A6: b in ( SupBelow (R,C) );
then A7: b = ( sup ( SetBelow (R,C,b) ) ) by CKB49:def 1;
reconsider b as (Element of L) by A6;
A8: b <= b;
A9:  ex_sup_of ( SetBelow (R,C,b) ),L by A1;
per cases ;
suppose a = b;

hence thesis;
end;
suppose A10: a <> b;

((for x being (Element of L) holds (x in C implies ([ x,a ] in R iff [ x,b ] in R))) implies a = b)
proof
assume A11: (for x being (Element of L) holds (x in C implies ([ x,a ] in R iff [ x,b ] in R)));
( SetBelow (R,C,a) ) = ( SetBelow (R,C,b) )
proof
thus ( SetBelow (R,C,a) ) c= ( SetBelow (R,C,b) )
proof
let x being set;
assume A12: x in ( SetBelow (R,C,a) );
then reconsider x as (Element of L);
A13: x in C by A12,CKB40:1;
[ x,a ] in R by A12,CKB40:1;
then [ x,b ] in R by A13,A11;
hence thesis by A13,CKB40:1;
end;

let x being set;
assume A14: x in ( SetBelow (R,C,b) );
then reconsider x as (Element of L);
A15: x in C by A14,CKB40:1;
[ x,b ] in R by A14,CKB40:1;
then [ x,a ] in R by A15,A11;
hence thesis by A15,CKB40:1;
end;
hence thesis by A2,A7,CKB49:def 1;
end;
then consider x being (Element of L) such that A16: x in C and A17: (([ x,a ] in R & (not [ x,b ] in R)) or ((not [ x,a ] in R) & [ x,b ] in R)) by A10;
A18: x <= x;
thus thesis
proof
per cases  by A17;
suppose that A19: [ x,a ] in R
and
A20: (not [ x,b ] in R);
( SetBelow (R,C,b) ) is_<=_than x
proof
let y being (Element of L);
assume A21: y in ( SetBelow (R,C,b) );
then [ y,b ] in R by CKB40:1;
then A22: y <= b by WAYBEL_4:def 3;
y in C by A21,CKB40:1;
then (([ y,x ] in R or x = y) or [ x,y ] in R) by A16,CKB14:def 1;
hence y <= x by A18,A20,A22,WAYBEL_4:def 3,WAYBEL_4:def 4;
end;
then b <= x by A7,A9,YELLOW_0:def 9;
hence thesis by A4,A19,WAYBEL_4:def 4;
end;
suppose that A23: (not [ x,a ] in R)
and
A24: [ x,b ] in R;
( SetBelow (R,C,a) ) is_<=_than x
proof
let y being (Element of L);
assume A25: y in ( SetBelow (R,C,a) );
then [ y,a ] in R by CKB40:1;
then A26: y <= a by WAYBEL_4:def 3;
y in C by A25,CKB40:1;
then (([ y,x ] in R or x = y) or [ x,y ] in R) by A16,CKB14:def 1;
hence y <= x by A18,A23,A26,WAYBEL_4:def 3,WAYBEL_4:def 4;
end;
then a <= x by A3,A5,YELLOW_0:def 9;
hence thesis by A8,A24,WAYBEL_4:def 4;
