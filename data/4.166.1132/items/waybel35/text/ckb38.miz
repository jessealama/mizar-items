theorem
(for L being  lower-bounded  with_suprema Poset holds (for R being  auxiliary(i)  auxiliary(ii) (Relation of L) holds (for C being (strict_chain of R) holds ((C is  maximal & R is  satisfying_SI) implies R satisfies_SIC_on C))))
proof
let L being  lower-bounded  with_suprema Poset;
let R being  auxiliary(i)  auxiliary(ii) (Relation of L);
let C being (strict_chain of R);
assume that
A1: C is  maximal
and
A2: R is  satisfying_SI;
let x being (Element of L),z being (Element of L);
assume that
A3: x in C
and
A4: z in C
and
A5: [ x,z ] in R
and
A6: x <> z;
consider y being (Element of L) such that A7: [ x,y ] in R and A8: [ y,z ] in R and A9: x <> y by A2,A5,A6,WAYBEL_4:def 20;
A10: y <= z by A8,WAYBEL_4:def 3;
assume A11: (not thesis);
A12: x <= y by A7,WAYBEL_4:def 3;
A13: ( C \/ { y } ) is (strict_chain of R)
proof
let a being set,b being set;
assume that
A14: a in ( C \/ { y } )
and
A15: b in ( C \/ { y } );
per cases  by A14,A15,CKB1:1;
suppose (a in C & b in C);

hence thesis by CKB14:def 1;
end;
suppose that A16: a in C
and
A17: b = y;
now
reconsider a as (Element of L) by A16;
A18: a <= a;
per cases  by A11,A16;
suppose x = a;

hence thesis by A7,A17;
end;
suppose a = z;

hence thesis by A8,A17;
end;
suppose ((not [ x,a ] in R) & a <> x);

then [ a,x ] in R by A3,A16,CKB14:def 1;
hence thesis by A12,A17,A18,WAYBEL_4:def 4;
end;
suppose ((not [ a,z ] in R) & a <> z);

then [ z,a ] in R by A4,A16,CKB14:def 1;
hence thesis by A10,A17,A18,WAYBEL_4:def 4;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
suppose that A19: a = y
and
A20: b in C;
now
reconsider b as (Element of L) by A20;
A21: b <= b;
per cases  by A11,A20;
suppose x = b;

hence thesis by A7,A19;
end;
suppose b = z;

hence thesis by A8,A19;
end;
suppose ((not [ x,b ] in R) & b <> x);

then [ b,x ] in R by A3,A20,CKB14:def 1;
hence thesis by A12,A19,A21,WAYBEL_4:def 4;
end;
suppose ((not [ b,z ] in R) & b <> z);

then [ z,b ] in R by A4,A20,CKB14:def 1;
hence thesis by A10,A19,A21,WAYBEL_4:def 4;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
suppose (a = y & b = y);

hence thesis;
end;
end;
C c= ( C \/ { y } ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
then ( C \/ { y } ) = C by A13,A1,CKB21:def 1;
then y in C by ZFMISC_1:39;
hence thesis by A11,A7,A8,A9;
end;
