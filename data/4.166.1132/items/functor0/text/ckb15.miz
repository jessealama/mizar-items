theorem
Th11: (for f,g being Function holds ((f is  one-to-one & g is  one-to-one) implies ( ( ~ [: f,g :] ) " ) = ( ~ ( [: g,f :] " ) )))
proof
let f being Function;
let g being Function;
assume that
A1: f is  one-to-one
and
A2: g is  one-to-one;
A3: ( [: g,f :] " ) = [: ( g " ),( f " ) :] by A1,A2,CKB11:1;
then A4: ( dom ( [: g,f :] " ) ) = [: ( dom ( g " ) ),( dom ( f " ) ) :] by FUNCT_3:def 8;
A5: ( dom [: f,g :] ) = [: ( dom f ),( dom g ) :] by FUNCT_3:def 8;
A6: ( dom [: g,f :] ) = [: ( dom g ),( dom f ) :] by FUNCT_3:def 8;
A7: [: g,f :] is  one-to-one by A1,A2,ISOCAT_1:1;
A8: [: f,g :] is  one-to-one by A1,A2,ISOCAT_1:1;
then A9: ( ~ [: f,g :] ) is  one-to-one by CKB13:1;
A10: ( [: f,g :] " ) = [: ( f " ),( g " ) :] by A1,A2,CKB11:1;
A11: ( dom ( ~ ( [: g,f :] " ) ) ) = [: ( dom ( f " ) ),( dom ( g " ) ) :] by A4,FUNCT_4:46
.= ( dom [: ( f " ),( g " ) :] ) by FUNCT_3:def 8
.= ( rng [: f,g :] ) by A8,A10,FUNCT_1:32
.= ( rng ( ~ [: f,g :] ) ) by A5,FUNCT_4:47;
now
let y being set;
let x being set;
hereby
assume that
A12: y in ( rng ( ~ [: f,g :] ) )
and
A13: x = ( ( ~ ( [: g,f :] " ) ) . y );
y in ( rng [: f,g :] ) by A5,A12,FUNCT_4:47;
then y in [: ( rng f ),( rng g ) :] by FUNCT_3:67;
then consider y1,y2 being set such that A14: y1 in ( rng f ) and A15: y2 in ( rng g ) and A16: y = [ y1,y2 ] by ZFMISC_1:84;
set x1 = ( ( f " ) . y1 );
set x2 = ( ( g " ) . y2 );
A17: y2 in ( dom ( g " ) ) by A2,A15,FUNCT_1:32;
A18: y1 in ( dom ( f " ) ) by A1,A14,FUNCT_1:32;
then [ y2,y1 ] in ( dom ( [: g,f :] " ) ) by A4,A17,ZFMISC_1:87;
then A19: ( ( ~ ( [: g,f :] " ) ) . (y1,y2) ) = ( [: ( g " ),( f " ) :] . (y2,y1) ) by A3,FUNCT_4:def 2
.= [ x2,x1 ] by A17,A18,FUNCT_3:def 8;
A20: y1 in ( dom ( f " ) ) by A1,A14,FUNCT_1:32;
A21: y2 in ( dom ( g " ) ) by A2,A15,FUNCT_1:32;
A22: x1 in ( rng ( f " ) ) by A20,FUNCT_1:def 3;
A23: x2 in ( rng ( g " ) ) by A21,FUNCT_1:def 3;
A24: x1 in ( dom f ) by A1,A22,FUNCT_1:33;
A25: x2 in ( dom g ) by A2,A23,FUNCT_1:33;
then A26: [ x2,x1 ] in ( dom [: g,f :] ) by A6,A24,ZFMISC_1:87;
then A27: [ x2,x1 ] in ( dom ( ~ [: f,g :] ) ) by A5,A6,FUNCT_4:46;
thus x in ( dom ( ~ [: f,g :] ) ) by A5,A6,A13,A16,A19,A26,FUNCT_4:46;
A28: ( f . x1 ) = y1 by A1,A14,FUNCT_1:32;
A29: ( g . x2 ) = y2 by A2,A15,FUNCT_1:32;
thus ( ( ~ [: f,g :] ) . x ) = ( ( ~ [: f,g :] ) . (x2,x1) ) by A13,A16,A19
.= ( [: f,g :] . (x1,x2) ) by A27,FUNCT_4:43
.= y by A16,A24,A25,A28,A29,FUNCT_3:def 8;
end;
assume that
A30: x in ( dom ( ~ [: f,g :] ) )
and
A31: ( ( ~ [: f,g :] ) . x ) = y;
thus y in ( rng ( ~ [: f,g :] ) ) by A30,A31,FUNCT_1:def 3;
x in ( dom [: g,f :] ) by A5,A6,A30,FUNCT_4:46;
then consider x1,x2 being set such that A32: x1 in ( dom g ) and A33: x2 in ( dom f ) and A34: x = [ x1,x2 ] by A6,ZFMISC_1:84;
A35: ( ( ~ [: f,g :] ) . (x1,x2) ) = ( [: f,g :] . (x2,x1) ) by A30,A34,FUNCT_4:43
.= [ ( f . x2 ),( g . x1 ) ] by A32,A33,FUNCT_3:def 8;
A36: ( g . x1 ) in ( rng g ) by A32,FUNCT_1:def 3;
( f . x2 ) in ( rng f ) by A33,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then [ ( g . x1 ),( f . x2 ) ] in [: ( rng g ),( rng f ) :] by A36,ZFMISC_1:87;
then [ ( g . x1 ),( f . x2 ) ] in ( rng [: g,f :] ) by FUNCT_3:67;
then A37: [ ( g . x1 ),( f . x2 ) ] in ( dom ( [: g,f :] " ) ) by A7,FUNCT_1:33;
[ x1,x2 ] in ( dom [: g,f :] ) by A6,A32,A33,ZFMISC_1:87;
hence x = ( ( [: g,f :] " ) . ( [: g,f :] . (x1,x2) ) ) by A7,A34,FUNCT_1:34
.= ( ( [: g,f :] " ) . (( g . x1 ),( f . x2 )) ) by A32,A33,FUNCT_3:def 8
.= ( ( ~ ( [: g,f :] " ) ) . (( f . x2 ),( g . x1 )) ) by A37,FUNCT_4:def 2
.= ( ( ~ ( [: g,f :] " ) ) . y ) by A31,A34,A35;
