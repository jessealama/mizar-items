theorem
Th36: (for A,B being  transitive  with_units non  empty AltCatStr holds (for F being  feasible FunctorStr over A,B holds (F is  bijective implies ( F " ) is  bijective  feasible)))
proof
let A being  transitive  with_units non  empty AltCatStr;
let B being  transitive  with_units non  empty AltCatStr;
let F being  feasible FunctorStr over A,B;
assume that
A1: F is  bijective;
set G = ( F " );
A2: (the ObjectMap of G) = ( (the ObjectMap of F) " ) by A1,CKB113:def 1;
A3: F is  injective by A1,CKB92:def 1;
then F is  one-to-one by CKB90:def 1;
then A4: (the ObjectMap of F) is  one-to-one by CKB36:def 1;
hence (the ObjectMap of G) is  one-to-one by A2;
F is  faithful by A3,CKB90:def 1;
then A5: (the MorphMap of F) is  "1-1" by CKB87:def 1;
A6: F is  surjective by A1,CKB92:def 1;
then F is  onto by CKB91:def 1;
then A7: (the ObjectMap of F) is  onto by CKB37:def 1;
consider h being (ManySortedFunction of (the Arrows of A),( (the Arrows of B) * (the ObjectMap of F) )) such that A8: h = (the MorphMap of F) and A9: (the MorphMap of G) = ( ( h "" ) * ( (the ObjectMap of F) " ) ) by A1,CKB113:def 1;
F is  full by A6,CKB91:def 1;
then A10: (ex f being (ManySortedFunction of (the Arrows of A),( (the Arrows of B) * (the ObjectMap of F) )) st (f = (the MorphMap of F) & f is  "onto")) by CKB89:def 1;
set AA = [: (the carrier of A),(the carrier of A) :];
set BB = [: (the carrier of B),(the carrier of B) :];
A11: ( rng (the ObjectMap of F) ) = BB by A7,FUNCT_2:def 3;
reconsider f = (the MorphMap of G) as (ManySortedFunction of (the Arrows of B),( (the Arrows of A) * (the ObjectMap of G) )) by CKB28:def 1;
f is  "1-1"
proof
let i being set;
let g being Function;
assume that
A12: i in ( dom f )
and
A13: ( f . i ) = g;
i in BB by A12,PARTFUN1:def 2;
then A14: i in ( dom ( (the ObjectMap of F) " ) ) by A4,A11,FUNCT_1:33;
then ( ( (the ObjectMap of F) " ) . i ) in ( rng ( (the ObjectMap of F) " ) ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
then A15: ( ( (the ObjectMap of F) " ) . i ) in ( dom (the ObjectMap of F) ) by A4,FUNCT_1:33;
then ( ( (the ObjectMap of F) " ) . i ) in AA;
then ( ( (the ObjectMap of F) " ) . i ) in ( dom h ) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
then A16: ( h . ( ( (the ObjectMap of F) " ) . i ) ) is  one-to-one by A5,A8,MSUALG_3:def 2;
g = ( ( h "" ) . ( ( (the ObjectMap of F) " ) . i ) ) by A9,A13,A14,FUNCT_1:13
.= ( ( h . ( ( (the ObjectMap of F) " ) . i ) ) " ) by A5,A8,A10,A15,MSUALG_3:def 4;
hence thesis by A16;
end;
hence (the MorphMap of G) is  "1-1";
thus G is  full
proof
take f;
thus f = (the MorphMap of G);
let i being set;

then ( (the Arrows of B) . ( (the ObjectMap of F) . (o1,o2) ) ) <> ( {} ) by CKB42:def 1;
hence ( ( (the Arrows of B) * (the ObjectMap of F) ) . j ) <> ( {} ) by A2,A20,A23,FUNCT_1:13;
end;
( f . i ) = ( ( h "" ) . ( ( (the ObjectMap of F) " ) . i ) ) by A9,A19,FUNCT_1:13
.= ( ( h . ( ( (the ObjectMap of F) " ) . i ) ) " ) by A5,A8,A10,A20,MSUALG_3:def 4;

thus ( rng (the ObjectMap of G) ) = ( dom (the ObjectMap of F) ) by A2,A4,FUNCT_1:33
.= AA by FUNCT_2:def 1;
let o1 being (object of B);

then A25: ( (the Arrows of B) . (o1,o2) ) <> ( {} ) by ALTCAT_1:def 1;
A26: [ o1,o2 ] in BB by ZFMISC_1:87;
then consider p1,p2 being (Element of A) such that A27: ( (the ObjectMap of G) . [ o1,o2 ] ) = [ p1,p2 ] by DOMAIN_1:1,FUNCT_2:5;
reconsider p1,p2 as (object of A);
[ o1,o2 ] in ( dom (the ObjectMap of G) ) by A26,FUNCT_2:def 1;

A30: [ p1,p2 ] in AA by ZFMISC_1:87;

hence contradiction by A25;
