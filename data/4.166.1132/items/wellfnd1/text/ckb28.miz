theorem
(for R being non  empty RelStr holds (R is  well_founded iff (not (ex f being (sequence of R) st f is  descending))))
proof
let R being non  empty RelStr;
set c = (the carrier of R);
set r = (the InternalRel of R);
hereby
assume R is  well_founded;
then A1: r is_well_founded_in c by CKB10:def 1;
given f being (sequence of R) such that
A2: f is  descending;

A3: ( dom f ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( rng f ) <> ( {} ) by RELAT_1:42;
then consider a being set such that A4: a in ( rng f ) and A5: ( r -Seg a ) misses ( rng f ) by A1,WELLORD1:def 3;
consider n being set such that A6: n in ( dom f ) and A7: a = ( f . n ) by A4,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider n as (Element of ( NAT )) by A6;
(( f . ( n + 1 ) ) <> ( f . n ) & [ ( f . ( n + 1 ) ),( f . n ) ] in (the InternalRel of R)) by A2,CKB27:def 1;
then A8: ( f . ( n + 1 ) ) in ( r -Seg ( f . n ) ) by WELLORD1:1;
( f . ( n + 1 ) ) in ( rng f ) by A3,FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence contradiction by A5,A7,A8,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
assume A9: (not (ex f being (sequence of R) st f is  descending));
assume (not R is  well_founded);
then (not r is_well_founded_in c) by CKB10:def 1;
then consider Y being set such that A10: Y c= c and A11: Y <> ( {} ) and A12: (for a being set holds ((not a in Y) or ( r -Seg a ) meets Y)) by WELLORD1:def 3;
deffunc G(set,set) = ( choose ( ( r -Seg $2 ) /\ Y ) );
consider f being Function such that A13: ( dom f ) = ( NAT ) and A14: ( f . ( 0 ) ) = ( choose Y ) and A15: (for n being Nat holds ( f . ( n + 1 ) ) = G(n,( f . n ))) from NAT_1:sch 11;
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
( f . $1 ) in Y;
A16:now
let n being Nat;
assume P[ n ];
then ( r -Seg ( f . n ) ) meets Y by A12;
then A17: ( ( r -Seg ( f . n ) ) /\ Y ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
( f . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( choose ( ( r -Seg ( f . n ) ) /\ Y ) ) by A15;
hence P[ ( n + 1 ) ] by A17,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
A18: P[ ( 0 ) ] by A11,A14;
A19: (for n being Nat holds P[ n ]) from NAT_1:sch 2(A18,A16);
( rng f ) c= c
proof
let y being set;
assume y in ( rng f );
then consider x being set such that A20: x in ( dom f ) and A21: y = ( f . x ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider n = x as (Element of ( NAT )) by A13,A20;
( f . n ) in Y by A19;
hence thesis by A10,A21;
end;
then reconsider f as (sequence of R) by A13,FUNCT_2:2;
now
let n being Nat;
( r -Seg ( f . n ) ) meets Y by A12,A19;
then A22: ( ( r -Seg ( f . n ) ) /\ Y ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
( f . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( choose ( ( r -Seg ( f . n ) ) /\ Y ) ) by A15;
then ( f . ( n + 1 ) ) in ( r -Seg ( f . n ) ) by A22,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence (( f . ( n + 1 ) ) <> ( f . n ) & [ ( f . ( n + 1 ) ),( f . n ) ] in r) by WELLORD1:1;
end;
then f is  descending by CKB27:def 1;
hence contradiction by A9;
end;
