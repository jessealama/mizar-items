proof
assume that
A1: V1 = X
and
A2: d1 = ( 0. V )
and

proof
set Mv = (the multF of V);

hereby

reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y as (VECTOR of V) by A1,TARSKI:def 3;

hereby

reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y,z1 = z as (VECTOR of V) by A1,TARSKI:def 3;
( x + ( y + z ) ) = ( Av . (x1,( y + z )) ) by A8;
then A12: ( x + ( y + z ) ) = ( x1 + ( y1 + z1 ) ) by A8;
( ( x + y ) + z ) = ( Av . (( x + y ),z1) ) by A8;
then ( ( x + y ) + z ) = ( ( x1 + y1 ) + z1 ) by A8;
hence ( ( x + y ) + z ) = ( x + ( y + z ) ) by A12,RLVECT_1:def 3;
end;
hereby
let x being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider y = x as (VECTOR of V) by A1,TARSKI:def 3;
thus ( x + ( 0. W ) ) = ( y + ( 0. V ) ) by A2,A8
.= x by RLVECT_1:4;
end;
thus W is  right_complementable
proof

consider v being (Element of V) such that A13: ( x1 + v ) = ( 0. V ) by ALGSTR_0:def 11;
