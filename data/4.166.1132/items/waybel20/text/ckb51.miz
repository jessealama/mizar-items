theorem
(for L being  continuous  complete LATTICE holds (for p being  projection (Function of L,L) holds (p is  infs-preserving implies (( Image p ) is  continuous  continuous LATTICE & ( Image p ) is  infs-inheriting))))
proof
let L being  continuous  complete LATTICE;
let p being  projection (Function of L,L);
assume that
A1: p is  infs-preserving;
reconsider Lc = { c where c is (Element of L): c <= ( p . c ) } as non  empty (Subset of L) by WAYBEL_1:43;
reconsider pc = ( p | Lc ) as (Function of ( subrelstr Lc ),( subrelstr Lc )) by WAYBEL_1:45;
A2: ( subrelstr Lc ) is  infs-inheriting by A1,WAYBEL_1:51;
then A3: ( subrelstr Lc ) is  complete by YELLOW_2:30;
A4: pc is  infs-preserving
proof
let X being (Subset of ( subrelstr Lc ));
assume  ex_inf_of X,( subrelstr Lc );
thus  ex_inf_of ( pc .: X ),( subrelstr Lc ) by A3,YELLOW_0:17;
(the carrier of ( subrelstr Lc )) = Lc by YELLOW_0:def 15;
then reconsider X9 = X as (Subset of L) by XBOOLE_1:1;
A5: ( ex_inf_of X9,L & p preserves_inf_of X9) by A1,WAYBEL_0:def 32,YELLOW_0:17;
X c= (the carrier of ( subrelstr Lc ));
then X c= Lc by YELLOW_0:def 15;
then A6: ( pc .: X ) = ( p .: X ) by RELAT_1:129;
A7:  ex_inf_of X,L by YELLOW_0:17;
then ( "/\" (X9,L) ) in (the carrier of ( subrelstr Lc )) by A2,YELLOW_0:def 18;
then A8: (( dom pc ) = (the carrier of ( subrelstr Lc )) & ( inf X9 ) = ( inf X )) by A7,FUNCT_2:def 1,YELLOW_0:63;
 ex_inf_of ( pc .: X ),L by YELLOW_0:17;
then ( ex_inf_of ( p .: X ),L & ( "/\" (( pc .: X ),L) ) in (the carrier of ( subrelstr Lc ))) by A2,YELLOW_0:17,YELLOW_0:def 18;
hence ( inf ( pc .: X ) ) = ( inf ( p .: X ) ) by A6,YELLOW_0:63
.= ( p . ( inf X9 ) ) by A5,WAYBEL_0:def 30
.= ( pc . ( inf X ) ) by A8,FUNCT_1:47;
end;
reconsider cpc = ( corestr pc ) as (Function of ( subrelstr Lc ),( Image pc ));
A9: (the carrier of ( subrelstr ( rng p ) )) = ( rng p ) by YELLOW_0:def 15
.= ( rng pc ) by WAYBEL_1:44
.= (the carrier of ( subrelstr ( rng pc ) )) by YELLOW_0:def 15;
( subrelstr ( rng pc ) ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of L) by WAYBEL15:1;
then A10: ( Image p ) = ( Image pc ) by A9,YELLOW_0:57;
pc is  closure by WAYBEL_1:47;
then A11: cpc is  sups-preserving by WAYBEL_1:55;
( subrelstr Lc ) is  sups-inheriting  sups-inheriting (SubRelStr of L) by WAYBEL_1:49;
then ( subrelstr Lc ) is  continuous  continuous LATTICE by A2,WAYBEL_5:28;
hence ( Image p ) is  continuous  continuous LATTICE by A3,A10,A4,A11,CKB20:1,WAYBEL_5:33;
thus thesis by A1,A2,WAYBEL_1:51;
