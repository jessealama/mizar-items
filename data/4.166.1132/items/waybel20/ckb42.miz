theorem
Th39: (for L being  continuous  complete LATTICE holds (for R being (Subset of [: L,L :]) holds ((R is (Equivalence_Relation of (the carrier of L)) & (ex LR being  continuous  complete LATTICE st ((the carrier of LR) = ( Class ( EqRel R ) ) & (for g being (Function of L,LR) holds ((for x being (Element of L) holds ( g . x ) = ( Class (( EqRel R ),x) )) implies g is (CLHomomorphism of L,LR)))))) implies ( subrelstr R ) is (CLSubFrame of [: L,L :]))))
proof
let L being  continuous  complete LATTICE;
let R being (Subset of [: L,L :]);
assume R is (Equivalence_Relation of (the carrier of L));
then A1: ( EqRel R ) = R by CKB36:def 1;
set ER = ( EqRel R );
given LR being  continuous  complete LATTICE such that
A2: (the carrier of LR) = ( Class ( EqRel R ) )
and
A3: (for g being (Function of L,LR) holds ((for x being (Element of L) holds ( g . x ) = ( Class (( EqRel R ),x) )) implies g is (CLHomomorphism of L,LR)));

deffunc F(set) = ( Class (ER,$1) );
set CER = ( Class ER );
set cL = (the carrier of L);
set cLR = (the carrier of LR);
A4: (for x being set holds (x in cL implies F(x) in CER)) by EQREL_1:def 3;
consider g being (Function of cL,CER) such that A5: (for x being set holds (x in cL implies ( g . x ) = F(x))) from FUNCT_2:sch 2(A4);
reconsider g as (Function of L,LR) by A2;
set k = g;
A6: ( dom g ) = cL by FUNCT_2:def 1;
now
let x being set;
hereby
assume A7: x in R;
then x in (the carrier of [: L,L :]);
then x in [: cL,cL :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then consider x1 being set,x2 being set such that A8: (x1 in cL & x2 in cL) and A9: x = [ x1,x2 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider x1,x2 as (Element of L) by A8;
A10: (( k . x1 ) = ( Class (( EqRel R ),x1) ) & ( k . x2 ) = ( Class (( EqRel R ),x2) )) by A5;
x1 in ( Class (( EqRel R ),x2) ) by A1,A7,A9,EQREL_1:19;
then ( k . x1 ) = ( k . x2 ) by A10,EQREL_1:23;
then A11: [ ( k . x1 ),( k . x2 ) ] in ( id cLR ) by RELAT_1:def 10;
( dom [: k,k :] ) = [: ( dom k ),( dom k ) :] by FUNCT_3:def 8;
then A12: [ x1,x2 ] in ( dom [: k,k :] ) by A6,ZFMISC_1:87;
( [: k,k :] . (x1,x2) ) = [ ( k . x1 ),( k . x2 ) ] by A6,FUNCT_3:def 8;
hence x in ( [: k,k :] " ( id cLR ) ) by A9,A11,A12,FUNCT_1:def 7;
end;
assume A13: x in ( [: k,k :] " ( id cLR ) );
then A14: ( [: k,k :] . x ) in ( id cLR ) by FUNCT_1:def 7;
x in ( dom [: k,k :] ) by A13,FUNCT_1:def 7;
then x in [: ( dom k ),( dom k ) :] by FUNCT_3:def 8;
then consider x1 being set,x2 being set such that A15: (x1 in ( dom k ) & x2 in ( dom k )) and A16: x = [ x1,x2 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider x1,x2 as (Element of L) by A15;
A17: (( k . x1 ) = ( Class (( EqRel R ),x1) ) & ( k . x2 ) = ( Class (( EqRel R ),x2) )) by A5;
( [: k,k :] . (x1,x2) ) = [ ( k . x1 ),( k . x2 ) ] by A15,FUNCT_3:def 8;
then ( k . x1 ) = ( k . x2 ) by A14,A16,RELAT_1:def 10;
then x1 in ( Class (ER,x2) ) by A17,EQREL_1:23;
hence x in R by A1,A16,EQREL_1:19;
end;
then A18: R = ( [: g,g :] " ( id (the carrier of LR) ) ) by TARSKI:1;
(for x being (Element of L) holds ( g . x ) = ( Class (( EqRel R ),x) )) by A5;
then g is (CLHomomorphism of L,LR) by A3;
hence thesis by A18,CKB35:1;
end;
