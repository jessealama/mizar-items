proof
let e being set;
assume A123: (e qua set) in X;
then reconsider e as (POINT of IPP) by A9;
(ex e9 being (POINT of IPP) st (e = e9 & e9 on K)) by A9,A123;
hence thesis by A1,A4,A121,CKB20:def 1;
end;
A124: (for x being (POINT of IPP) holds (x in X implies ( ( ( IncProj (L,q,R) ) * ( IncProj (K,p,L) ) ) . x ) = ( ( IncProj (K,p,R) ) . x )))

proof
