theorem
Lm1: (((((((ex o st (o on A & o on B)) & a on A) & b on A) & c on A) & d on A) & a,b,c,d are_mutually_different ) implies (ex p st (ex q st (ex r st (ex s st ((((p on B & q on B) & r on B) & s on B) & p,q,r,s are_mutually_different ))))))
proof
assume that
A1: (ex o st (o on A & o on B))
and
A2: a on A
and
A3: b on A
and
A4: c on A
and
A5: d on A
and
A6: a,b,c,d are_mutually_different ;
consider o such that A7: o on A and A8: o on B by A1;
now
assume A <> B;
then consider x,y such that A9: x on A and A10: (not x on B) and A11: y on B and A12: (not y on A) by CKB3:1;

assume v1 = v2;
then D1 = D2 by A21,A22,A24,A25,A27,A19,INCPROJ:def 4;

A30:now

proof

take v;
take D;
thus (((v on B & w on D) & u on D) & v on D) by A34,A35;
end;
now
consider D such that A36: (w on D & u on D) by INCPROJ:def 5;
assume A37: u = o;
take v = o;
take D;
thus (((v on B & w on D) & u on D) & v on D) by A8,A37,A36;

hence (ex v st (ex D st (((v on B & w on D) & u on D) & v on D))) by A11,A13,A14,A15,A32;
