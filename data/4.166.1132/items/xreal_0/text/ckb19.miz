theorem
Lm6: ((r <= s & s <= t) implies r <= t)
proof
assume that
A1: r <= s
and
A2: s <= t;
A3: (r in ( REAL ) & s in ( REAL )) by CKB1:def 1;
A4: t in ( REAL ) by CKB1:def 1;
per cases  by A3,A4,NUMBERS:def 1,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose that A5: r in ( REAL+ )
and
A6: s in ( REAL+ )
and
A7: t in ( REAL+ );
consider s99,t9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A8: s = s99 and A9: t = t9 and A10: s99 <=' t9 by A2,A6,A7,XXREAL_0:def 5;
consider x9,s9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A11: r = x9 and A12: (s = s9 & x9 <=' s9) by A1,A5,A6,XXREAL_0:def 5;
x9 <=' t9 by A12,A8,A10,ARYTM_1:3;
hence thesis by A11,A9,CKB15:1;
end;
suppose A13: (r in ( REAL+ ) & s in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]);

then ((not (r in ( REAL+ ) & s in ( REAL+ ))) & (not (r in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & s in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))) by ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A1,A13,XXREAL_0:def 5;
end;
suppose A14: (s in ( REAL+ ) & t in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]);

then ((not (t in ( REAL+ ) & s in ( REAL+ ))) & (not (t in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & s in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))) by ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A2,A14,XXREAL_0:def 5;
end;
suppose that A15: r in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]
and
A16: t in ( REAL+ );
((not (r in ( REAL+ ) & t in ( REAL+ ))) & (not (r in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & t in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))) by A15,A16,ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A16,XXREAL_0:def 5;
end;
suppose that A17: r in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]
and
A18: s in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]
and
A19: t in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :];
consider s99,t9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A20: s = [ ( 0 ),s99 ] and A21: t = [ ( 0 ),t9 ] and A22: t9 <=' s99 by A2,A18,A19,XXREAL_0:def 5;
consider x9,s9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A23: r = [ ( 0 ),x9 ] and A24: s = [ ( 0 ),s9 ] and A25: s9 <=' x9 by A1,A17,A18,XXREAL_0:def 5;
s9 = s99 by A24,A20,ZFMISC_1:27;
then t9 <=' x9 by A25,A22,ARYTM_1:3;
hence thesis by A17,A19,A23,A21,CKB15:1;
