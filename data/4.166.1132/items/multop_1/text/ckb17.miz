provided
A1: (for x being (Element of X()) holds (for y being (Element of Y()) holds (for z being (Element of Z()) holds (for s being (Element of S()) holds (ex t being (Element of T()) st P[ x,y,z,s,t ])))))
proof
defpred Q[ set,set ]
 means
(for x being (Element of X()) holds (for y being (Element of Y()) holds (for z being (Element of Z()) holds (for s being (Element of S()) holds ($1 = [ x,y,z,s ] implies P[ x,y,z,s,$2 ])))));
A2: (for p being (Element of [: X(),Y(),Z(),S() :]) holds (ex t being (Element of T()) st Q[ p,t ]))
proof
let p being (Element of [: X(),Y(),Z(),S() :]);
consider x1,y1,z1,s1 being set such that A3: x1 in X() and A4: y1 in Y() and A5: z1 in Z() and A6: s1 in S() and A7: p = [ x1,y1,z1,s1 ] by MCART_1:79;
reconsider s1 as (Element of S()) by A6;
reconsider z1 as (Element of Z()) by A5;
reconsider y1 as (Element of Y()) by A4;
reconsider x1 as (Element of X()) by A3;
consider t being (Element of T()) such that A8: P[ x1,y1,z1,s1,t ] by A1;
take t;
let x being (Element of X());
let y being (Element of Y());
let z being (Element of Z());
let s being (Element of S());
assume A9: p = [ x,y,z,s ];
then A10: z1 = z by A7,MCART_1:29;
(x1 = x & y1 = y) by A7,A9,MCART_1:29;
hence thesis by A7,A8,A9,A10,MCART_1:29;

consider f being (Function of [: X(),Y(),Z(),S() :],T()) such that A11: (for p being (Element of [: X(),Y(),Z(),S() :]) holds Q[ p,( f . p ) ]) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A2);
take f;
let x being (Element of X());
let y being (Element of Y());
let z being (Element of Z());
let s being (Element of S());
thus thesis by A11;
