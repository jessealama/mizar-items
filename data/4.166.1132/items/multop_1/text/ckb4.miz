theorem
Th3: (for f1,f2 being (Function of [: A,B,C :],D) holds ((for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ( f1 . [ a,b,c ] ) = ( f2 . [ a,b,c ] )))) implies f1 = f2))
proof
let f1 being (Function of [: A,B,C :],D),f2 being (Function of [: A,B,C :],D);
assume (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ( f1 . [ a,b,c ] ) = ( f2 . [ a,b,c ] ))));
then (for x holds (for y holds (for z holds (((x in A & y in B) & z in C) implies ( f1 . [ x,y,z ] ) = ( f2 . [ x,y,z ] )))));
hence thesis by CKB3:1;
