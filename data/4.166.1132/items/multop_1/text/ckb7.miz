provided
A1: (for x being (Element of X()) holds (for y being (Element of Y()) holds (for z being (Element of Z()) holds (ex t being (Element of T()) st P[ x,y,z,t ]))))
proof
defpred Q[ set,set ]
 means
(for x being (Element of X()) holds (for y being (Element of Y()) holds (for z being (Element of Z()) holds ($1 = [ x,y,z ] implies P[ x,y,z,$2 ]))));
A2: (for p being (Element of [: X(),Y(),Z() :]) holds (ex t being (Element of T()) st Q[ p,t ]))
proof
let p being (Element of [: X(),Y(),Z() :]);
consider x1,y1,z1 being set such that A3: x1 in X() and A4: y1 in Y() and A5: z1 in Z() and A6: p = [ x1,y1,z1 ] by MCART_1:68;
reconsider z1 as (Element of Z()) by A5;
reconsider y1 as (Element of Y()) by A4;
reconsider x1 as (Element of X()) by A3;
consider t being (Element of T()) such that A7: P[ x1,y1,z1,t ] by A1;
take t;
let x being (Element of X());
let y being (Element of Y());
let z being (Element of Z());
assume A8: p = [ x,y,z ];
then (x1 = x & y1 = y) by A6,MCART_1:25;
hence thesis by A6,A7,A8,MCART_1:25;
end;
consider f being (Function of [: X(),Y(),Z() :],T()) such that A9: (for p being (Element of [: X(),Y(),Z() :]) holds Q[ p,( f . p ) ]) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A2);
take f;
let x being (Element of X());
let y being (Element of Y());
let z being (Element of Z());
thus thesis by A9;
