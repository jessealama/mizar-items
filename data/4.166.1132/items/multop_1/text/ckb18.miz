begin
scheme QuaOpEx { A() -> non empty set,P[(Element of A()),(Element of A()),(Element of A()),(Element of A()),(Element of A())] } : (ex o being (QuaOp of A()) st (for a,b,c,d being (Element of A()) holds P[ a,b,c,d,( o . (a,b,c,d) ) ]))
provided
A1: (for x,y,z,s being (Element of A()) holds (ex t being (Element of A()) st P[ x,y,z,s,t ]))
proof
defpred Q[ (Element of A()),(Element of A()),(Element of A()),(Element of A()),(Element of A()) ]
 means
(for r being (Element of A()) holds (r = $5 implies P[ $1,$2,$3,$4,$5 ]));
A2: (for x,y,z,s being (Element of A()) holds (ex t being (Element of A()) st Q[ x,y,z,s,t ]))
proof
let x being (Element of A()),y being (Element of A()),z being (Element of A()),s being (Element of A());
consider t being (Element of A()) such that A3: P[ x,y,z,s,t ] by A1;
take t;
thus thesis by A3;
end;
consider f being (Function of [: A(),A(),A(),A() :],A()) such that A4: (for a,b,c,d being (Element of A()) holds Q[ a,b,c,d,( f . [ a,b,c,d ] ) ]) from CKB17:sch 1(A2);
take f;
let a being (Element of A()),b being (Element of A()),c being (Element of A()),d being (Element of A());
thus thesis by A4;
