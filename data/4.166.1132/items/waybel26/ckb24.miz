theorem
Th16: (for Y,Z being non empty TopSpace holds (for X being  monotone-convergence T_0-TopSpace holds (for f being  continuous (Function of Y,Z) holds ( oContMaps (f,X) ) is  directed-sups-preserving)))
proof
let Y being non empty TopSpace,Z being non empty TopSpace;
let X being  monotone-convergence T_0-TopSpace;
let f being  continuous (Function of Y,Z);
let A being (Subset of ( oContMaps (Z,X) ));
reconsider sA = ( sup A ) as  continuous (Function of Z,X) by CKB7:1;
set fX = ( oContMaps (f,X) );
reconsider sfA = ( sup ( fX .: A ) ),XfsA = ( fX . ( sup A ) ) as (Function of Y,( Omega X )) by CKB6:1;
reconsider YX = ( oContMaps (Y,X) ) as  directed-sups-inheriting non empty  full (SubRelStr of ( ( Omega X ) |^ (the carrier of Y) )) by WAYBEL24:def 3,WAYBEL25:43;
assume A is non empty  directed;
then reconsider A9 = A as non empty  directed (Subset of ( oContMaps (Z,X) ));
reconsider fA9 = ( fX .: A9 ) as non empty  directed (Subset of ( oContMaps (Y,X) )) by CKB19:1,YELLOW_2:15;
reconsider ZX = ( oContMaps (Z,X) ) as  directed-sups-inheriting non empty  full (SubRelStr of ( ( Omega X ) |^ (the carrier of Z) )) by WAYBEL24:def 3,WAYBEL25:43;
reconsider B = A9 as non empty  directed (Subset of ZX);
reconsider B9 = B as non empty  directed (Subset of ( ( Omega X ) |^ (the carrier of Z) )) by YELLOW_2:7;
reconsider fB = fA9 as non empty  directed (Subset of YX);
reconsider fB9 = fB as non empty  directed (Subset of ( ( Omega X ) |^ (the carrier of Y) )) by YELLOW_2:7;
assume  ex_sup_of A,( oContMaps (Z,X) );
set I1 = (the carrier of Z);
set I2 = (the carrier of Y);
set J1 = ( I1 --> ( Omega X ) );
set J2 = ( I2 --> ( Omega X ) );
 ex_sup_of fB9,( ( Omega X ) |^ (the carrier of Y) ) by WAYBEL_0:75;
then A1: ( sup fB9 ) = ( sup ( ( oContMaps (f,X) ) .: A ) ) by WAYBEL_0:7;
(( oContMaps (Y,X) ) is  up-complete & fA9 is  directed) by CKB16:1;
hence  ex_sup_of ( ( oContMaps (f,X) ) .: A ),( oContMaps (Y,X) ) by WAYBEL_0:75;
A2: ( ( Omega X ) |^ I2 ) = ( I2 -POS_prod J2 ) by YELLOW_1:def 5;
then reconsider fB99 = fB9 as non empty  directed (Subset of ( I2 -POS_prod J2 ));
now
let x being (Element of Y);
(( J2 . x ) = ( Omega X ) & ( pi (fB99,x) ) is  directed) by FUNCOP_1:7,YELLOW16:35;
hence  ex_sup_of ( pi (fB99,x) ),( J2 . x ) by WAYBEL_0:75;
end;
then A3:  ex_sup_of fB99,( I2 -POS_prod J2 ) by YELLOW16:31;
A4: ( ( Omega X ) |^ I1 ) = ( I1 -POS_prod J1 ) by YELLOW_1:def 5;
then reconsider B99 = B9 as non empty  directed (Subset of ( I1 -POS_prod J1 ));
A5:  ex_sup_of B9,( ( Omega X ) |^ (the carrier of Z) ) by WAYBEL_0:75;
then A6: ( sup B9 ) = ( sup A ) by WAYBEL_0:7;

A7: (( J1 . ( f . x ) ) = ( Omega X ) & ( J2 . x ) = ( Omega X )) by FUNCOP_1:7;
A8: ( pi (fB99,x) ) = ( pi (B99,( f . x )) ) by CKB23:1;
thus ( sfA . x ) = ( sup ( pi (fB99,x) ) ) by A1,A2,A3,YELLOW16:33
.= ( ( sup B99 ) . ( f . x ) ) by A5,A4,A7,A8,YELLOW16:33
.= ( ( sA * f ) . x ) by A6,A4,FUNCT_2:15
.= ( XfsA . x ) by CKB15:def 1;
