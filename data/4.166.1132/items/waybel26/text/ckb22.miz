theorem
Th14: (for X being non empty TopSpace holds (for Y,Z being  monotone-convergence T_0-TopSpace holds (for f being  continuous (Function of Y,Z) holds ( oContMaps (X,f) ) is  directed-sups-preserving)))
proof
let X being non empty TopSpace;
let Y being  monotone-convergence T_0-TopSpace,Z being  monotone-convergence T_0-TopSpace;
let f being  continuous (Function of Y,Z);
let A being (Subset of ( oContMaps (X,Y) ));
reconsider sA = ( sup A ) as  continuous (Function of X,Y) by CKB7:1;
set Xf = ( oContMaps (X,f) );
reconsider sfA = ( sup ( Xf .: A ) ),XfsA = ( Xf . ( sup A ) ) as (Function of X,( Omega Z )) by CKB6:1;
reconsider XZ = ( oContMaps (X,Z) ) as  directed-sups-inheriting non empty  full (SubRelStr of ( ( Omega Z ) |^ (the carrier of X) )) by WAYBEL24:def 3,WAYBEL25:43;
assume A is non empty  directed;
then reconsider A9 = A as non empty  directed (Subset of ( oContMaps (X,Y) ));
reconsider fA9 = ( Xf .: A9 ) as non empty  directed (Subset of ( oContMaps (X,Z) )) by CKB17:1,YELLOW_2:15;
reconsider XY = ( oContMaps (X,Y) ) as  directed-sups-inheriting non empty  full (SubRelStr of ( ( Omega Y ) |^ (the carrier of X) )) by WAYBEL24:def 3,WAYBEL25:43;
reconsider B = A9 as non empty  directed (Subset of XY);
reconsider B9 = B as non empty  directed (Subset of ( ( Omega Y ) |^ (the carrier of X) )) by YELLOW_2:7;
reconsider fB = fA9 as non empty  directed (Subset of XZ);
reconsider fB9 = fB as non empty  directed (Subset of ( ( Omega Z ) |^ (the carrier of X) )) by YELLOW_2:7;

set I = (the carrier of X);

set J2 = ( I --> ( Omega Z ) );
(( the TopStruct of Y ) = ( the TopStruct of ( Omega Y ) ) & ( the TopStruct of Z ) = ( the TopStruct of ( Omega Z ) )) by WAYBEL25:def 2;
then reconsider f9 = f as  continuous (Function of ( Omega Y ),( Omega Z )) by YELLOW12:36;
 ex_sup_of fB9,( ( Omega Z ) |^ (the carrier of X) ) by WAYBEL_0:75;
then A1: ( sup fB9 ) = ( sup ( ( oContMaps (X,f) ) .: A ) ) by WAYBEL_0:7;
(( oContMaps (X,Z) ) is  up-complete & fA9 is  directed) by CKB16:1;
hence  ex_sup_of ( ( oContMaps (X,f) ) .: A ),( oContMaps (X,Z) ) by WAYBEL_0:75;
A2: ( ( Omega Z ) |^ I ) = ( I -POS_prod J2 ) by YELLOW_1:def 5;
then reconsider fB99 = fB9 as non empty  directed (Subset of ( I -POS_prod J2 ));
now
let x being (Element of X);
(( J2 . x ) = ( Omega Z ) & ( pi (fB99,x) ) is  directed) by FUNCOP_1:7,YELLOW16:35;
hence  ex_sup_of ( pi (fB99,x) ),( J2 . x ) by WAYBEL_0:75;
end;
then A3:  ex_sup_of fB99,( I -POS_prod J2 ) by YELLOW16:31;
A4: ( ( Omega Y ) |^ (the carrier of X) ) = ( I -POS_prod J1 ) by YELLOW_1:def 5;
then reconsider B99 = B9 as non empty  directed (Subset of ( I -POS_prod J1 ));
A5:  ex_sup_of B9,( ( Omega Y ) |^ (the carrier of X) ) by WAYBEL_0:75;
then A6: ( sup B9 ) = ( sup A ) by WAYBEL_0:7;
now
let x being (Element of X);
A7: ( J1 . x ) = ( Omega Y ) by FUNCOP_1:7;
then reconsider Bx = ( pi (B99,x) ) as  directed non empty (Subset of ( Omega Y )) by YELLOW16:35;
A8: (( J2 . x ) = ( Omega Z ) &  ex_sup_of Bx,( Omega Y )) by FUNCOP_1:7,WAYBEL_0:75;
A9: ( ( sup B99 ) . x ) = ( sup ( pi (B99,x) ) ) by A5,A4,YELLOW16:33;
A10: (f9 preserves_sup_of Bx & ( pi (fB99,x) ) = ( f9 .: Bx )) by CKB21:1,WAYBEL_0:def 37;
thus ( sfA . x ) = ( sup ( pi (fB99,x) ) ) by A1,A2,A3,YELLOW16:33
.= ( f . ( sup Bx ) ) by A8,A10,WAYBEL_0:def 31
.= ( ( f * sA ) . x ) by A6,A4,A9,A7,FUNCT_2:15
.= ( XfsA . x ) by CKB14:def 1;

hence thesis by FUNCT_2:63;
