Th35: (for X being non  empty TopSpace holds (for M being non  empty set holds (ex F being (Function of ( oContMaps (X,( M -TOP_prod ( M --> ( Sierpinski_Space ) ) )) ),( M -POS_prod ( M --> ( oContMaps (X,( Sierpinski_Space )) ) ) )) st (F is  isomorphic & (for f being  continuous (Function of X,( M -TOP_prod ( M --> ( Sierpinski_Space ) ) )) holds ( F . f ) = ( commute f ))))))
