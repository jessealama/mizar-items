theorem
Th19: (for X being non  empty TopSpace holds (for Z being  monotone-convergence T_0-TopSpace holds (for Y being non  empty (SubSpace of Z) holds (for f being  continuous (Function of Z,Y) holds (f is  being_a_retraction implies ( oContMaps (X,f) ) is_a_retraction_of ( oContMaps (X,Z) ),( oContMaps (X,Y) ))))))
proof
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
let Z being  monotone-convergence T_0-TopSpace;
let Y being non  empty (SubSpace of Z);
set XY = ( oContMaps (X,Y) );
set XZ = ( oContMaps (X,Z) );
reconsider uXZ = XZ as  up-complete non  empty Poset by CKB16:1;
let f being  continuous (Function of Z,Y);
set F = ( oContMaps (X,f) );
reconsider sXY = XY as  full non  empty (SubRelStr of uXZ) by CKB25:1;
assume A1: f is  being_a_retraction;
then reconsider Y9 = Y as  monotone-convergence T_0-TopSpace by CKB27:1;
( oContMaps (X,Y9) ) is  up-complete by CKB16:1;
hence F is  directed-sups-preserving  directed-sups-preserving (Function of XZ,XY) by CKB22:1;
A2: (the carrier of sXY) c= (the carrier of uXZ) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
A3:now
let x being set;
A4: ( dom f ) = (the carrier of Z) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A5: (( rng f ) = (the carrier of Y) & f is  idempotent) by A1,YELLOW16:44,YELLOW16:45;
assume A6: x in (the carrier of XY);
then reconsider a = x as (Element of XZ) by A2;
reconsider a as  continuous (Function of X,Z) by CKB7:1;
x is (Function of X,Y) by A6,CKB7:1;
then ( rng a ) c= (the carrier of Y) by RELAT_1:def 19;
then ( f * a ) = a by A5,A4,YELLOW16:4;
hence ( ( id XY ) . x ) = ( f * a ) by A6,FUNCT_1:18
.= ( F . a ) by CKB14:def 1
.= ( ( F | (the carrier of XY) ) . x ) by A6,FUNCT_1:49;
end;
( F | (the carrier of XY) ) is (Function of (the carrier of XY),(the carrier of XY)) by A2,FUNCT_2:32;
then (( dom ( id XY ) ) = (the carrier of XY) & ( dom ( F | (the carrier of XY) ) ) = (the carrier of XY)) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence ( F | (the carrier of XY) ) = ( id XY ) by A3,FUNCT_1:2;
( Omega Y ) is  directed-sups-inheriting  full  directed-sups-inheriting  full (SubRelStr of ( Omega Z )) by A1,CKB26:1,WAYBEL25:17;
then (( oContMaps (X,Y9) ) is  directed-sups-inheriting  full non  empty  directed-sups-inheriting  full non  empty (SubRelStr of ( ( Omega Y ) |^ (the carrier of X) )) & ( ( Omega Y ) |^ (the carrier of X) ) is  directed-sups-inheriting  full  directed-sups-inheriting  full (SubRelStr of ( ( Omega Z ) |^ (the carrier of X) ))) by WAYBEL24:def 3,WAYBEL25:43,YELLOW16:39,YELLOW16:42;
then (( oContMaps (X,Z) ) is  directed-sups-inheriting  full non  empty  directed-sups-inheriting  full non  empty (SubRelStr of ( ( Omega Z ) |^ (the carrier of X) )) & ( oContMaps (X,Y) ) is  directed-sups-inheriting  full  directed-sups-inheriting  full (SubRelStr of ( ( Omega Z ) |^ (the carrier of X) ))) by WAYBEL24:def 3,WAYBEL25:43,YELLOW16:26,YELLOW16:27;
hence thesis by CKB25:1,YELLOW16:28;
