theorem
Th5: (for X being non  empty TopSpace holds (ex f being (Function of ( InclPoset (the topology of X) ),( oContMaps (X,( Sierpinski_Space )) )) st (f is  isomorphic & (for V being  open (Subset of X) holds ( f . V ) = ( chi (V,(the carrier of X)) )))))
proof
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
deffunc F(set) = ( chi ($1,(the carrier of X)) );
consider f being Function such that A1: ( dom f ) = (the topology of X) and A2: (for a being set holds (a in (the topology of X) implies ( f . a ) = F(a))) from FUNCT_1:sch 3;
A3: ( rng f ) c= (the carrier of ( oContMaps (X,( Sierpinski_Space )) ))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( rng f );
then consider a being set such that A4: a in ( dom f ) and A5: x = ( f . a ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider a as (Subset of X) by A1,A4;
a is  open by A1,A4,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then ( chi (a,(the carrier of X)) ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of X,( Sierpinski_Space )) by YELLOW16:46;
then x is  continuous  continuous (Function of X,( Sierpinski_Space )) by A1,A2,A4,A5;
then x is (Element of ( oContMaps (X,( Sierpinski_Space )) )) by CKB7:1;
hence thesis;
end;
set S = ( InclPoset (the topology of X) );
A6: (the carrier of ( InclPoset (the topology of X) )) = (the topology of X) by YELLOW_1:1;
then reconsider f as (Function of ( InclPoset (the topology of X) ),( oContMaps (X,( Sierpinski_Space )) )) by A1,A3,FUNCT_2:2;
A7:now
let x being (Element of S);
let y being (Element of S);
(x in (the topology of X) & y in (the topology of X)) by A6;
then reconsider V = x,W = y as  open (Subset of X) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
set cx = ( chi (V,(the carrier of X)) );
set cy = ( chi (W,(the carrier of X)) );
A8: (( f . x ) = cx & ( f . y ) = cy) by A2,A6;
cx is  continuous  continuous (Function of X,( Sierpinski_Space )) by YELLOW16:46;
then A9: cx is (Element of ( oContMaps (X,( Sierpinski_Space )) )) by CKB7:1;
cy is  continuous  continuous (Function of X,( Sierpinski_Space )) by YELLOW16:46;
then cy is (Element of ( oContMaps (X,( Sierpinski_Space )) )) by CKB7:1;
then reconsider cx,cy as  continuous (Function of X,( Omega ( Sierpinski_Space ) )) by A9,CKB6:1;
(x <= y iff V c= W) by YELLOW_1:3;
then (x <= y iff cx <= cy) by CKB11:1,YELLOW16:49;
hence (x <= y iff ( f . x ) <= ( f . y )) by A8,CKB8:1;
end;
set T = ( oContMaps (X,( Sierpinski_Space )) );
A10: ( rng f ) = (the carrier of T)
proof
(the topology of ( Sierpinski_Space )) = { ( {} ),{ 1 },{ ( 0 ),1 } } by WAYBEL18:def 9;
then { 1 } in (the topology of ( Sierpinski_Space )) by ENUMSET1:def 1;
then reconsider V = { 1 } as  open (Subset of ( Sierpinski_Space )) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
thus ( rng f ) c= (the carrier of T);
let t being set;
assume t in (the carrier of T);
then reconsider g = t as  continuous (Function of X,( Sierpinski_Space )) by CKB7:1;
( [#] ( Sierpinski_Space ) ) <> ( {} );
then A11: ( g " V ) is  open by TOPS_2:43;
then reconsider c = ( chi (( g " V ),(the carrier of X)) ) as (Function of X,( Sierpinski_Space )) by YELLOW16:46;
now
let x being (Element of X);
(x in ( g " V ) or (not x in ( g " V )));
then A12: ((( g . x ) in V & ( c . x ) = 1) or ((not ( g . x ) in V) & ( c . x ) = ( 0 ))) by FUNCT_2:38,FUNCT_3:def 3;
(the carrier of ( Sierpinski_Space )) = { ( 0 ),1 } by WAYBEL18:def 9;
then (( g . x ) = ( 0 ) or ( g . x ) = 1) by TARSKI:def 2;
hence ( g . x ) = ( c . x ) by A12,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
then A13: g = c by FUNCT_2:63;
A14: ( g " V ) in (the topology of X) by A11,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then ( f . ( g " V ) ) = ( chi (( g " V ),(the carrier of X)) ) by A2;
hence thesis by A1,A14,A13,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;
take f;
f is  one-to-one
proof
let x being (Element of S);
let y being (Element of S);
(x in (the topology of X) & y in (the topology of X)) by A6;
then reconsider V = x,W = y as (Subset of X);
(( f . x ) = ( chi (V,(the carrier of X)) ) & ( f . y ) = ( chi (W,(the carrier of X)) )) by A2,A6;
hence thesis by FUNCT_3:38;
end;
hence f is  isomorphic by A10,A7,WAYBEL_0:66;
let V being  open (Subset of X);
V in (the topology of X) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
hence thesis by A2;
