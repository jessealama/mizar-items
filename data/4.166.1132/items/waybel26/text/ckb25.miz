theorem
Th17: (for X,Z being non  empty TopSpace holds (for Y being non  empty (SubSpace of Z) holds ( oContMaps (X,Y) ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( oContMaps (X,Z) ))))
proof
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
let Z being non  empty TopSpace;
let Y being non  empty (SubSpace of Z);
set XY = ( oContMaps (X,Y) );
set XZ = ( oContMaps (X,Z) );
A1: ( Omega Y ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( Omega Z )) by WAYBEL25:17;
A2: ( [#] Y ) c= ( [#] Z ) by PRE_TOPC:def 4;
XY is (SubRelStr of XZ)
proof
thus A3: (the carrier of XY) c= (the carrier of XZ)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of XY);
then reconsider f = x as  continuous (Function of X,Y) by CKB7:1;
(( dom f ) = (the carrier of X) & ( rng f ) c= (the carrier of Z)) by A2,FUNCT_2:def 1,XBOOLE_1:1;
then x is  continuous  continuous (Function of X,Z) by FUNCT_2:2,PRE_TOPC:26;
then x is (Element of XZ) by CKB7:1;
hence thesis;
end;

let x being set;
let y being set;
assume A4: [ x,y ] in (the InternalRel of XY);
then A5: (x in (the carrier of XY) & y in (the carrier of XY)) by ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider x,y as (Element of XY) by A4,ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider a = x,b = y as (Element of XZ) by A3,A5;
reconsider f = x,g = y as  continuous (Function of X,( Omega Y )) by CKB6:1;
reconsider f9 = a,g9 = b as  continuous (Function of X,( Omega Z )) by CKB6:1;
x <= y by A4,ORDERS_2:def 5;
then f <= g by CKB8:1;
then f9 <= g9 by A1,YELLOW16:2;
then a <= b by CKB8:1;
hence thesis by ORDERS_2:def 5;
end;
then reconsider XY as non  empty (SubRelStr of XZ);
A6: ( (the InternalRel of XZ) |_2 (the carrier of XY) ) = ( (the InternalRel of XZ) /\ [: (the carrier of XY),(the carrier of XY) :] ) by WELLORD1:def 6;
(the InternalRel of XY) = (( (the InternalRel of XZ) |_2 (the carrier of XY) ) qua set)
proof
(the InternalRel of XY) c= (the InternalRel of XZ) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
hence (the InternalRel of XY) c= ( (the InternalRel of XZ) |_2 (the carrier of XY) ) by A6,XBOOLE_1:19;
let x being set;
let y being set;
assume A7: [ x,y ] in ( (the InternalRel of XZ) |_2 (the carrier of XY) );
then A8: [ x,y ] in [: (the carrier of XY),(the carrier of XY) :] by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A9: (x in (the carrier of XY) & y in (the carrier of XY)) by ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider x,y as (Element of XY) by A8,ZFMISC_1:87;
(the carrier of XY) c= (the carrier of XZ) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
then reconsider a = x,b = y as (Element of XZ) by A9;
reconsider f9 = a,g9 = b as  continuous (Function of X,( Omega Z )) by CKB6:1;
reconsider f = x,g = y as  continuous (Function of X,( Omega Y )) by CKB6:1;
[ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of XZ) by A6,A7,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then a <= b by ORDERS_2:def 5;
then f9 <= g9 by CKB8:1;
then f <= g by A1,YELLOW16:3;
then x <= y by CKB8:1;
hence thesis by ORDERS_2:def 5;
end;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:def 14;
