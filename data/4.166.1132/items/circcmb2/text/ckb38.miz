theorem
Th16: (for S1,S2,S being non  void  Circuit-like non  empty ManySortedSign holds ((( InputVertices S1 ) misses ( InnerVertices S2 ) & S = ( S1 +* S2 )) implies (for A1 being  non-empty (Circuit of S1) holds (for A2 being  non-empty (Circuit of S2) holds (for A being  non-empty (Circuit of S) holds ((A1 tolerates A2 & A = ( A1 +* A2 )) implies (for s being (State of A) holds (for s1 being (State of A1) holds ((s1 = ( s | (the carrier of S1) ) & s1 is  stable) implies (for s2 being (State of A2) holds (s2 = ( s | (the carrier of S2) ) implies ( ( Following s ) | (the carrier of S2) ) = ( Following s2 ))))))))))))
proof
let S1 being non  void  Circuit-like non  empty ManySortedSign;
let S2 being non  void  Circuit-like non  empty ManySortedSign;
let S being non  void  Circuit-like non  empty ManySortedSign;
assume that
A1: ( InputVertices S1 ) misses ( InnerVertices S2 )
and
A2: S = ( S1 +* S2 );
A3: (the carrier of S) = ( (the carrier of S1) \/ (the carrier of S2) ) by A2,CIRCCOMB:def 2;
let A1 being  non-empty (Circuit of S1);
let A2 being  non-empty (Circuit of S2);
let A being  non-empty (Circuit of S);
assume that
A4: A1 tolerates A2
and
A5: A = ( A1 +* A2 );
let s being (State of A);
let s1 being (State of A1);
assume that
A6: s1 = ( s | (the carrier of S1) )
and
A7: s1 is  stable;
let s2 being (State of A2);
assume that
A8: s2 = ( s | (the carrier of S2) );
A9:now
let a being set;
assume a in (the carrier of S2);
then reconsider v = a as (Vertex of S2);
reconsider vv = v as (Vertex of S) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
A10: ((v in ( InputVertices S2 ) & (not v in ( InnerVertices S1 ))) implies v in ( ( InputVertices S2 ) \ ( InnerVertices S1 ) )) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
A11: S1 tolerates S2 by A4,CIRCCOMB:def 3;
A12:now
assume that
A13: v in ( InputVertices S2 )
and
A14: v in ( InnerVertices S1 );
reconsider v1 = v as (Vertex of S1) by A14;
thus ( ( Following s ) . vv ) = ( ( Following s1 ) . vv ) by A2,A4,A5,A6,A14,CIRCCOMB:31
.= ( s1 . v ) by A7,CIRCUIT2:def 6
.= ( s . v1 ) by A6,FUNCT_1:49
.= ( s2 . v ) by A8,FUNCT_1:49
.= ( ( Following s2 ) . vv ) by A13,CIRCUIT2:def 5;
end;
((the carrier of S2) = ( ( InnerVertices S2 ) \/ ( InputVertices S2 ) ) & ( ( InputVertices S1 ) \ ( InnerVertices S2 ) ) = ( InputVertices S1 )) by A1,XBOOLE_1:45,XBOOLE_1:83;
then (v in ( InnerVertices S2 ) or ((v in ( InputVertices S2 ) & (v in ( InnerVertices S1 ) or (not v in ( InnerVertices S1 )))) & ( InputVertices S ) = ( ( InputVertices S1 ) \/ ( ( InputVertices S2 ) \ ( InnerVertices S1 ) ) ))) by A2,A11,CKB15:1,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then A15: ((vv in ( InnerVertices S2 ) or v in ( InputVertices S )) or (v in ( InputVertices S2 ) & v in ( InnerVertices S1 ))) by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
thus ( ( ( Following s ) | (the carrier of S2) ) . a ) = ( ( Following s ) . v ) by FUNCT_1:49
.= ( ( Following s2 ) . a ) by A2,A4,A5,A8,A12,A15,CIRCCOMB:31;
end;
( dom ( Following s ) ) = (the carrier of S) by CIRCUIT1:3;
then (( dom ( Following s2 ) ) = (the carrier of S2) & ( dom ( ( Following s ) | (the carrier of S2) ) ) = (the carrier of S2)) by A3,CIRCUIT1:3,RELAT_1:62,XBOOLE_1:7;
hence thesis by A9,FUNCT_1:2;
