proof
let S1 being non  void  Circuit-like non  empty ManySortedSign;
let S2 being non  void  Circuit-like non  empty ManySortedSign;
let S being non  void  Circuit-like non  empty ManySortedSign;
assume that
A1: ( InputVertices S1 ) misses ( InnerVertices S2 )
and
A2: S = ( S1 +* S2 );
let A1 being  non-empty (Circuit of S1);
let A2 being  non-empty (Circuit of S2);
let A being  non-empty (Circuit of S);
assume that
A3: A1 tolerates A2
and
A4: A = ( A1 +* A2 );
let n1 being Nat;
let n2 being Nat;
let s being (State of A);
let s9 being (State of A1);
let s99 being (State of A2);
assume that
A5: (s9 = ( s | (the carrier of S1) ) & ( Following (s9,n1) ) is  stable)
and
A6: (s99 = ( ( Following (s,n1) ) | (the carrier of S2) ) & ( Following (s99,n2) ) is  stable);
A7: (the Sorts of A1) tolerates (the Sorts of A2) by A3,CIRCCOMB:def 3;
then reconsider s1 = ( ( Following (s,n1) ) | (the carrier of S1) ),s0 = ( s | (the carrier of S1) ) as (State of A1) by A4,CIRCCOMB:26;
A8: ( Following (( Following (s,n1) ),n2) ) = ( Following (s,( n1 + n2 )) ) by FACIRC_1:13;
then A9: ( ( Following (s,( n1 + n2 )) ) | (the carrier of S1) ) = ( Following (s1,n2) ) by A1,A2,A3,A4,CKB36:1;
reconsider s2 = ( ( Following (s,n1) ) | (the carrier of S2) ) as (State of A2) by A4,A7,CIRCCOMB:26;
A10: ( dom ( Following (s,( n1 + n2 )) ) ) = (the carrier of S) by CIRCUIT1:3;
A11: (the carrier of S) = ( (the carrier of S1) \/ (the carrier of S2) ) by A2,CIRCCOMB:def 2;
A12: s1 = ( Following (s0,n1) ) by A1,A2,A3,A4,CKB36:1;
then A13: ( ( Following (s,( n1 + n2 )) ) | (the carrier of S2) ) = ( Following (s2,n2) ) by A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,A8,CKB41:1;
then ( Following ( Following (s,( n1 + n2 )) ) ) = ( ( Following ( Following (s2,n2) ) ) +* ( Following ( Following (s1,n2) ) ) ) by A1,A2,A3,A4,A9,CIRCCOMB:33
.= ( ( Following (s2,n2) ) +* ( Following ( Following (s1,n2) ) ) ) by A6,CIRCUIT2:def 6
.= ( ( Following (s2,n2) ) +* ( Following (s1,( n2 + 1 )) ) ) by FACIRC_1:12
.= ( ( Following (s2,n2) ) +* s1 ) by A5,A12,CKB4:1
.= ( ( Following (s2,n2) ) +* ( Following (s1,n2) ) ) by A5,A12,CKB4:1
.= ( Following (s,( n1 + n2 )) ) by A11,A10,A9,A13,FUNCT_4:70;
hence thesis by CIRCUIT2:def 6;
