theorem
Lm6: (for T1,T2 being non  empty TopSpace holds ((T1 is  T_2 & T2 is  T_2) implies [: T1,T2 :] is  T_2))
proof
let T1 being non  empty TopSpace;
let T2 being non  empty TopSpace;
assume that
A1: T1 is  T_2
and
A2: T2 is  T_2;
set T = [: T1,T2 :];
T is  T_2
proof
let p being (Point of T);
let q being (Point of T);
assume A3: p <> q;
q in (the carrier of T);
then q in [: (the carrier of T1),(the carrier of T2) :] by BORSUK_1:def 2;
then consider z,v being set such that A4: z in (the carrier of T1) and A5: v in (the carrier of T2) and A6: q = [ z,v ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
p in (the carrier of T);
then p in [: (the carrier of T1),(the carrier of T2) :] by BORSUK_1:def 2;
then consider x,y being set such that A7: x in (the carrier of T1) and A8: y in (the carrier of T2) and A9: p = [ x,y ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider y,v as (Point of T2) by A8,A5;
reconsider x,z as (Point of T1) by A7,A4;
per cases ;
suppose x <> z;

then consider Y,V being (Subset of T1) such that A10: (Y is  open & V is  open) and A11: (x in Y & z in V) and A12: Y misses V by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 10;
reconsider Y,V as (Subset of T1);
reconsider X = [: Y,( [#] T2 ) :],Z = [: V,( [#] T2 ) :] as (Subset of T);
A13: X misses Z by A12,ZFMISC_1:104;
A14: (X is  open & Z is  open) by A10,BORSUK_1:6;
(p in X & q in Z) by A8,A9,A5,A6,A11,ZFMISC_1:87;
hence thesis by A14,A13;
