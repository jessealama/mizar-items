theorem
Th13: (for I being non  empty set holds (for J being  RelStr-yielding  non-Empty  reflexive-yielding (ManySortedSet of I) holds ((for i being (Element of I) holds ( J . i ) is  Heyting  complete  Heyting  complete LATTICE) implies ( product J ) is  complete  Heyting)))
proof
let I being non  empty set;
let J being  RelStr-yielding  non-Empty  reflexive-yielding (ManySortedSet of I);
assume that
A1: (for i being (Element of I) holds ( J . i ) is  Heyting  complete  Heyting  complete LATTICE);
A2: (for i being (Element of I) holds ( J . i ) is  complete  complete LATTICE) by A1;
set H = ( product J );
reconsider H as  complete LATTICE by A2,WAYBEL_3:31;
H = H;
hence (( product J ) is  complete & ( product J ) is LATTICE);
let f being (Element of ( product J ));
reconsider g = f as (Element of H);
reconsider F = ( f "/\" ) as (Function of H,H);
A3: (for i being (Element of I) holds ( J . i ) is Semilattice) by A1;
F is  sups-preserving
proof
let X being (Subset of H);
reconsider Y = ( F .: X ),X9 = X as (Subset of ( product J ));
reconsider sX = ( sup X ) as (Element of ( product J ));
assume  ex_sup_of X,H;
thus  ex_sup_of ( F .: X ),H by YELLOW_0:17;
reconsider f1 = ( sup ( F .: X ) ),f2 = ( F . ( sup X ) ) as (Element of ( product J ));
A4:now
let x being set;
assume x in ( dom f1 );
then reconsider i = x as (Element of I) by WAYBEL_3:27;
A5: ( J . i ) is  complete  Heyting  complete  Heyting LATTICE by A1;

A7: ( ( ( f . i ) "/\" ) .: ( pi (X9,i) ) ) c= ( pi (Y,i) )
proof
let b being set;
assume b in ( ( ( f . i ) "/\" ) .: ( pi (X9,i) ) );

proof
let a being set;

hence thesis by A14,A18,FUNCT_2:35;
end;
then A19: ( pi (Y,i) ) = ( ( ( f . i ) "/\" ) .: ( pi (X9,i) ) ) by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
( ( f . i ) "/\" ) is  lower_adjoint by A5,WAYBEL_1:def 19;
