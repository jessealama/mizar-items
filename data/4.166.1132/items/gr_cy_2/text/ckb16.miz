theorem
Th21: (for Gc being  strict  finite  cyclic Group holds ( INT.Group ( card Gc ) ),Gc are_isomorphic )
proof
let Gc being  strict  finite  cyclic Group;
set n = ( card Gc );
consider g being (Element of Gc) such that A2: (for h being (Element of Gc) holds (ex p being Nat st h = ( g |^ p ))) by GR_CY_1:18;
(for h being (Element of Gc) holds (ex i st h = ( g |^ i )))
proof
let h being (Element of Gc);
consider p being Nat such that A3: h = ( g |^ p ) by A2;
reconsider p1 = p as Integer;
take p1;
thus thesis by A3;

proof
let j being (Element of ( INT.Group n )),j1 being (Element of ( INT.Group n ));
reconsider j9 = j,j19 = j1 as (Element of ( Segm n ));
( j * j1 ) = ( ( j + j1 ) mod n ) by GR_CY_1:def 4
