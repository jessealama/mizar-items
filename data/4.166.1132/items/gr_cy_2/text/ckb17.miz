theorem
(for Gc being  strict  cyclic Group holds (Gc is  infinite implies ( INT.Group ),Gc are_isomorphic ))
proof
let Gc being  strict  cyclic Group;
consider g being (Element of Gc) such that A1: (for h being (Element of Gc) holds (ex i st h = ( g |^ i ))) by GR_CY_1:17;
assume A2: Gc is  infinite;
(ex h being (Homomorphism of ( INT.Group ),Gc) st h is  bijective)
proof
deffunc F((Element of ( INT.Group ))) = ( g |^ ( @' $1 ) );
consider h being (Function of (the carrier of ( INT.Group )),(the carrier of Gc)) such that A3: (for j1 being (Element of ( INT.Group )) holds ( h . j1 ) = F(j1)) from FUNCT_2:sch 4;
A4: Gc = ( gr { g } ) by A1,CKB5:1;
A5: h is  one-to-one
proof
let x;
let y;
assume that
A6: x in ( dom h )
and
A7: y in ( dom h )
and
A8: ( h . x ) = ( h . y )
and
A9: x <> y;
reconsider y9 = y as (Element of ( INT.Group )) by A7,FUNCT_2:def 1;
reconsider x9 = x as (Element of ( INT.Group )) by A6,FUNCT_2:def 1;
( g |^ ( @' x9 ) ) = ( h . y9 ) by A3,A8
.= ( g |^ ( @' y9 ) ) by A3;
hence contradiction by A2,A4,A9,CKB14:1;
end;
A11: ( dom h ) = (the carrier of ( INT.Group )) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A12: (the carrier of Gc) c= ( rng h )
proof
let x;
assume x in (the carrier of Gc);
then reconsider z = x as (Element of Gc);
consider i such that A13: z = ( g |^ i ) by A1;
reconsider i9 = i as (Element of ( INT.Group )) by INT_1:def 2;
i = ( @' i9 );
then x = ( h . i9 ) by A3,A13;
hence thesis by A11,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;
( rng h ) c= (the carrier of Gc) by RELAT_1:def 19;
then A14: ( rng h ) = (the carrier of Gc) by A12,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
(for j holds (for j1 holds ( h . ( j * j1 ) ) = ( ( h . j ) * ( h . j1 ) )))
proof
let j;
let j1;
( @' ( j * j1 ) ) = ( ( @' j ) + ( @' j1 ) );
then ( h . ( j * j1 ) ) = ( g |^ ( ( @' j ) + ( @' j1 ) ) ) by A3
.= ( ( g |^ ( @' j ) ) * ( g |^ ( @' j1 ) ) ) by GROUP_1:33
.= ( ( h . j ) * ( g |^ ( @' j1 ) ) ) by A3
.= ( ( h . j ) * ( h . j1 ) ) by A3;
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider h as (Homomorphism of ( INT.Group ),Gc) by GROUP_6:def 6;
take h;
h is  onto by A14,FUNCT_2:def 3;
hence thesis by A5,FUNCT_2:def 4;
end;
hence thesis by GROUP_6:def 11;
end;
