theorem
Th24: (X is  locally_connected iff (for A being non  empty (Subset of X) holds (for B being (Subset of X) holds ((A is  open & B is_a_component_of A) implies B is  open))))
proof
thus (X is  locally_connected implies (for A being non  empty (Subset of X) holds (for B being (Subset of X) holds ((A is  open & B is_a_component_of A) implies B is  open))))
proof
assume A1: X is  locally_connected;
let A being non  empty (Subset of X);
let B being (Subset of X);
assume that
A2: A is  open
and
A3: B is_a_component_of A;
consider B1 being (Subset of ( X | A )) such that A4: B1 = B and A5: B1 is  a_component by A3,CONNSP_1:def 6;
reconsider B1 as (Subset of ( X | A ));
A is  locally_connected by A1,A2,CKB24:1;
then ( X | A ) is  locally_connected by CKB19:def 1;
then B1 is  open by A5,CKB22:1;
then B1 in (the topology of ( X | A )) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then consider B2 being (Subset of X) such that A6: B2 in (the topology of X) and A7: B1 = ( B2 /\ ( [#] ( X | A ) ) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 4;
A8: B = ( B2 /\ A ) by A4,A7,PRE_TOPC:def 5;
reconsider B2 as (Subset of X);
B2 is  open by A6,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
hence thesis by A2,A8;
end;

assume A9: (for A being non  empty (Subset of X) holds (for B being (Subset of X) holds ((A is  open & B is_a_component_of A) implies B is  open)));
let x;
(for U1 being non  empty (Subset of X) holds ((U1 is  open & x in U1) implies (ex x1 being (Point of ( X | U1 )) st (x1 = x & x in ( Int ( Component_of x1 ) )))))
proof
let U1 being non  empty (Subset of X);
assume that
A10: U1 is  open
and
A11: x in U1;
x in ( [#] ( X | U1 ) ) by A11,PRE_TOPC:def 5;
then reconsider x1 = x as (Point of ( X | U1 ));
set S1 = ( Component_of x1 );
reconsider S = S1 as (Subset of X) by PRE_TOPC:11;
S1 is  a_component by CONNSP_1:40;
then S is_a_component_of U1 by CONNSP_1:def 6;
then A12: S is  open by A9,A10;
take x1;
x in S by CONNSP_1:38;
then S1 is (a_neighborhood of x1) by A12,CKB5:1,CKB13:1;
hence thesis by CKB1:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB21:1;
