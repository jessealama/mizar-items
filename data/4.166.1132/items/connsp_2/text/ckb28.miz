theorem
((X is  locally_connected & X is  normal) implies (for A,B being (Subset of X) holds (((((A <> ( {} ) & B <> ( {} )) & A is  closed) & B is  closed) & A misses B) implies ((A is  connected & B is  connected) implies (ex R,S being (Subset of X) st ((((((R is  connected & S is  connected) & R is  open) & S is  open) & A c= R) & B c= S) & R misses S))))))
proof
assume that
A1: X is  locally_connected
and
A2: X is  normal;
let A being (Subset of X);
let B being (Subset of X);
assume that
A3: A <> ( {} )
and
A4: B <> ( {} )
and
A5: A is  closed
and
A6: (B is  closed & A misses B);
B = ( ( [#] X ) \ ( ( [#] X ) \ B ) ) by PRE_TOPC:3;
then A7: ( ( [#] X ) \ B ) <> ( [#] X ) by A4,PRE_TOPC:4;
A <> ( {} X ) by A3;
then consider x being (Point of X) such that A8: x in A by PRE_TOPC:12;
(A c= ( B ` ) & ( B ` ) is  open) by A6,SUBSET_1:23;
then consider G being (Subset of X) such that A9: G is  open and A10: A c= G and A11: ( Cl G ) c= ( B ` ) by A2,A3,A5,A7,CKB27:1;

then reconsider A1 = A as (Subset of ( X | G ));
A19: (H is  connected & y in H) by CONNSP_1:38;
A1 is  connected by A15,CONNSP_1:23;

take S = V1;
A25: V is  a_component by CONNSP_1:40;

A26: (V is  connected & z1 in V) by CONNSP_1:38;
B1 is  connected by A16,CONNSP_1:23;
then (B1 misses V or B1 c= V) by A25,CONNSP_1:36;
then A27: (( B1 /\ V ) = ( {} ) or B1 c= V) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
