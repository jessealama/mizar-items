reserve X for non empty TopSpace;
reserve x for (Point of X);
theorem
Th22: (X is_locally_connected_in x implies (for A being non empty (Subset of X) holds ((A is  open & x in A) implies A is_locally_connected_in x)))
proof
assume A1: X is_locally_connected_in x;
let A being non empty (Subset of X);
assume that
A2: A is  open
and
A3: x in A;
reconsider B = A as non empty (Subset of X);
A4: ( [#] ( X | A ) ) = A by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
(for C being non empty (Subset of X) holds (B = C implies (ex x1 being (Point of ( X | C )) st (x1 = x & ( X | C ) is_locally_connected_in x1))))
proof
let C being non empty (Subset of X);
assume A5: B = C;
then reconsider y = x as (Point of ( X | C )) by A3,A4;
take x1 = y;
(for U1 being (Subset of ( X | B )) holds (U1 is (a_neighborhood of x1) implies (ex V being (Subset of ( X | B )) st ((V is (a_neighborhood of x1) & V is  connected) & V c= U1))))
proof
let U1 being (Subset of ( X | B ));
assume that
A6: U1 is (a_neighborhood of x1);
reconsider U2 = U1 as (Subset of X) by PRE_TOPC:11;
U2 is (a_neighborhood of x) by A2,A5,A6,CKB11:1;
then consider V being (Subset of X) such that A7: (V is (a_neighborhood of x) & V is  connected) and A8: V c= U2 by A1,CKB16:def 1;
reconsider V1 = V as (Subset of ( X | B )) by A8,XBOOLE_1:1;
take V1;
thus thesis by A5,A7,A8,CKB13:1,CONNSP_1:23;
end;
hence thesis by A5,CKB16:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB18:def 1;
