reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
reserve x for (Point of X);
theorem
(for A,B being (Subset of X) holds ((A is (a_neighborhood of x) & B is (a_neighborhood of x)) iff ( A /\ B ) is (a_neighborhood of x)))
proof
let A being (Subset of X);
let B being (Subset of X);
((A is (a_neighborhood of x) & B is (a_neighborhood of x)) iff (x in ( Int A ) & x in ( Int B ))) by CKB1:def 1;
then ((A is (a_neighborhood of x) & B is (a_neighborhood of x)) iff x in ( ( Int A ) /\ ( Int B ) )) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then ((A is (a_neighborhood of x) & B is (a_neighborhood of x)) iff x in ( Int ( A /\ B ) )) by TOPS_1:17;
hence thesis by CKB1:def 1;
