reserve U1 for (Subset of X);
theorem
Th8: (U1 is (a_neighborhood of x) iff (ex V being (Subset of X) st ((V is  open & V c= U1) & x in V)))
proof
A1:now
assume U1 is (a_neighborhood of x);
then consider V being non  empty (Subset of X) such that A2: ((V is (a_neighborhood of x) & V is  open) & V c= U1) by CKB7:1;
take V;
thus (ex V being (Subset of X) st ((V is  open & V c= U1) & x in V)) by A2,CKB6:1;
end;
now
given V being (Subset of X) such that
A3: ((V is  open & V c= U1) & x in V);

x in ( Int U1 ) by A3,TOPS_1:22;
hence U1 is (a_neighborhood of x) by CKB1:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
