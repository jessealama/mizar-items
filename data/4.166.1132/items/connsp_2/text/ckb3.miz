reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
reserve x for (Point of X);
theorem
(for A,B being (Subset of X) holds ((A is (a_neighborhood of x) & B is (a_neighborhood of x)) implies ( A \/ B ) is (a_neighborhood of x)))
proof
let A being (Subset of X);
let B being (Subset of X);
reconsider A1 = A,B1 = B as (Subset of X);
((A1 is (a_neighborhood of x) & B1 is (a_neighborhood of x)) implies ( A1 \/ B1 ) is (a_neighborhood of x))
proof
assume that
A1: x in ( Int A1 )
and
x in ( Int B1 );
A2: ( ( Int A1 ) \/ ( Int B1 ) ) c= ( Int ( A1 \/ B1 ) ) by TOPS_1:20;
x in ( ( Int A1 ) \/ ( Int B1 ) ) by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence thesis by A2,CKB1:def 1;
end;
hence thesis;
