reserve X for non empty TopSpace;
reserve x for (Point of X);
theorem
(for U1 being (Subset of X) holds (U1 is  open iff (for x holds (x in U1 implies (ex A being (Subset of X) st (A is (a_neighborhood of x) & A c= U1))))))
proof
let U1 being (Subset of X);
now
assume A1: (for x holds (x in U1 implies (ex A being (Subset of X) st (A is (a_neighborhood of x) & A c= U1))));
(for x being set holds (x in U1 iff (ex V being (Subset of X) st ((V is  open & V c= U1) & x in V))))
proof
let x being set;
thus (x in U1 implies (ex V being (Subset of X) st ((V is  open & V c= U1) & x in V)))
proof
assume A2: x in U1;
then reconsider x as (Point of X);
consider S being (Subset of X) such that A3: S is (a_neighborhood of x) and A4: S c= U1 by A1,A2;
consider V being (Subset of X) such that A5: ((V is  open & V c= S) & x in V) by A3,CKB8:1;
take V;
thus thesis by A4,A5,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;

given V being (Subset of X) such that
V is  open
and
A6: (V c= U1 & x in V);

thus thesis by A6;
end;
hence U1 is  open by TOPS_1:25;
end;
hence thesis by CKB5:1;
end;
