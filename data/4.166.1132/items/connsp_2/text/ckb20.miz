theorem
Th19: (for x holds (X is_locally_connected_in x iff (for V,S being (Subset of X) holds (((V is (a_neighborhood of x) & S is_a_component_of V) & x in S) implies S is (a_neighborhood of x)))))
proof
let x;
thus (X is_locally_connected_in x implies (for V,S being (Subset of X) holds (((V is (a_neighborhood of x) & S is_a_component_of V) & x in S) implies S is (a_neighborhood of x))))
proof
assume A1: X is_locally_connected_in x;
let V being (Subset of X);
let S being (Subset of X);
assume that
A2: V is (a_neighborhood of x)
and
A3: S is_a_component_of V
and
A4: x in S;
reconsider V9 = V as non  empty (Subset of X) by A2,CKB6:1;
consider S1 being (Subset of ( X | V )) such that A5: S1 = S and A6: S1 is  a_component by A3,CONNSP_1:def 6;
consider V1 being (Subset of X) such that A7: V1 is (a_neighborhood of x) and A8: V1 is  connected and A9: V1 c= V by A1,A2,CKB16:def 1;
V1 c= ( [#] ( X | V ) ) by A9,PRE_TOPC:def 5;
then reconsider V2 = V1 as (Subset of ( X | V ));
A10: x in ( Int V1 ) by A7,CKB1:def 1;
V2 is  connected by A8,CONNSP_1:23;
then (V2 misses S1 or V2 c= S1) by A6,CONNSP_1:36;
then A11: (( V2 /\ S1 ) = ( {} ( X | V9 ) ) or V2 c= S1) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
x in V2 by A7,CKB6:1;
then ( Int V1 ) c= ( Int S ) by A4,A5,A11,TOPS_1:19,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by A10,CKB1:def 1;
end;

assume A12: (for V,S being (Subset of X) holds (((V is (a_neighborhood of x) & S is_a_component_of V) & x in S) implies S is (a_neighborhood of x)));
(for U1 being (Subset of X) holds (U1 is (a_neighborhood of x) implies (ex V being (Subset of X) st ((V is (a_neighborhood of x) & V is  connected) & V c= U1))))
proof
let U1 being (Subset of X);
A13: ( [#] ( X | U1 ) ) = U1 by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
assume A14: U1 is (a_neighborhood of x);
then A15: x in U1 by CKB6:1;
reconsider U1 as non  empty (Subset of X) by A14,CKB6:1;
x in ( [#] ( X | U1 ) ) by A15,PRE_TOPC:def 5;
then reconsider x1 = x as (Point of ( X | U1 ));
set S1 = ( Component_of x1 );
reconsider S = S1 as (Subset of X) by PRE_TOPC:11;
take S;
S1 is  a_component by CONNSP_1:40;
then A16: S is_a_component_of U1 by CONNSP_1:def 6;
(x in S & S1 is  connected) by CONNSP_1:38;
hence thesis by A12,A14,A13,A16,CONNSP_1:23;
end;
hence thesis by CKB16:def 1;
