reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
reserve x for (Point of X);
theorem
(X is  locally_connected implies (for E being non  empty (Subset of X) holds (for C being non  empty (Subset of ( X | E )) holds ((C is  connected & C is  open) implies (ex H being (Subset of X) st ((H is  open & H is  connected) & C = ( E /\ H )))))))
proof
assume A1: X is  locally_connected;
let E being non  empty (Subset of X);
let C being non  empty (Subset of ( X | E ));
assume that
A2: C is  connected
and
A3: C is  open;
C in (the topology of ( X | E )) by A3,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then consider G being (Subset of X) such that A4: G in (the topology of X) and A5: C = ( G /\ ( [#] ( X | E ) ) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 4;
A6: C = ( G /\ E ) by A5,PRE_TOPC:def 5;
reconsider G as non  empty (Subset of X) by A5;
A7: G is  open by A4,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
reconsider C1 = C as (Subset of X) by PRE_TOPC:11;
C <> ( {} ( X | E ) );
then consider x being (Point of ( X | E )) such that A8: x in C by PRE_TOPC:12;
x in G by A5,A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then x in ( [#] ( X | G ) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
then reconsider y = x as (Point of ( X | G ));
set H1 = ( Component_of y );
reconsider H = H1 as (Subset of X) by PRE_TOPC:11;
take H;
A9: H1 is  a_component by CONNSP_1:40;
then H is_a_component_of G by CONNSP_1:def 6;
hence H is  open by A1,A7,CKB25:1;
C c= G by A5,XBOOLE_1:17;
then C c= ( [#] ( X | G ) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
then reconsider C2 = C1 as (Subset of ( X | G ));
H1 c= ( [#] ( X | G ) );
then A10: H c= G by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
C1 is  connected by A2,CONNSP_1:23;
then C2 is  connected by CONNSP_1:23;
then (C2 misses H or C2 c= H) by A9,CONNSP_1:36;
then A11: (( C2 /\ H ) = ( {} ( X | G ) ) or C2 c= H) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
A12: x in H1 by CONNSP_1:38;
then ( H /\ ( G /\ E ) ) c= C by A6,A8,A11,XBOOLE_0:def 4,XBOOLE_1:28;
then ( ( H /\ G ) /\ E ) c= C by XBOOLE_1:16;
then A13: ( E /\ H ) c= C by A10,XBOOLE_1:28;
thus H is  connected by CONNSP_1:23;
C c= E by A6,XBOOLE_1:17;
then C c= ( E /\ H ) by A8,A11,A12,XBOOLE_0:def 4,XBOOLE_1:19;
hence thesis by A13,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
