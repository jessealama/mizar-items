begin
reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
reserve x for (Point of X);
theorem
( Component_of x ) c= ( qComponent_of x )
proof
consider F9 being (Subset-Family of X) such that A1: (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A in F9 iff (A is  open  closed & x in A))) and A2: ( qComponent_of x ) = ( meet F9 ) by CKB30:def 1;
A3: (for B1 being set holds (B1 in F9 implies ( Component_of x ) c= B1))
proof
set S = ( Component_of x );
let B1 being set;
A4: x in S by CONNSP_1:38;
assume A5: B1 in F9;
then reconsider B = B1 as (Subset of X);
A6: x in B by A1,A5;
A7: B is  open  closed by A1,A5;
then ( B ` ) is  closed;
then ( Cl ( B ` ) ) = ( B ` ) by PRE_TOPC:22;
then A8: B misses ( Cl ( B ` ) ) by XBOOLE_1:79;
A9: (( S /\ B ) c= B & ( S /\ ( B ` ) ) c= ( B ` )) by XBOOLE_1:17;
( Cl B ) = B by A7,PRE_TOPC:22;
then ( Cl B ) misses ( B ` ) by XBOOLE_1:79;
then B,( B ` ) are_separated  by A8,CONNSP_1:def 1;
then A10: ( S /\ B ),( S /\ ( B ` ) ) are_separated  by A9,CONNSP_1:7;
A11: ( [#] X ) = ( B \/ ( B ` ) ) by PRE_TOPC:2;
S = ( S /\ ( [#] X ) ) by XBOOLE_1:28
.= ( ( S /\ B ) \/ ( S /\ ( B ` ) ) ) by A11,XBOOLE_1:23;
then (( S /\ B ) = ( {} X ) or ( S /\ ( B ` ) ) = ( {} X )) by A10,CONNSP_1:15;
then S misses ( B ` ) by A6,A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then S c= ( ( B ` ) ` ) by SUBSET_1:23;
hence thesis;
end;
F9 <> ( {} ) by A1,CKB29:1;
hence thesis by A2,A3,SETFAM_1:5;
