reserve X for non empty TopSpace;
theorem
(for X1 being non empty (SubSpace of X) holds (for x being (Point of X) holds (for x1 being (Point of X1) holds (x = x1 implies ( Component_of x1 ) c= ( Component_of x )))))
proof
let X1 being non empty (SubSpace of X);
let x being (Point of X);
let x1 being (Point of X1);
consider F being (Subset-Family of X) such that A1: (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A in F iff (A is  connected & x in A))) and A2: ( union F ) = ( Component_of x ) by CONNSP_1:def 7;
reconsider Z = ( Component_of x1 ) as (Subset of X) by PRE_TOPC:11;
A3: (x1 in Z & Z is  connected) by CONNSP_1:23,CONNSP_1:38;
assume x = x1;
then Z in F by A1,A3;
hence thesis by A2,ZFMISC_1:74;
