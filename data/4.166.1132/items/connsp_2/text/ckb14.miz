reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
theorem
Th13: (for A being (Subset of X) holds (for B being (Subset of X) holds ((A is  a_component & A c= B) implies A is_a_component_of B)))
proof
let A being (Subset of X);
let B being (Subset of X);
assume that
A1: A is  a_component
and
A2: A c= B;
A3: A is  connected by A1;
(ex A1 being (Subset of ( X | B )) st (A = A1 & A1 is  a_component))
proof
B = ( [#] ( X | B ) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
then reconsider C = A as (Subset of ( X | B )) by A2;
take A1 = C;
A4: (for D being (Subset of ( X | B )) holds (D is  connected implies (A1 c= D implies A1 = D)))
proof
let D being (Subset of ( X | B ));
assume that
A5: D is  connected;
reconsider D1 = D as (Subset of X) by PRE_TOPC:11;
assume A6: A1 c= D;
D1 is  connected by A5,CONNSP_1:23;
hence thesis by A1,A6,CONNSP_1:def 5;
end;
A1 is  connected by A3,CONNSP_1:23;
hence thesis by A4,CONNSP_1:def 5;
end;
hence thesis by CONNSP_1:def 6;
