theorem
(for L being  continuous  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice holds ( SupMap L ) is  upper_adjoint)
proof
let L being  continuous  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice;
set P = ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) );
set r = ( SupMap L );
deffunc F((Element of L)) = ( inf ( r " ( uparrow { $1 } ) ) );
(ex d being (Function of L,( InclPoset ( Ids L ) )) st (for t being (Element of L) holds ( d . t ) = F(t))) from FUNCT_2:sch 4;
then consider d being (Function of L,( InclPoset ( Ids L ) )) such that A1: (for t being (Element of L) holds ( d . t ) = ( inf ( r " ( uparrow { t } ) ) ));
(for t being (Element of L) holds ( d . t ) is_minimum_of ( r " ( uparrow t ) ))
proof
let t being (Element of L);

I in (the carrier of P);
then I in ( Ids L ) by YELLOW_1:1;
then A3: I in ( dom r ) by YELLOW_2:49;
consider J being (Ideal of L) such that A4: t <= ( sup J ) and A5: (for K being (Ideal of L) holds (t <= ( sup K ) implies J c= K)) by CKB4:1;

A6: (for K being (Element of P) holds (( r " ( uparrow t ) ) is_>=_than K implies K <= J9))
proof
J9 in (the carrier of P);

then A7: J in ( dom r ) by YELLOW_2:49;
let K being (Element of P);
assume A8: ( r " ( uparrow t ) ) is_>=_than K;
t <= ( r . J9 ) by A4,YELLOW_2:def 3;
then ( r . J ) in ( uparrow t ) by WAYBEL_0:18;
then J in ( r " ( uparrow t ) ) by A7,FUNCT_1:def 7;
hence thesis by A8,LATTICE3:def 8;
end;
( r " ( uparrow t ) ) is_>=_than J9
proof
let K being (Element of P);
reconsider K9 = K as (Ideal of L) by YELLOW_2:41;
assume K in ( r " ( uparrow t ) );
then ( r . K ) in ( uparrow t ) by FUNCT_1:def 7;
then t <= ( r . K ) by WAYBEL_0:18;
then t <= ( sup K9 ) by YELLOW_2:def 3;
then J9 c= K9 by A5;
hence J9 <= K by YELLOW_1:3;
end;
then t <= ( sup I9 ) by A4,A6,YELLOW_0:31;
then t <= ( r . I ) by YELLOW_2:def 3;
then ( r . I ) in ( uparrow t ) by WAYBEL_0:18;
then ( ex_inf_of ( r " ( uparrow t ) ),( InclPoset ( Ids L ) ) & I in ( r " ( uparrow t ) )) by A3,FUNCT_1:def 7,YELLOW_0:17;
hence thesis by A2,WAYBEL_1:def 6;
end;
then [ r,d ] is  Galois by WAYBEL_1:10;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_1:def 11;
