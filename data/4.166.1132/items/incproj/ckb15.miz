theorem
Th13: (ex P st (p on P & q on P))
proof
reconsider p9 = p,q9 = q as (Point of CPS);
A1:now
consider r9 such that A2: p9 <> r9 by CKB13:1;
consider P9 being (LINE of CPS) such that A3: p9 in P9 and r9 in P9 by A2,COLLSP:15;
reconsider P = P9 as (LINE of ( IncProjSp_of CPS )) by CKB4:1;
assume A4: p9 = q9;
p on P by A3,CKB11:1;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
now
assume p9 <> q9;
then consider P9 being (LINE of CPS) such that A5: (p9 in P9 & q9 in P9) by COLLSP:15;
reconsider P = P9 as (LINE of ( IncProjSp_of CPS )) by CKB4:1;
(p on P & q on P) by A5,CKB11:1;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
