theorem
Th20: ((for p,p1,q,q1,r2 being (Point of CPS) holds (ex r,r1 being (Point of CPS) st ((p,q,r is_collinear  & p1,q1,r1 is_collinear ) & r2,r,r1 is_collinear ))) implies (for a holds (for M holds (for N holds (ex b st (ex c st (ex S st ((((a on S & b on S) & c on S) & b on M) & c on N))))))))
proof
assume A1: (for p,p1,q,q1,r2 being (Point of CPS) holds (ex r,r1 being (Point of CPS) st ((p,q,r is_collinear  & p1,q1,r1 is_collinear ) & r2,r,r1 is_collinear )));
let a;
let M;
let N;
reconsider M9 = M,N9 = N as (LINE of CPS) by CKB4:1;
reconsider a9 = a as (Point of CPS);
consider p being (Point of CPS),q being (Point of CPS) such that p <> q and A2: M9 = ( Line (p,q) ) by COLLSP:def 7;
consider p1 being (Point of CPS),q1 being (Point of CPS) such that p1 <> q1 and A3: N9 = ( Line (p1,q1) ) by COLLSP:def 7;
consider b9,c9 such that A4: p,q,b9 is_collinear  and A5: p1,q1,c9 is_collinear  and A6: a9,b9,c9 is_collinear  by A1;
reconsider b = b9,c = c9 as (POINT of ( IncProjSp_of CPS ));
b9 in M9 by A2,A4,COLLSP:11;
then A7: b on M by CKB11:1;
c9 in N9 by A3,A5,COLLSP:11;
then A8: c on N by CKB11:1;
(ex S st ((a on S & b on S) & c on S)) by A6,CKB16:1;
hence thesis by A7,A8;
