reserve CPS for CollProjectiveSpace;
reserve q for (POINT of ( IncProjSp_of CPS ));
reserve M for (LINE of ( IncProjSp_of CPS ));
reserve N for (LINE of ( IncProjSp_of CPS ));

theorem
Th18: ((for a9 holds (for b9 holds (for c9 holds (for d9 holds (ex p9 st (a9,b9,p9 is_collinear  & c9,d9,p9 is_collinear )))))) implies (for M holds (for N holds (ex q st (q on M & q on N)))))
proof
assume A1: (for a9 holds (for b9 holds (for c9 holds (for d9 holds (ex p9 st (a9,b9,p9 is_collinear  & c9,d9,p9 is_collinear ))))));
let M;
let N;
reconsider M9 = M,N9 = N as (LINE of CPS) by CKB4:1;
consider a9,b9 such that a9 <> b9 and A2: M9 = ( Line (a9,b9) ) by COLLSP:def 7;
consider c9,d9 such that c9 <> d9 and A3: N9 = ( Line (c9,d9) ) by COLLSP:def 7;
consider p9 such that A4: a9,b9,p9 is_collinear  and A5: c9,d9,p9 is_collinear  by A1;
reconsider q = p9 as (POINT of ( IncProjSp_of CPS ));
p9 in N9 by A3,A5,COLLSP:11;
then A6: q on N by CKB11:1;
p9 in M9 by A2,A4,COLLSP:11;
then q on M by CKB11:1;
hence thesis by A6;
