theorem
Th14: (((a = a9 & b = b9) & c = c9) implies (a9,b9,c9 is_collinear  iff (ex P st ((a on P & b on P) & c on P))))
proof
assume that
A1: a = a9
and
A2: b = b9
and
A3: c = c9;
hereby
assume A4: a9,b9,c9 is_collinear ;
A5:now
set X = ( Line (a9,b9) );
assume a9 <> b9;
then reconsider P9 = X as (LINE of CPS) by COLLSP:def 7;
reconsider P = P9 as (LINE of ( IncProjSp_of CPS )) by CKB4:1;
a9 in X by COLLSP:10;
then A6: a on P by A1,CKB11:1;
b9 in X by COLLSP:10;
then A7: b on P by A2,CKB11:1;
c9 in X by A4,COLLSP:11;
then c on P by A3,CKB11:1;
hence (ex P st ((a on P & b on P) & c on P)) by A6,A7;
end;
now
assume A8: a9 = b9;
(ex P st (b on P & c on P)) by CKB15:1;
hence (ex P st ((a on P & b on P) & c on P)) by A1,A2,A8;
end;
hence (ex P st ((a on P & b on P) & c on P)) by A5;
end;
given P such that
A9: (a on P & b on P)
and
A10: c on P;

reconsider P9 = P as (LINE of CPS) by CKB4:1;
A11: c9 in P9 by A3,A10,CKB11:1;
(a9 in P9 & b9 in P9) by A1,A2,A9,CKB11:1;
hence thesis by A11,COLLSP:16;
end;
