theorem
Th17: (((((((((((((a on M & b on M) & c on N) & d on N) & p on M) & p on N) & a on P) & c on P) & b on Q) & d on Q) & (not p on P)) & (not p on Q)) & M <> N) implies (ex q st (q on P & q on Q)))
proof
assume that
A1: a on M
and
A2: b on M
and
A3: c on N
and
A4: d on N
and
A5: (p on M & p on N)
and
A6: a on P
and
A7: c on P
and
A8: b on Q
and
A9: d on Q
and
A10: (not p on P)
and
A11: (not p on Q)
and
A12: M <> N;
reconsider a9 = a,b9 = b,c9 = c,d9 = d,p9 = p as (Point of CPS);
(b9,p9,a9 is_collinear  & p9,d9,c9 is_collinear ) by A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,CKB16:1;
then consider q9 such that A13: b9,d9,q9 is_collinear  and A14: a9,c9,q9 is_collinear  by ANPROJ_2:def 9;
reconsider q = q9 as (POINT of ( IncProjSp_of CPS ));
A15: (ex P2 being (LINE of ( IncProjSp_of CPS )) st ((b on P2 & d on P2) & q on P2)) by A13,CKB16:1;
b <> d by A2,A4,A5,A8,A11,A12,CKB14:1;
then A16: q on Q by A8,A9,A15,CKB14:1;
A17: (ex P1 being (LINE of ( IncProjSp_of CPS )) st ((a on P1 & c on P1) & q on P1)) by A14,CKB16:1;
a <> c by A1,A3,A5,A6,A10,A12,CKB14:1;
then q on P by A6,A7,A17,CKB14:1;
hence thesis by A16;
