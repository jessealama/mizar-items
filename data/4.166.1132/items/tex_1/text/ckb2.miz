begin
reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
reserve D for (Subset of X);
theorem
(for B being (Subset of X) holds (for C being (Subset of ( X modified_with_respect_to D )) holds (B = C implies (B is  closed implies C is  closed))))
proof
let B being (Subset of X);
let C being (Subset of ( X modified_with_respect_to D ));
assume A1: B = C;
A2: (the carrier of ( X modified_with_respect_to D )) = (the carrier of X) by TMAP_1:93;
assume B is  closed;
then ( C ` ) is  open by A1,A2,CKB1:1;
hence thesis by TOPS_1:3;
