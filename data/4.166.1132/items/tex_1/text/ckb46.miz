theorem
Th28: (for Y being non  empty TopSpace holds (( the TopStruct of Y ) = ( the TopStruct of ( STS (D,d0) ) ) iff ((the carrier of Y) = D & (for A being (Subset of Y) holds (({ d0 } c= A implies A is  closed) & ((A is non  empty & A is  closed) implies { d0 } c= A))))))
proof
let Y being non  empty TopSpace;
thus (( the TopStruct of Y ) = ( the TopStruct of ( STS (D,d0) ) ) implies ((the carrier of Y) = D & (for A being (Subset of Y) holds (({ d0 } c= A implies A is  closed) & ((A is non  empty & A is  closed) implies { d0 } c= A)))))
proof
assume A1: ( the TopStruct of Y ) = ( the TopStruct of ( STS (D,d0) ) );
hence (the carrier of Y) = D;
now
let A being (Subset of Y);
reconsider B = A as (Subset of ( STS (D,d0) )) by A1;
thus ({ d0 } c= A implies A is  closed)
proof
assume { d0 } c= A;
then B is  closed by CKB41:1;
hence thesis by A1,TOPS_3:79;
end;

thus ((A is non  empty & A is  closed) implies { d0 } c= A)
proof
assume A2: A is non  empty;
assume A is  closed;
then B is  closed by A1,TOPS_3:79;
hence thesis by A2,CKB41:1;
end;

end;
hence thesis;
end;

assume A3: (the carrier of Y) = D;
assume A4: (for A being (Subset of Y) holds (({ d0 } c= A implies A is  closed) & ((A is non  empty & A is  closed) implies { d0 } c= A)));
now
let A being (Subset of Y);
let C being (Subset of ( STS (D,d0) ));
assume A5: A = C;
A6:now
assume A7: C is  closed;
now
per cases ;
case C = ( {} );
hence A is  closed by A5;
end;
case C <> ( {} );
then { d0 } c= A by A5,A7,CKB41:1;
hence A is  closed by A4;
end;
end;
hence A is  closed;
end;
now
assume A8: A is  closed;
now
per cases ;
case A = ( {} );
hence C is  closed by A5;
end;
case A <> ( {} );
then { d0 } c= C by A4,A5,A8;
hence C is  closed by CKB41:1;
end;
end;
hence C is  closed;
end;
hence (A is  closed iff C is  closed) by A6;
end;
hence thesis by A3,TOPS_3:73;
