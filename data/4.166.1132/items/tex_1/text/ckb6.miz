theorem
Th6: (for C being (Subset of ( X modified_with_respect_to ( D ` ) )) holds (C = D implies (D is  boundary implies (C is  boundary & C is  closed))))
proof
let C being (Subset of ( X modified_with_respect_to ( D ` ) ));
assume C = D;
then A1: ( C ` ) = ( D ` ) by TMAP_1:93;
assume D is  boundary;
then A2: ( D ` ) is  dense by TOPS_1:def 4;
then A3: ( C ` ) is  open by A1,CKB4:1;
( C ` ) is  dense by A1,A2,CKB4:1;
hence thesis by A3,TOPS_1:3,TOPS_1:def 4;
