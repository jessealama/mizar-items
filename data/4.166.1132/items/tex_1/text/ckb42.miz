reserve D for non  empty set;
reserve d0 for (Element of D);
theorem
Th25: (( D \ { d0 } ) is non  empty implies (for A being (Subset of ( STS (D,d0) )) holds ((A = { d0 } implies (A is  closed & A is  boundary)) & (((A is non  empty & A is  closed) & A is  boundary) implies A = { d0 }))))
proof
assume A1: ( D \ { d0 } ) is non  empty;
set G = { P where P is (Subset of D): (d0 in P & P <> D) };
let A being (Subset of ( STS (D,d0) ));
A2: ( Int A ) in (the topology of ( STS (D,d0) )) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
thus (A = { d0 } implies (A is  closed & A is  boundary))
proof
assume A3: A = { d0 };
hence A is  closed by CKB41:1;
A4:now
assume A5: ( Int A ) = A;
then A6: d0 in ( Int A ) by A3,TARSKI:def 1;
( Int A ) <> D by A1,A3,A5,XBOOLE_1:37;
then ( Int A ) in G by A6;
hence contradiction by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
( Int A ) c= A by TOPS_1:16;
then (( Int A ) = ( {} ) or ( Int A ) = A) by A3,ZFMISC_1:33;
hence thesis by A4,TOPS_1:48;
end;

thus (((A is non  empty & A is  closed) & A is  boundary) implies A = { d0 })
proof
set Z = ( A \ { d0 } );
assume that
A7: A is non  empty
and
A8: A is  closed;
A9: { d0 } c= A by A7,A8,CKB41:1;
A10: Z c= A by XBOOLE_1:36;
reconsider Z as (Subset of ( STS (D,d0) ));
d0 in { d0 } by TARSKI:def 1;
then (not (ex Q being (Subset of D) st ((Q = Z & d0 in Q) & Q <> D))) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then (not Z in G);
then Z in (the topology of ( STS (D,d0) )) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then A11: Z is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
assume A is  boundary;
then A12: ( Int A ) = ( {} );
assume A13: A <> { d0 };
now
assume Z = ( {} );
then A c= { d0 } by XBOOLE_1:37;
hence contradiction by A9,A13,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
hence contradiction by A10,A12,A11,TOPS_1:24,XBOOLE_1:3;
end;
