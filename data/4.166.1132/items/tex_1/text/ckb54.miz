theorem
(X is  discrete iff (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A <> (the carrier of X) implies (not A is  dense))))
proof
hereby
assume A1: X is  discrete;
assume (not (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A <> (the carrier of X) implies (not A is  dense))));
then consider A being (Subset of X) such that A2: A <> (the carrier of X) and A3: A is  dense;
now
reconsider B = ( A ` ) as non  empty (Subset of X) by A2,TOPS_3:2;
take B;
thus B is  boundary by A3,TOPS_3:18;
end;
hence contradiction by A1,CKB53:def 1;
end;
assume A4: (for C being (Subset of X) holds (C <> (the carrier of X) implies (not C is  dense)));
assume X is non  discrete;
then consider A being non  empty (Subset of X) such that A5: A is  boundary by CKB53:def 1;
now
take B = ( A ` );
thus (B <> (the carrier of X) & B is  dense) by A5,TOPS_1:def 4,TOPS_3:1;
end;
hence contradiction by A4;
end;
