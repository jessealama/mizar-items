theorem
Th4: (for C being (Subset of ( X modified_with_respect_to D )) holds (C = D implies (D is  dense implies (C is  dense & C is  open))))
proof
let C being (Subset of ( X modified_with_respect_to D ));
assume A1: C = D;
set A = ( ( Cl C ) ` );
A in (the topology of ( X modified_with_respect_to D )) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then A in ( D -extension_of_the_topology_of X ) by TMAP_1:93;
then A2: A in { ( H \/ ( G /\ D ) ) where H is (Subset of X),G is (Subset of X): (H in (the topology of X) & G in (the topology of X)) } by TMAP_1:def 7;
reconsider B = A as (Subset of X) by TMAP_1:93;
consider H,G being (Subset of X) such that A3: A = ( H \/ ( G /\ D ) ) and A4: H in (the topology of X) and G in (the topology of X) by A2;
A5: H c= A by A3,XBOOLE_1:7;
A6: C c= ( Cl C ) by PRE_TOPC:18;
then D misses A by A1,SUBSET_1:24;
then ( G /\ D ) misses A by XBOOLE_1:17,XBOOLE_1:63;
then A7: ( ( G /\ D ) /\ A ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
A = ( ( H \/ ( G /\ D ) ) /\ A ) by A3
.= ( ( H /\ A ) \/ ( {} ) ) by A7,XBOOLE_1:23
.= ( H /\ A );
then A c= H by XBOOLE_1:17;
then B = H by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then A8: B is  open by A4,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
D misses B by A1,A6,SUBSET_1:24;
then ( Cl D ) misses B by A8,TSEP_1:36;
then A9: ( ( Cl D ) /\ B ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
assume D is  dense;
then A10: ( Cl D ) = ( [#] X ) by TOPS_1:def 3;
thus C is  dense
proof
assume (not C is  dense);
then ( Cl C ) <> ( [#] ( X modified_with_respect_to D ) ) by TOPS_1:def 3;
then B <> ( {} ( X modified_with_respect_to D ) ) by TOPS_3:2;
hence contradiction by A9,A10,XBOOLE_1:28;
end;

thus thesis by A1,TMAP_1:94;
