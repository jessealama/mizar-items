theorem
(for Y being 1 -element TopStruct holds ((the topology of Y) is non  empty implies (Y is  almost_discrete implies Y is  TopSpace-like)))
proof
let Y being 1 -element TopStruct;
consider d being (Element of Y) such that A1: (the carrier of Y) = { d } by CKB9:def 1;
reconsider D = { d } as (Subset of Y);
assume (the topology of Y) is non  empty;
then consider A being (Subset of Y) such that A2: A in (the topology of Y) by SUBSET_1:4;
assume A3: (for A being (Subset of Y) holds (A in (the topology of Y) implies ( (the carrier of Y) \ A ) in (the topology of Y)));
A4: ( bool D ) = { ( {} ),D } by ZFMISC_1:24;
now
per cases  by A1,A4,TARSKI:def 2;
suppose A5: A = ( {} );

( D \ A ) in (the topology of Y) by A1,A2,A3;
hence { ( {} ),D } c= (the topology of Y) by A2,A5,ZFMISC_1:32;
end;
suppose A6: A = D;

( D \ A ) in (the topology of Y) by A1,A2,A3;
then ( {} ) in (the topology of Y) by A6,XBOOLE_1:37;
hence { ( {} ),D } c= (the topology of Y) by A2,A6,ZFMISC_1:32;
end;
end;
then (the topology of Y) = { ( {} ),(the carrier of Y) } by A1,A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then reconsider Y as  anti-discrete TopStruct by TDLAT_3:def 2;
Y is  TopSpace-like;
hence thesis;
end;
