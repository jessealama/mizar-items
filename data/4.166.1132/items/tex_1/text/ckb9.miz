definition
let Y being non  empty 1-sorted;
redefine attr Y is  trivial
means
:Def1: (ex d being (Element of Y) st (the carrier of Y) = { d });
compatibility
proof
hereby
assume A1: Y is  trivial;
thus (ex d being (Element of Y) st (the carrier of Y) = { d })
proof
reconsider A = (the carrier of Y) as (Subset of Y) by CKB8:1;
set d = the (Element of Y);
reconsider D = { d } as (Subset of Y);
take d;
now
let a being (Element of Y);
assume a in A;
a = d by A1,STRUCT_0:def 10;
hence a in D by TARSKI:def 1;
end;
then A c= D by SUBSET_1:2;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;

end;
given d being (Element of Y) such that
A2: (the carrier of Y) = { d };

now
let a being (Element of Y);
let b being (Element of Y);
a = d by A2,TARSKI:def 1;
hence a = b by A2,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by STRUCT_0:def 10;
end;
