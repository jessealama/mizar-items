theorem
(for Y being non  empty TopSpace holds (( the TopStruct of Y ) = ( the TopStruct of ( STS (D,d0) ) ) iff ((the carrier of Y) = D & (for A being (Subset of Y) holds (A <> D implies ( Int A ) = ( A \ { d0 } ))))))
proof
let Y being non  empty TopSpace;
thus (( the TopStruct of Y ) = ( the TopStruct of ( STS (D,d0) ) ) implies ((the carrier of Y) = D & (for A being (Subset of Y) holds (A <> D implies ( Int A ) = ( A \ { d0 } )))))
proof
assume A1: ( the TopStruct of Y ) = ( the TopStruct of ( STS (D,d0) ) );
hence (the carrier of Y) = D;
reconsider P = { d0 } as (Subset of Y) by A1;
now
let A being (Subset of Y);
reconsider B = A as (Subset of Y);
A2: A = ( A /\ D ) by A1,XBOOLE_1:28;
assume A3: A <> D;
now
assume ( Int A ) = D;
then D c= A by TOPS_1:16;
hence contradiction by A1,A3,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
then A4: ( Int A ) c= ( D \ P ) by A1,CKB47:1;
( A \ { d0 } ) c= ( D \ { d0 } ) by A1,XBOOLE_1:33;
then ( B \ P ) is  open by A1,CKB47:1;
then ( Int ( A \ P ) ) = ( A \ P ) by TOPS_1:23;
then A5: ( A \ { d0 } ) c= ( Int A ) by TOPS_1:19,XBOOLE_1:36;
( Int A ) c= A by TOPS_1:16;
then ( Int A ) c= ( A /\ ( D \ P ) ) by A4,XBOOLE_1:19;
then ( Int A ) c= ( A \ { d0 } ) by A2,XBOOLE_1:49;
hence ( Int A ) = ( A \ { d0 } ) by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
hence thesis;
end;

assume A6: (the carrier of Y) = D;
assume A7: (for A being (Subset of Y) holds (A <> D implies ( Int A ) = ( A \ { d0 } )));
now
let A being (Subset of Y);
thus (A c= ( D \ { d0 } ) implies A is  open)
proof
assume A8: A c= ( D \ { d0 } );
A9:now
( D /\ { d0 } ) = { d0 } by ZFMISC_1:46;
then A10: D meets { d0 } by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
assume A = D;
then D = ( D \ { d0 } ) by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence contradiction by A10,XBOOLE_1:83;
end;
A11: A = ( A /\ D ) by A6,XBOOLE_1:28;
A = ( A /\ ( D \ { d0 } ) ) by A8,XBOOLE_1:28;
then A = ( A \ { d0 } ) by A11,XBOOLE_1:49;
then ( Int A ) = A by A7,A9;
hence thesis;
end;

thus ((A <> D & A is  open) implies A c= ( D \ { d0 } ))
proof
assume A12: A <> D;
assume A is  open;
then ( Int A ) = A by TOPS_1:23;
then ( A \ { d0 } ) = A by A7,A12;
hence thesis by A6,XBOOLE_1:33;
end;

end;
hence thesis by A6,CKB47:1;
