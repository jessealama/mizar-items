begin
reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
reserve D for (Subset of X);
theorem
Th1: (for B being (Subset of X) holds (for C being (Subset of ( X modified_with_respect_to D )) holds (B = C implies (B is  open implies C is  open))))
proof
let B being (Subset of X);
let C being (Subset of ( X modified_with_respect_to D ));
assume A1: B = C;
A2: (the topology of X) c= ( D -extension_of_the_topology_of X ) by TMAP_1:88;
A3: (the topology of ( X modified_with_respect_to D )) = ( D -extension_of_the_topology_of X ) by TMAP_1:93;
assume B in (the topology of X);
hence thesis by A1,A2,A3,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
