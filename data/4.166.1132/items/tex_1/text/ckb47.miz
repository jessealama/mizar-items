theorem
Th29: (for Y being non  empty TopSpace holds (( the TopStruct of Y ) = ( the TopStruct of ( STS (D,d0) ) ) iff ((the carrier of Y) = D & (for A being (Subset of Y) holds ((A c= ( D \ { d0 } ) implies A is  open) & ((A <> D & A is  open) implies A c= ( D \ { d0 } )))))))
proof
let Y being non  empty TopSpace;
thus (( the TopStruct of Y ) = ( the TopStruct of ( STS (D,d0) ) ) implies ((the carrier of Y) = D & (for A being (Subset of Y) holds ((A c= ( D \ { d0 } ) implies A is  open) & ((A <> D & A is  open) implies A c= ( D \ { d0 } ))))))
proof
assume A1: ( the TopStruct of Y ) = ( the TopStruct of ( STS (D,d0) ) );
hence (the carrier of Y) = D;
let A being (Subset of Y);
reconsider B = A as (Subset of ( STS (D,d0) )) by A1;
thus (A c= ( D \ { d0 } ) implies A is  open)
proof
assume A c= ( D \ { d0 } );
then B is  open by CKB43:1;
hence thesis by A1,TOPS_3:76;
end;

thus ((A <> D & A is  open) implies A c= ( D \ { d0 } ))
proof
assume A2: A <> D;
assume A is  open;
then B is  open by A1,TOPS_3:76;
hence thesis by A2,CKB43:1;
end;

end;

assume A3: (the carrier of Y) = D;
assume A4: (for A being (Subset of Y) holds ((A c= ( D \ { d0 } ) implies A is  open) & ((A <> D & A is  open) implies A c= ( D \ { d0 } ))));
now
let A being (Subset of Y);
let C being (Subset of ( STS (D,d0) ));
assume A5: A = C;

assume A7: A is  open;
now
per cases ;
case A = D;
then C = ( [#] ( STS (D,d0) ) ) by A5;
hence C is  open;
end;
case A <> D;
then A c= ( D \ { d0 } ) by A4,A7;
hence C is  open by A5,CKB43:1;
end;
end;
hence C is  open;
end;
now
assume A8: C is  open;
now
per cases ;
case C = D;
then A = ( [#] Y ) by A3,A5;
hence A is  open;
end;
case C <> D;
then A c= ( D \ { d0 } ) by A5,A8,CKB43:1;
hence A is  open by A4;
end;
end;
hence A is  open;
end;
hence (A is  open iff C is  open) by A6;

hence thesis by A3,TOPS_3:72;
