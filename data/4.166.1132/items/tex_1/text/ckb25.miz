begin
reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
theorem
Th12: (for X being  anti-discrete non  empty TopSpace holds (for A being (Subset of X) holds ((A <> (the carrier of X) implies ( Int A ) = ( {} )) & (A = (the carrier of X) implies ( Int A ) = (the carrier of X)))))
proof
let X being  anti-discrete non  empty TopSpace;
let A being (Subset of X);
thus (A <> (the carrier of X) implies ( Int A ) = ( {} ))
proof
assume A1: A <> (the carrier of X);
now
assume ( Int A ) = (the carrier of X);
then (the carrier of X) c= A by TOPS_1:16;
hence contradiction by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
hence thesis by TDLAT_3:18;
end;

thus (A = (the carrier of X) implies ( Int A ) = (the carrier of X))
proof
assume A = (the carrier of X);
then A = ( [#] X );
hence thesis by TOPS_1:15;
end;

end;
