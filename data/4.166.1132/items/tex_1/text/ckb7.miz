theorem
Th7: (for C being (Subset of ( X modified_with_respect_to ( D ` ) )) holds (C c= D implies (D is  boundary implies C is  nowhere_dense)))
proof
let C being (Subset of ( X modified_with_respect_to ( D ` ) ));
assume A1: C c= D;
reconsider E = D as (Subset of ( X modified_with_respect_to ( D ` ) )) by TMAP_1:93;
assume A2: D is  boundary;
then A3: E is  closed by CKB6:1;
E is  boundary by A2,CKB6:1;
hence thesis by A1,A3,TOPS_3:26;
