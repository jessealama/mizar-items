theorem
Th22: (for C being  compact (Subset of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) holds (p in ( BDD C ) implies (((( North-Bound (p,C) ) in C & ( North-Bound (p,C) ) in ( north_halfline p )) & ( South-Bound (p,C) ) in C) & ( South-Bound (p,C) ) in ( south_halfline p ))))
proof
let C being  compact (Subset of ( TOP-REAL 2 ));
A1: C is  Bounded by JORDAN2C:65;
set X = ( C /\ ( north_halfline p ) );
X c= C by XBOOLE_1:17;
then ( ( proj2 ) .: X ) is  bounded by A1,JCT_MISC:14,JORDAN2C:12;
then A2: ( ( proj2 ) .: X ) is  bounded_below by XXREAL_2:def 11;
assume A3: p in ( BDD C );
then (not ( north_halfline p ) c= ( UBD C )) by CKB22:1;
then ( north_halfline p ) meets C by JORDAN2C:129;
then A4: X is non  empty by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
X is  Bounded by A1,JORDAN2C:12,XBOOLE_1:17;
then ( ( proj2 ) .: X ) is  closed by JCT_MISC:13;
then ( lower_bound ( ( proj2 ) .: X ) ) in ( ( proj2 ) .: X ) by A4,A2,CKB2:1,RCOMP_1:13,RELAT_1:119;
then consider x being set such that A5: x in (the carrier of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) and A6: x in X and A7: ( lower_bound ( ( proj2 ) .: X ) ) = ( ( proj2 ) . x ) by FUNCT_2:64;
reconsider x as (Point of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) by A5;
A8: ( x `2 ) = ( lower_bound ( ( proj2 ) .: X ) ) by A7,PSCOMP_1:def 6
.= ( ( North-Bound (p,C) ) `2 ) by EUCLID:52;
x in ( north_halfline p ) by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then ( x `1 ) = ( p `1 ) by TOPREAL1:def 10
.= ( ( North-Bound (p,C) ) `1 ) by EUCLID:52;
then x = ( North-Bound (p,C) ) by A8,TOPREAL3:6;
hence (( North-Bound (p,C) ) in C & ( North-Bound (p,C) ) in ( north_halfline p )) by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
set X = ( C /\ ( south_halfline p ) );
X c= C by XBOOLE_1:17;
then ( ( proj2 ) .: X ) is  bounded by A1,JCT_MISC:14,JORDAN2C:12;
then A9: ( ( proj2 ) .: X ) is  bounded_above by XXREAL_2:def 11;
(not ( south_halfline p ) c= ( UBD C )) by A3,CKB23:1;
then ( south_halfline p ) meets C by JORDAN2C:128;
then A10: X is non  empty by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
X is  Bounded by A1,JORDAN2C:12,XBOOLE_1:17;
then ( ( proj2 ) .: X ) is  closed by JCT_MISC:13;
then ( upper_bound ( ( proj2 ) .: X ) ) in ( ( proj2 ) .: X ) by A10,A9,CKB2:1,RCOMP_1:12,RELAT_1:119;
then consider x being set such that A11: x in (the carrier of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) and A12: x in X and A13: ( upper_bound ( ( proj2 ) .: X ) ) = ( ( proj2 ) . x ) by FUNCT_2:64;
reconsider x as (Point of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) by A11;
x in ( south_halfline p ) by A12,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A14: ( x `1 ) = ( p `1 ) by TOPREAL1:def 12
.= ( ( South-Bound (p,C) ) `1 ) by EUCLID:52;
( x `2 ) = ( upper_bound ( ( proj2 ) .: X ) ) by A13,PSCOMP_1:def 6
.= ( ( South-Bound (p,C) ) `2 ) by EUCLID:52;
then x = ( South-Bound (p,C) ) by A14,TOPREAL3:6;
hence thesis by A12,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
