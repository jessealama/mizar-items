theorem
(for C being  compact (Subset of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) holds (p in ( BDD C ) implies ( ( LSeg (( North-Bound (p,C) ),( South-Bound (p,C) )) ) /\ C ) = { ( North-Bound (p,C) ),( South-Bound (p,C) ) }))
proof
let C being  compact (Subset of ( TOP-REAL 2 ));
set L = ( LSeg (( North-Bound (p,C) ),( South-Bound (p,C) )) );
assume A1: p in ( BDD C );
then A2: (( North-Bound (p,C) ) in C & ( South-Bound (p,C) ) in C) by CKB30:1;
hereby
A3: ( ( North-Bound (p,C) ) `2 ) = ( lower_bound ( ( proj2 ) .: ( C /\ ( north_halfline p ) ) ) ) by EUCLID:52;
A4: ( ( South-Bound (p,C) ) `2 ) = ( upper_bound ( ( proj2 ) .: ( C /\ ( south_halfline p ) ) ) ) by EUCLID:52;
let x being set;
A5: ( ( South-Bound (p,C) ) `1 ) = ( p `1 ) by EUCLID:52;
assume A6: x in ( L /\ C );
then reconsider y = x as (Point of ( TOP-REAL 2 ));
A7: x in L by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
(L is  vertical & ( South-Bound (p,C) ) in L) by CKB34:1,RLTOPSP1:68;
then A8: ( y `1 ) = ( p `1 ) by A5,A7,SPPOL_1:def 3;
A9: x in C by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A10: ( ( North-Bound (p,C) ) `1 ) = ( p `1 ) by EUCLID:52;
now
A11: C is  Bounded by JORDAN2C:65;
then ( C /\ ( north_halfline p ) ) is  Bounded by TOPREAL6:89;
then ( ( proj2 ) .: ( C /\ ( north_halfline p ) ) ) is  bounded by JCT_MISC:14;
then A12: ( ( proj2 ) .: ( C /\ ( north_halfline p ) ) ) is  bounded_below by XXREAL_2:def 11;
(( ( South-Bound (p,C) ) `2 ) < ( p `2 ) & ( p `2 ) < ( ( North-Bound (p,C) ) `2 )) by A1,CKB31:1;
then A13: ( ( South-Bound (p,C) ) `2 ) < ( ( North-Bound (p,C) ) `2 ) by XXREAL_0:2;
then A14: ( ( South-Bound (p,C) ) `2 ) <= ( y `2 ) by A7,TOPREAL1:4;
assume y <> ( North-Bound (p,C) );
then A15: ( y `2 ) <> ( ( North-Bound (p,C) ) `2 ) by A10,A8,TOPREAL3:6;
A16: ( y `2 ) = ( ( proj2 ) . y ) by PSCOMP_1:def 6;
( y `2 ) <= ( ( North-Bound (p,C) ) `2 ) by A7,A13,TOPREAL1:4;
then A17: ( y `2 ) < ( ( North-Bound (p,C) ) `2 ) by A15,XXREAL_0:1;
now
assume ( y `2 ) > ( p `2 );
then y in ( north_halfline p ) by A8,TOPREAL1:def 10;
then y in ( C /\ ( north_halfline p ) ) by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then ( y `2 ) in ( ( proj2 ) .: ( C /\ ( north_halfline p ) ) ) by A16,FUNCT_2:35;
hence contradiction by A3,A17,A12,SEQ_4:def 2;
end;
then y in ( south_halfline p ) by A8,TOPREAL1:def 12;
then y in ( C /\ ( south_halfline p ) ) by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A18: ( y `2 ) in ( ( proj2 ) .: ( C /\ ( south_halfline p ) ) ) by A16,FUNCT_2:35;
( C /\ ( south_halfline p ) ) is  Bounded by A11,TOPREAL6:89;
then ( ( proj2 ) .: ( C /\ ( south_halfline p ) ) ) is  bounded by JCT_MISC:14;
then ( ( proj2 ) .: ( C /\ ( south_halfline p ) ) ) is  bounded_above by XXREAL_2:def 11;
then ( y `2 ) <= ( ( South-Bound (p,C) ) `2 ) by A4,A18,SEQ_4:def 1;
then ( y `2 ) = ( ( South-Bound (p,C) ) `2 ) by A14,XXREAL_0:1;
hence y = ( South-Bound (p,C) ) by A5,A8,TOPREAL3:6;
end;
hence x in { ( North-Bound (p,C) ),( South-Bound (p,C) ) } by TARSKI:def 2;
end;
let x being set;
assume x in { ( North-Bound (p,C) ),( South-Bound (p,C) ) };
then A19: (x = ( North-Bound (p,C) ) or x = ( South-Bound (p,C) )) by TARSKI:def 2;
then x in L by RLTOPSP1:68;
hence thesis by A19,A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
