func the_set_of_l1RealSequences -> (Subset of ( Linear_Space_of_RealSequences )) means 
:Def1: (for x being set holds (x in it iff (x in ( the_set_of_RealSequences ) & ( seq_id x ) is  absolutely_summable)));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
( seq_id $1 ) is  absolutely_summable;
consider IT being set such that A1: (for x being set holds (x in IT iff (x in ( the_set_of_RealSequences ) & P[ x ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
(for x being set holds (x in IT implies x in ( the_set_of_RealSequences ))) by A1;
then IT is (Subset of ( the_set_of_RealSequences )) by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis by A1,RSSPACE:def 7;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let X1 being (Subset of ( Linear_Space_of_RealSequences ));
let X2 being (Subset of ( Linear_Space_of_RealSequences ));
assume that
A2: (for x being set holds (x in X1 iff (x in ( the_set_of_RealSequences ) & ( seq_id x ) is  absolutely_summable)))
and
A3: (for x being set holds (x in X2 iff (x in ( the_set_of_RealSequences ) & ( seq_id x ) is  absolutely_summable)));
(for x being set holds (x in X2 implies x in X1))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in X2;
then (x in ( the_set_of_RealSequences ) & ( seq_id x ) is  absolutely_summable) by A3;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
then A4: X2 c= X1 by TARSKI:def 3;
(for x being set holds (x in X1 implies x in X2))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in X1;
then (x in ( the_set_of_RealSequences ) & ( seq_id x ) is  absolutely_summable) by A2;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
then X1 c= X2 by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
