reserve x for set;
definition
let A being set;
func Fin A ->  preBoolean set
means
:Def5: (for X being set holds (X in it iff (X c= A & X is  finite)));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex y being set st ((y = $1 & y c= A) & y is  finite));
consider P being set such that A1: (for x holds (x in P iff (x in ( bool A ) & P[ x ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
( {} ) c= A by XBOOLE_1:2;
then reconsider Q = P as non empty set by A1;
(for X,Y being set holds ((X in Q & Y in Q) implies (( X \/ Y ) in Q & ( X \ Y ) in Q)))
proof
let X being set,Y being set;
assume that
A2: X in Q
and
A3: Y in Q;
consider Z1 being set such that A4: Z1 = X and A5: Z1 c= A and A6: Z1 is  finite by A1,A2;
consider Z2 being set such that A7: Z2 = Y and A8: Z2 c= A and A9: Z2 is  finite by A1,A3;
A10: ( Z1 \ Z2 ) c= A by A5,XBOOLE_1:1;
( Z1 \/ Z2 ) c= A by A5,A8,XBOOLE_1:8;
hence thesis by A1,A4,A6,A7,A9,A10;
end;
then reconsider R = Q as non empty  preBoolean set by CKB8:1;
(for X being set holds (X in R iff (X c= A & X is  finite)))
proof
let X being set;
thus (X in R implies (X c= A & X is  finite))
proof
assume X in R;
then (ex Y being set st ((Y = X & Y c= A) & Y is  finite)) by A1;
hence thesis;
end;

thus thesis by A1;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let P being  preBoolean set,Q being  preBoolean set;
assume that
A11: (for X being set holds (X in P iff (X c= A & X is  finite)))
and
A12: (for X being set holds (X in Q iff (X c= A & X is  finite)));
(for x being set holds (x in P iff x in Q))
proof
let x;
thus (x in P implies x in Q)
proof
assume x in P;
then (x c= A & x is  finite) by A11;
hence thesis by A12;
end;

thus (x in Q implies x in P)
proof
assume x in Q;
then (x c= A & x is  finite) by A12;
hence thesis by A11;
end;

end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
