definition
func ternaryreal -> (TriOp of ( REAL )) means 
:Def4: (for a,b,c being Real holds ( it . (a,b,c) ) = ( ( a * b ) + c ));
existence
proof
deffunc F(Real,Real,Real) = ( ( $1 * $2 ) + $3 );
(ex X being (TriOp of ( REAL )) st (for a,b,c being Real holds ( X . (a,b,c) ) = F(a,b,c))) from MULTOP_1:sch 4;
hence thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let o1 being (TriOp of ( REAL ));
let o2 being (TriOp of ( REAL ));
assume that
A1: (for a,b,c being Real holds ( o1 . (a,b,c) ) = ( ( a * b ) + c ))
and
A2: (for a,b,c being Real holds ( o2 . (a,b,c) ) = ( ( a * b ) + c ));
(for a,b,c being Real holds ( o1 . (a,b,c) ) = ( o2 . (a,b,c) ))
proof
let a being Real;
let b being Real;
let c being Real;
thus ( o1 . (a,b,c) ) = ( ( a * b ) + c ) by A1
.= ( o2 . (a,b,c) ) by A2;
end;
hence thesis by MULTOP_1:3;
end;
