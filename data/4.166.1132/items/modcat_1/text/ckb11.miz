func Morphs (G,H) -> (LModMorphism_DOMAIN of G,H) means 
:Def4: (x in it iff x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H));
existence
proof
( ZeroMap (G,H) ) is (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of G),(the carrier of H)) )) by FUNCT_2:8;
then reconsider f0 = ( ZeroMap (G,H) ) as (Element of ( Maps (G,H) )) by GRCAT_1:def 21;
set D = { LModMorphismStr (# G,H,f #) where f is (Element of ( Maps (G,H) )): f is  additive  homogeneous };
LModMorphismStr (# G,H,f0 #) in D;
then reconsider D as non  empty set;
A1: (x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H) implies x in D)
proof
assume x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H);
then reconsider x as  strict (Morphism of G,H);
( dom x ) = G by MOD_2:def 8;
then A2: (the Dom of x) = G by MOD_2:def 3;
A3: ( cod x ) = H by MOD_2:def 8;
then (the Cod of x) = H by MOD_2:def 4;
then reconsider f = (the Fun of x) as (Function of G,H) by A2;
f is (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of G),(the carrier of H)) )) by FUNCT_2:8;
then reconsider g = f as (Element of ( Maps (G,H) )) by GRCAT_1:def 21;
((the Fun of x) is  additive  homogeneous & x = LModMorphismStr (# G,H,g #)) by A3,A2,MOD_2:4,MOD_2:def 4;
hence thesis;
end;
A4: (x in D implies x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H))
proof
assume x in D;
then (ex f being (Element of ( Maps (G,H) )) st (x = LModMorphismStr (# G,H,f #) & f is  additive  homogeneous));
hence thesis by MOD_2:6;
end;
then (for x being (Element of D) holds x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H));
then reconsider D as (LModMorphism_DOMAIN of G,H) by CKB9:1;
take D;
thus thesis by A4,A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let D1 being (LModMorphism_DOMAIN of G,H);
let D2 being (LModMorphism_DOMAIN of G,H);
assume that
A5: (x in D1 iff x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H))
and
A6: (x in D2 iff x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H));
(x in D1 iff x in D2)
proof
hereby
assume x in D1;
then x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H) by A5;
hence x in D2 by A6;
end;
assume x in D2;
then x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H) by A6;
hence thesis by A5;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
