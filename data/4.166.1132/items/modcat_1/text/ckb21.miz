definition
let R;
let V;
func Morphs V -> (LModMorphism_DOMAIN of R) means 
:Def7: (for x holds (x in it iff (ex G,H being  strict (Element of V) st x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H))));
existence
proof
set G0 = the  strict (Element of V);
set M = ( Morphs (G0,G0) );
set S = { ( Morphs (G,H) ) where G is  strict (Element of V),H is  strict (Element of V): (not contradiction) };
(( ZERO (G0,G0) ) is (Element of M) & M in S) by CKB11:def 1;
then reconsider T = ( union S ) as non  empty set by TARSKI:def 4;
A1: (for x holds (x in T iff (ex G,H being  strict (Element of V) st x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H))))
proof
let x;
thus (x in T implies (ex G,H being  strict (Element of V) st x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H)))
proof
assume x in T;
then consider Y being set such that A2: x in Y and A3: Y in S by TARSKI:def 4;
consider G,H being  strict (Element of V) such that A4: Y = ( Morphs (G,H) ) by A3;
take G;
take H;
thus thesis by A2,A4,CKB11:def 1;
end;

thus ((ex G,H being  strict (Element of V) st x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H)) implies x in T)
proof
given G being  strict (Element of V),H being  strict (Element of V) such that
A5: x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H);

set M = ( Morphs (G,H) );
A6: M in S;
x in M by A5,CKB11:def 1;
hence thesis by A6,TARSKI:def 4;
end;

end;
now
let x being (Element of T);
(ex G,H being  strict (Element of V) st x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H)) by A1;
hence x is  strict  strict (LModMorphism of R);
end;
then reconsider T9 = T as (LModMorphism_DOMAIN of R) by CKB4:def 1;
take T9;
thus thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let D1 being (LModMorphism_DOMAIN of R);
let D2 being (LModMorphism_DOMAIN of R);
assume that
A7: (for x holds (x in D1 iff (ex G,H being  strict (Element of V) st x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H))))
and
A8: (for x holds (x in D2 iff (ex G,H being  strict (Element of V) st x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H))));
now
let x;
(x in D1 iff (ex G,H being  strict (Element of V) st x is  strict  strict (Morphism of G,H))) by A7;
hence (x in D1 iff x in D2) by A8;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
