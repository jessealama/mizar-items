theorem
Th21: (for V,X,Y being RealUnitarySpace holds ((V is (Subspace of X) & X is (Subspace of Y)) implies V is (Subspace of Y)))
proof
let V being RealUnitarySpace,X being RealUnitarySpace,Y being RealUnitarySpace;
assume that
A1: V is (Subspace of X)
and
A2: X is (Subspace of Y);
((the carrier of V) c= (the carrier of X) & (the carrier of X) c= (the carrier of Y)) by A1,A2,CKB1:def 1;
hence (the carrier of V) c= (the carrier of Y) by XBOOLE_1:1;
( 0. V ) = ( 0. X ) by A1,CKB1:def 1;
hence ( 0. V ) = ( 0. Y ) by A2,CKB1:def 1;
thus (the addF of V) = ( (the addF of Y) || (the carrier of V) )
proof
set AY = (the addF of Y);
set VX = (the carrier of X);
set AX = (the addF of X);
set VV = (the carrier of V);
set AV = (the addF of V);
VV c= VX by A1,CKB1:def 1;
then A3: [: VV,VV :] c= [: VX,VX :] by ZFMISC_1:96;
AV = ( AX || VV ) by A1,CKB1:def 1;
then AV = ( ( AY || VX ) || VV ) by A2,CKB1:def 1;
hence thesis by A3,FUNCT_1:51;
end;

thus (the Mult of V) = ( (the Mult of Y) | [: ( REAL ),(the carrier of V) :] )
proof
set MY = (the Mult of Y);
set VX = (the carrier of X);
set MX = (the Mult of X);
set VV = (the carrier of V);
set MV = (the Mult of V);
VV c= VX by A1,CKB1:def 1;
then A4: [: ( REAL ),VV :] c= [: ( REAL ),VX :] by ZFMISC_1:95;
MV = ( MX | [: ( REAL ),VV :] ) by A1,CKB1:def 1;
then MV = ( ( MY | [: ( REAL ),VX :] ) | [: ( REAL ),VV :] ) by A2,CKB1:def 1;
hence thesis by A4,FUNCT_1:51;
end;

set SY = (the scalar of Y);
set SX = (the scalar of X);
set SV = (the scalar of V);
set VX = (the carrier of X);
set VV = (the carrier of V);
VV c= VX by A1,CKB1:def 1;
then A5: [: VV,VV :] c= [: VX,VX :] by ZFMISC_1:96;
SV = ( SX || VV ) by A1,CKB1:def 1;
then SV = ( ( SY || VX ) || VV ) by A2,CKB1:def 1;
hence thesis by A5,FUNCT_1:51;
end;
