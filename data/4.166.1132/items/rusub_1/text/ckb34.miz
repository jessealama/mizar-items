let V being RealUnitarySpace;
func (Omega). V ->  strict (Subspace of V)
equals
( the UNITSTR of V );
coherence
proof
set W = ( the UNITSTR of V );
A1: (for u,v,w being (VECTOR of W) holds ( ( u + v ) + w ) = ( u + ( v + w ) ))
proof
let u being (VECTOR of W),v being (VECTOR of W),w being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider u9 = u,v9 = v,w9 = w as (VECTOR of V);
thus ( ( u + v ) + w ) = ( ( u9 + v9 ) + w9 )
.= ( u9 + ( v9 + w9 ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 3
.= ( u + ( v + w ) );
end;
A2: (for v being (VECTOR of W) holds ( v + ( 0. W ) ) = v)
proof
let v being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider v9 = v as (VECTOR of V);
thus ( v + ( 0. W ) ) = ( v9 + ( 0. V ) )
.= v by RLVECT_1:4;
end;
A3: W is  right_complementable
proof
let v being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider v9 = v as (VECTOR of V);
consider w9 being (VECTOR of V) such that A4: ( v9 + w9 ) = ( 0. V ) by ALGSTR_0:def 11;
reconsider w = w9 as (VECTOR of W);
take w;
thus thesis by A4;
end;
A5: (for v being (VECTOR of W) holds ( 1 * v ) = v)
proof
let v being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider v9 = v as (VECTOR of V);
thus ( 1 * v ) = ( 1 * v9 )
.= v by RLVECT_1:def 8;
end;
A6: (for a,b being  real number holds (for v being (VECTOR of W) holds ( ( a + b ) * v ) = ( ( a * v ) + ( b * v ) )))
proof
let a being  real number,b being  real number;
let v being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider v9 = v as (VECTOR of V);
thus ( ( a + b ) * v ) = ( ( a + b ) * v9 )
.= ( ( a * v9 ) + ( b * v9 ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 6
.= ( ( a * v ) + ( b * v ) );
end;
A7: (for a being  real number holds (for v,w being (VECTOR of W) holds ( a * ( v + w ) ) = ( ( a * v ) + ( a * w ) )))
proof
let a being  real number;
let v being (VECTOR of W),w being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider v9 = v,w9 = w as (VECTOR of V);
thus ( a * ( v + w ) ) = ( a * ( v9 + w9 ) )
.= ( ( a * v9 ) + ( a * w9 ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 5
.= ( ( a * v ) + ( a * w ) );
end;
A8:now
let a being Real;
let v being (VECTOR of W),w being (VECTOR of W);
let v9 being (VECTOR of V),w9 being (VECTOR of V);
assume that
A9: v = v9
and
A10: w = w9;
thus ( v + w ) = ( v9 + w9 ) by A9,A10;
thus ( a * v ) = ( a * v9 ) by A9;
thus ( v .|. w ) = ( (the scalar of W) . [ v,w ] ) by BHSP_1:def 1
.= ( v9 .|. w9 ) by A9,A10,BHSP_1:def 1;
end;
A11: (for v,w being (VECTOR of W) holds ( v + w ) = ( w + v ))
proof
let v being (VECTOR of W),w being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider v9 = v,w9 = w as (VECTOR of V);
thus ( v + w ) = ( w9 + v9 ) by A8
.= ( w + v );
end;
A12: ( 0. W ) = ( 0. V );
A13: (for x,y,z being (VECTOR of W) holds (for a being Real holds (((((( x .|. x ) = ( 0 ) iff x = ( 0. W )) & ( 0 ) <= ( x .|. x )) & ( x .|. y ) = ( y .|. x )) & ( ( x + y ) .|. z ) = ( ( x .|. z ) + ( y .|. z ) )) & ( ( a * x ) .|. y ) = ( a * ( x .|. y ) ))))
proof
let x being (VECTOR of W),y being (VECTOR of W),z being (VECTOR of W);
let a being Real;
reconsider x9 = x as (VECTOR of V);
reconsider y9 = y as (VECTOR of V);
reconsider z9 = z as (VECTOR of V);
A14: ( ( x + y ) .|. z ) = ( ( x9 + y9 ) .|. z9 ) by A8
.= ( ( x9 .|. z9 ) + ( y9 .|. z9 ) ) by BHSP_1:def 2;
( x9 .|. x9 ) = ( x .|. x ) by A8;
hence (( x .|. x ) = ( 0 ) iff x = ( 0. W )) by A12,BHSP_1:def 2;
( x9 .|. x9 ) = ( x .|. x ) by A8;
hence ( 0 ) <= ( x .|. x ) by BHSP_1:def 2;
( x9 .|. y9 ) = ( x .|. y ) by A8;
hence ( x .|. y ) = ( y .|. x ) by A8;
( x9 .|. z9 ) = ( x .|. z ) by A8;
hence ( ( x + y ) .|. z ) = ( ( x .|. z ) + ( y .|. z ) ) by A8,A14;
( ( a * x ) .|. y ) = ( ( a * x9 ) .|. y9 ) by A8
.= ( a * ( x9 .|. y9 ) ) by BHSP_1:def 2;
hence ( ( a * x ) .|. y ) = ( a * ( x .|. y ) ) by A8;
end;
(for a,b being  real number holds (for v being (VECTOR of W) holds ( ( a * b ) * v ) = ( a * ( b * v ) )))
proof
let a being  real number,b being  real number;
let v being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider v9 = v as (VECTOR of V);
thus ( ( a * b ) * v ) = ( ( a * b ) * v9 )
.= ( a * ( b * v9 ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 7
.= ( a * ( b * v ) );
end;
then reconsider W as RealUnitarySpace by A11,A1,A2,A3,A7,A6,A5,A13,BHSP_1:def 2,RLVECT_1:def 2,RLVECT_1:def 3,RLVECT_1:def 4,RLVECT_1:def 5,RLVECT_1:def 6,RLVECT_1:def 7,RLVECT_1:def 8;
A15: ((the scalar of W) = ( (the scalar of V) || (the carrier of W) ) & (the addF of W) = ( (the addF of V) || (the carrier of W) )) by RELSET_1:19;
