let T being TopStruct;
let P being (Subset of T);
let F being (Subset-Family of T);
func F | P -> (Subset-Family of ( T | P ))
means
:Def3: (for Q being (Subset of ( T | P )) holds (Q in it iff (ex R being (Subset of T) st (R in F & ( R /\ P ) = Q))));
existence
proof
thus (ex G being (Subset-Family of ( T | P )) st (for Q being (Subset of ( T | P )) holds (Q in G iff (ex R being (Subset of T) st (R in F & ( R /\ P ) = Q)))))
proof
defpred X[ (Subset of ( T | P )) ]
 means
(ex R being (Subset of T) st (R in F & ( R /\ P ) = $1));
(ex G being (Subset-Family of ( T | P )) st (for Q being (Subset of ( T | P )) holds (Q in G iff X[ Q ]))) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;

uniqueness
proof
thus (for G,H being (Subset-Family of ( T | P )) holds (((for Q being (Subset of ( T | P )) holds (Q in G iff (ex R being (Subset of T) st (R in F & ( R /\ P ) = Q)))) & (for Q being (Subset of ( T | P )) holds (Q in H iff (ex R being (Subset of T) st (R in F & ( R /\ P ) = Q))))) implies G = H))
proof
let G being (Subset-Family of ( T | P )),H being (Subset-Family of ( T | P ));
assume that
A1: (for Q being (Subset of ( T | P )) holds (Q in G iff (ex R being (Subset of T) st (R in F & ( R /\ P ) = Q))))
and
A2: (for Q being (Subset of ( T | P )) holds (Q in H iff (ex R being (Subset of T) st (R in F & ( R /\ P ) = Q))));
(x in G iff x in H)
proof
hereby
assume A3: x in G;
then reconsider X = x as (Subset of ( T | P ));
(ex R being (Subset of T) st (R in F & ( R /\ P ) = X)) by A1,A3;
hence x in H by A2;
end;
assume A4: x in H;
then reconsider X = x as (Subset of ( T | P ));
(ex R being (Subset of T) st (R in F & ( R /\ P ) = X)) by A2,A4;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
