Th27: ((W is  open & W is  finite) implies ( meet W ) is  open)
proof
assume that
A1: W is  open
and
A2: W is  finite;
consider p being FinSequence such that A3: ( rng p ) = W by A2,FINSEQ_1:52;
consider n being Nat such that A4: ( dom p ) = ( Seg n ) by FINSEQ_1:def 2;
defpred X[ Nat ]
 means
(for Z holds (((Z = ( p .: ( Seg $1 ) ) & $1 <= n) & 1 <= n) implies ( meet Z ) is  open));
A5: (for k being Nat holds (X[ k ] implies X[ ( k + 1 ) ]))
proof
