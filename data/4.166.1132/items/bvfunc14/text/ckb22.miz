theorem
(for z,u being (Element of Y) holds (for h being Function holds ((((((((G is  independent & G = { A,B,C,D }) & A <> B) & A <> C) & A <> D) & B <> C) & B <> D) & C <> D) implies ( EqClass (u,( ( B '/\' C ) '/\' D )) ) meets ( EqClass (z,A) ))))
proof
let z being (Element of Y);
let u being (Element of Y);
let h being Function;
assume that
A1: G is  independent
and
A2: G = { A,B,C,D }
and
A3: (((((A <> B & A <> C) & A <> D) & B <> C) & B <> D) & C <> D);

proof
let t being set;
assume A8: t in ( rng h );
per cases  by A7,A8,ENUMSET1:def 2;

then t = ( EqClass (z,A) ) by FUNCT_7:94;
hence thesis;
