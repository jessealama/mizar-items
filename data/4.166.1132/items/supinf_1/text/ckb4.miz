definition
let X being  ext-real-membered set;
func SetMajorant X ->  ext-real-membered set means 
:Def14: (for x being  ext-real number holds (x in it iff x is (UpperBound of X)));
existence
proof
defpred P[  ext-real number ]
 means
$1 is (UpperBound of X);
consider Y being  ext-real-membered set such that A1: (for x being  ext-real number holds (x in Y iff P[ x ])) from MEMBERED:sch 2;
take Y;
thus thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let Y1 being  ext-real-membered set;
let Y2 being  ext-real-membered set;
assume that
A2: (for x being  ext-real number holds (x in Y1 iff x is (UpperBound of X)))
and
A3: (for x being  ext-real number holds (x in Y2 iff x is (UpperBound of X)));
let x being  ext-real number;
(x in Y1 iff x is (UpperBound of X)) by A2;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
