func 1_minus h -> (Membership_Func of C)
means
:Def6: (for c being (Element of C) holds ( it . c ) = ( 1 - ( h . c ) ));
existence
proof
deffunc F(set) = ( 1 - ( h . $1 ) );
defpred P[ set ]
 means
$1 in ( dom h );
consider IT being (PartFunc of C,( REAL )) such that A1: ((for x being (Element of C) holds (x in ( dom IT ) iff P[ x ])) & (for x being (Element of C) holds (x in ( dom IT ) implies ( IT . x ) = F(x)))) from SEQ_1:sch 3;
(for x being set holds (x in C implies x in ( dom IT )))
proof
let x being set;
A2: ( dom h ) = C by FUNCT_2:def 1;
assume x in C;
hence thesis by A1,A2;
end;
then C c= ( dom IT ) by TARSKI:def 3;

(for y being set holds (y in ( rng IT ) implies y in [. ( 0 ),1 .]))
proof
reconsider A = [. ( 0 ),1 .] as non empty  closed_interval (Subset of ( REAL )) by MEASURE5:14;
let y being set;
assume y in ( rng IT );
then consider x being (Element of C) such that A6: x in ( dom IT ) and A7: y = ( IT . x ) by PARTFUN1:3;
A8: A = [. ( lower_bound A ),( upper_bound A ) .] by INTEGRA1:4;

hence thesis by A4;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let F being (Membership_Func of C),G being (Membership_Func of C);
assume that
A14: (for c being (Element of C) holds ( F . c ) = ( 1 - ( h . c ) ))
and
A15: (for c being (Element of C) holds ( G . c ) = ( 1 - ( h . c ) ));
A16: (for c being (Element of C) holds (c in C implies ( F . c ) = ( G . c )))
proof
let c being (Element of C);
( F . c ) = ( 1 - ( h . c ) ) by A14;
hence thesis by A15;
end;
(C = ( dom F ) & C = ( dom G )) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence thesis by A16,PARTFUN1:5;
end;
involutiveness
proof
let h1 being (Membership_Func of C),h2 being (Membership_Func of C);
assume A17: (for c being (Element of C) holds ( h1 . c ) = ( 1 - ( h2 . c ) ));
let c being (Element of C);
thus ( h2 . c ) = ( 1 - ( 1 - ( h2 . c ) ) )
.= ( 1 - ( h1 . c ) ) by A17;
