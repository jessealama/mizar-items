definition
let X being set;
let A being (Subset-Family of X);
func UniCl A -> (Subset-Family of X) means 
:Def1: (for x being (Subset of X) holds (x in it iff (ex Y being (Subset-Family of X) st (Y c= A & x = ( union Y )))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex Y being (Subset-Family of X) st (Y c= A & $1 = ( union Y )));
(ex Z being (Subset-Family of X) st (for x being (Subset of X) holds (x in Z iff P[ x ]))) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
hence thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let F1 being (Subset-Family of X);
let F2 being (Subset-Family of X);
assume that
A1: (for x being (Subset of X) holds (x in F1 iff (ex Y being (Subset-Family of X) st (Y c= A & x = ( union Y )))))
and
A2: (for x being (Subset of X) holds (x in F2 iff (ex Y being (Subset-Family of X) st (Y c= A & x = ( union Y )))));
now
let x being (Subset of X);
(x in F1 iff (ex Y being (Subset-Family of X) st (Y c= A & x = ( union Y )))) by A1;
hence (x in F1 iff x in F2) by A2;
end;
hence thesis by SUBSET_1:3;
