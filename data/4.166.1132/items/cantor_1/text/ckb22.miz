theorem
Th17: (for X being non  empty set holds (for A being (Subset-Family of X) holds TopStruct (# X,( UniCl ( FinMeetCl A ) ) #) is  TopSpace-like))
proof
let X being non  empty set;
let A being (Subset-Family of X);
set T = TopStruct (# X,( UniCl ( FinMeetCl A ) ) #);
A1: ( [#] T ) in ( FinMeetCl A ) by CKB14:1;
now
reconsider Y = { ( [#] T ) } as (Subset-Family of X) by ZFMISC_1:68;
reconsider Y as (Subset-Family of X);
take Y;
thus Y c= ( FinMeetCl A ) by A1,ZFMISC_1:31;
thus ( [#] T ) = ( union Y ) by ZFMISC_1:25;
end;
hence (the carrier of T) in (the topology of T) by CKB1:def 1;
thus (for a being (Subset-Family of T) holds (a c= (the topology of T) implies ( union a ) in (the topology of T)))
proof
let a being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A2: a c= (the topology of T);
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex c being (Subset of T) st (c in a & c = ( union $1 )));
consider b being (Subset-Family of ( FinMeetCl A )) such that A3: (for B being (Subset of ( FinMeetCl A )) holds (B in b iff P[ B ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
A4: a = { ( union B ) where B is (Subset of ( FinMeetCl A )): B in b }
proof
set gh = { ( union B ) where B is (Subset of ( FinMeetCl A )): B in b };
hereby
let x being set;
assume A5: x in a;
then reconsider x9 = x as (Subset of X);
consider V being (Subset-Family of X) such that A6: V c= ( FinMeetCl A ) and A7: x9 = ( union V ) by A2,A5,CKB1:def 1;
V in b by A3,A5,A6,A7;
hence x in gh by A7;
end;
let x being set;
assume x in gh;
then consider B being (Subset of ( FinMeetCl A )) such that A8: x = ( union B ) and A9: B in b;
(ex c being (Subset of T) st (c in a & c = ( union B ))) by A3,A9;
hence thesis by A8;
end;
(( union ( union b ) ) = ( union { ( union B ) where B is (Subset of ( FinMeetCl A )): B in b } ) & ( union b ) c= ( bool X )) by EQREL_1:54,XBOOLE_1:1;
hence thesis by A4,CKB1:def 1;
end;

let a being (Subset of T);
let b being (Subset of T);
assume a in (the topology of T);
then consider F being (Subset-Family of X) such that A10: F c= ( FinMeetCl A ) and A11: a = ( union F ) by CKB1:def 1;
assume b in (the topology of T);
then consider G being (Subset-Family of X) such that A12: G c= ( FinMeetCl A ) and A13: b = ( union G ) by CKB1:def 1;
A14: ( union ( INTERSECTION (F,G) ) ) = ( a /\ b ) by A11,A13,SETFAM_1:28;
A15: ( INTERSECTION (F,G) ) c= ( FinMeetCl A ) by A10,A12,CKB19:1;
then ( INTERSECTION (F,G) ) is (Subset-Family of X) by XBOOLE_1:1;
hence thesis by A15,A14,CKB1:def 1;
end;
