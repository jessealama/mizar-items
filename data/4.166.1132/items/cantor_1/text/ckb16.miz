theorem
Th12: (for X being set holds (for R being non empty (Subset-Family of ( bool X )) holds (for F being (Subset-Family of X) holds (F = { ( Intersect x ) where x is (Element of R): (not contradiction) } implies ( Intersect F ) = ( Intersect ( union R ) )))))
proof
let X being set;
let R being non empty (Subset-Family of ( bool X ));
let F being (Subset-Family of X);
assume that
A1: F = { ( Intersect x ) where x is (Element of R): (not contradiction) };
hereby
let c being set;
assume A2: c in ( Intersect F );
(for Y being set holds (Y in ( union R ) implies c in Y))
proof
let Y being set;
assume Y in ( union R );
then consider d being set such that A3: Y in d and A4: d in R by TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider d as (Subset-Family of X) by A4;
reconsider d as (Subset-Family of X);
( Intersect d ) in F by A1,A4;
then c in ( Intersect d ) by A2,SETFAM_1:43;
hence thesis by A3,SETFAM_1:43;
end;
hence c in ( Intersect ( union R ) ) by A2,SETFAM_1:43;
end;
let c being set;
assume A5: c in ( Intersect ( union R ) );
(for Y being set holds (Y in F implies c in Y))
proof
let Y being set;
assume Y in F;
then consider x being (Element of R) such that A6: Y = ( Intersect x ) by A1;
( Intersect ( union R ) ) c= ( Intersect x ) by SETFAM_1:44,ZFMISC_1:74;
hence thesis by A5,A6;
end;
hence thesis by A5,SETFAM_1:43;
end;
