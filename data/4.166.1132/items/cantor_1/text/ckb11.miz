theorem
Th5: (for T being non empty TopSpace holds (the topology of T) = ( FinMeetCl (the topology of T) ))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
set X = (the topology of T);
defpred P[ set ]
 means
( meet $1 ) in (the topology of T);
A1: (for B9 being (Element of ( Fin X )) holds (for b being (Element of X) holds (P[ B9 ] implies P[ ( B9 \/ { b } ) ])))
proof
let B9 being (Element of ( Fin X ));
let b being (Element of X);
A2: ( meet { b } ) = b by SETFAM_1:10;
assume A3: ( meet B9 ) in X;
per cases ;
suppose B9 <> ( {} );

then ( meet ( B9 \/ { b } ) ) = ( ( meet B9 ) /\ ( meet { b } ) ) by SETFAM_1:9;
hence thesis by A2,A3,PRE_TOPC:def 1;
end;
suppose B9 = ( {} );

hence thesis by A2;
end;
end;
thus (the topology of T) c= ( FinMeetCl (the topology of T) ) by CKB10:1;
A4: P[ ( {}. X ) ] by PRE_TOPC:1,SETFAM_1:1;
A5: (for B being (Element of ( Fin X )) holds P[ B ]) from SETWISEO:sch 4(A4,A1);
now
let x being (Subset of T);
assume x in ( FinMeetCl X );
then consider y being (Subset-Family of T) such that A6: (y c= X & y is  finite) and A7: x = ( Intersect y ) by CKB9:def 1;
reconsider y as (Subset-Family of T);
per cases ;
suppose A8: y <> ( {} );

A9: y in ( Fin X ) by A6,FINSUB_1:def 5;
x = ( meet y ) by A7,A8,SETFAM_1:def 9;
hence x in X by A5,A9;
end;
suppose A10: y = ( {} );

reconsider aa = ( {} ( bool (the carrier of T) ) ) as (Subset-Family of (the carrier of T));
( Intersect aa ) = (the carrier of T) by SETFAM_1:def 9;
hence x in X by A7,A10,PRE_TOPC:def 1;
end;
end;
hence thesis by SUBSET_1:2;
end;
