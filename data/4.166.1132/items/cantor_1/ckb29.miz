theorem
Th19: (for T1,T2 being  strict non empty TopSpace holds (for P being (prebasis of T1) holds (((the carrier of T1) = (the carrier of T2) & P is (prebasis of T2)) implies T1 = T2)))
proof
let T1 being  strict non empty TopSpace,T2 being  strict non empty TopSpace;
let P being (prebasis of T1);
assume that
A1: (the carrier of T1) = (the carrier of T2)
and
A2: P is (prebasis of T2);
reconsider P9 = P as (prebasis of T2) by A2;
consider B1 being (Basis of T1) such that A3: B1 c= ( FinMeetCl P ) by CKB23:def 1;
P c= (the topology of T1) by TOPS_2:64;
then ( FinMeetCl P ) c= ( FinMeetCl (the topology of T1) ) by CKB20:1;
then A4: ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl P ) ) c= ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl (the topology of T1) ) ) by CKB15:1;
P9 c= (the topology of T2) by TOPS_2:64;
then ( FinMeetCl P9 ) c= ( FinMeetCl (the topology of T2) ) by CKB20:1;
then A5: ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl P9 ) ) c= ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl (the topology of T2) ) ) by CKB15:1;
A6: (the topology of T1) c= ( UniCl B1 ) by CKB2:def 1;
( UniCl B1 ) c= ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl P ) ) by A3,CKB15:1;
then A7: (the topology of T1) c= ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl P ) ) by A6,XBOOLE_1:1;
consider B2 being (Basis of T2) such that A8: B2 c= ( FinMeetCl P9 ) by CKB23:def 1;
A9: (the topology of T2) c= ( UniCl B2 ) by CKB2:def 1;
( UniCl B2 ) c= ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl P9 ) ) by A8,CKB15:1;
then A10: (the topology of T2) c= ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl P9 ) ) by A9,XBOOLE_1:1;
(the topology of T2) = ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl (the topology of T2) ) ) by CKB13:1;
then A11: ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl P9 ) ) = (the topology of T2) by A10,A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
(the topology of T1) = ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl (the topology of T1) ) ) by CKB13:1;
hence thesis by A1,A7,A11,A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
