theorem
Th11: (((( ( a ^2 ) + ( b ^2 ) ) = ( c ^2 ) & a,b are_relative_prime ) & a is  odd) implies (ex m st (ex n st (((m <= n & a = ( ( n ^2 ) - ( m ^2 ) )) & b = ( ( 2 * m ) * n )) & c = ( ( n ^2 ) + ( m ^2 ) )))))
proof
assume A1: ( ( a ^2 ) + ( b ^2 ) ) = ( c ^2 );
assume A2: a,b are_relative_prime ;
assume a is  odd;
then reconsider a9 = a as  odd (Element of ( NAT ));
b is  even
proof
assume b is  odd;
then reconsider b9 = b as  odd (Element of ( NAT ));
( ( a9 ^2 ) + ( b9 ^2 ) ) = ( c ^2 ) by A1;
hence contradiction;
end;
then reconsider b9 = b as  even (Element of ( NAT ));
( ( a9 ^2 ) + ( b9 ^2 ) ) = ( c ^2 ) by A1;
then reconsider c9 = c as  odd (Element of ( NAT ));
2 divides ( c9 - a9 ) by ABIAN:def 1;
then consider i such that A3: ( c9 - a9 ) = ( 2 * i ) by INT_1:def 3;
( c ^2 ) >= ( ( a ^2 ) + ( 0 ) ) by A1,XREAL_1:6;
then c >= a by SQUARE_1:16;
then ( 2 * i ) >= ( 2 * ( 0 ) ) by A3,XREAL_1:48;
then i >= ( 0 ) by XREAL_1:68;
then reconsider m9 = i as (Element of ( NAT )) by INT_1:3;
consider n9 such that A4: ( c9 + a9 ) = ( 2 * n9 ) by ABIAN:def 2;
consider k9 such that A5: b9 = ( 2 * k9 ) by ABIAN:def 2;
A6: ( n9 * m9 ) = ( ( ( c + a ) / 2 ) * ( ( c - a ) / 2 ) ) by A4,A3
.= ( ( b / 2 ) ^2 ) by A1
.= ( k9 ^2 ) by A5;
A7: ( n9 + m9 ) = c by A4,A3;
A8: n9,m9 are_relative_prime 
proof
let p being  prime Nat;
assume that
A9: p divides n9
and
A10: p divides m9;
reconsider p as  prime (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
p divides c by A7,A9,A10,NAT_D:8;
then A11: p divides ( c * c ) by NAT_D:9;
p divides ( - m9 ) by A10,INT_2:10;
then A12: p divides ( n9 + ( - m9 ) ) by A9,WSIERP_1:4;
then p divides ( a * a ) by A4,A3,NAT_D:9;
then A13: p divides ( - ( a * a ) ) by INT_2:10;
( b * b ) = ( ( c * c ) + ( - ( a * a ) ) ) by A1;
then p divides (( b * b ) qua Integer) by A13,A11,WSIERP_1:4;
then p divides b by NEWTON:80;
hence contradiction by A2,A4,A3,A12,CKB2:def 1;
end;
then n9 is  square by A6,CKB11:1;
then consider n being Nat such that A14: n9 = ( n ^2 ) by CKB3:def 1;
m9 is  square by A8,A6,CKB11:1;
then consider m being Nat such that A15: m9 = ( m ^2 ) by CKB3:def 1;
reconsider m,n as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
take m;
take n;
( n9 - m9 ) = a by A4,A3;
then ( m ^2 ) <= ( n ^2 ) by A14,A15,XREAL_1:49;
hence m <= n by SQUARE_1:16;
thus a = ( ( n ^2 ) - ( m ^2 ) ) by A4,A3,A14,A15;
( b ^2 ) = ( ( 2 ^2 ) * ( ( n * m ) ^2 ) ) by A5,A6,A14,A15,SQUARE_1:9
.= ( ( ( 2 * m ) * n ) ^2 );
hence b = ( ( 2 * m ) * n ) by CKB19:1;
thus thesis by A4,A3,A14,A15;
