definition
redefine mode Pythagorean_triple
means :Def5: (ex k st (ex m st (ex n st (m <= n & it = { ( k * ( ( n ^2 ) - ( m ^2 ) ) ),( k * ( ( 2 * m ) * n ) ),( k * ( ( n ^2 ) + ( m ^2 ) ) ) }))));
compatibility
proof
let X being (Subset of ( NAT ));
hereby
assume X is Pythagorean_triple;
then consider a,b,c such that A1: ( ( a ^2 ) + ( b ^2 ) ) = ( c ^2 ) and A2: X = { a,b,c } by CKB27:def 1;
set k = ( a gcd b );
A3: k divides a by NAT_D:def 5;
A4: k divides b by NAT_D:def 5;
per cases ;
suppose k = ( 0 );

then A5: (a = ( 0 ) & b = ( 0 )) by A3,A4,INT_2:3;
thus (ex k st (ex m st (ex n st (m <= n & X = { ( k * ( ( n ^2 ) - ( m ^2 ) ) ),( k * ( ( 2 * m ) * n ) ),( k * ( ( n ^2 ) + ( m ^2 ) ) ) }))))
proof
take ( 0 );
take ( 0 );
take ( 0 );
thus thesis by A1,A2,A5,XCMPLX_1:6;
end;

end;
suppose A6: k <> ( 0 );

then A7: ( k * k ) <> ( 0 ) by XCMPLX_1:6;
consider a9 being Nat such that A8: a = ( k * a9 ) by A3,NAT_D:def 3;
consider b9 being Nat such that A9: b = ( k * b9 ) by A4,NAT_D:def 3;
reconsider a9,b9 as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
( k * ( a9 gcd b9 ) ) = ( k * 1 ) by A8,A9,CKB22:1;
then ( a9 gcd b9 ) = 1 by A6,XCMPLX_1:5;
then A10: a9,b9 are_relative_prime  by INT_2:def 3;
( c ^2 ) = ( ( k ^2 ) * ( ( a9 ^2 ) + ( b9 ^2 ) ) ) by A1,A8,A9;
then ( k ^2 ) divides ( c ^2 ) by NAT_D:def 3;
then k divides c by CKB20:1;
then consider c9 being Nat such that A11: c = ( k * c9 ) by NAT_D:def 3;
reconsider c9 as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
( ( k ^2 ) * ( ( a9 ^2 ) + ( b9 ^2 ) ) ) = ( ( k ^2 ) * ( c9 ^2 ) ) by A1,A8,A9,A11;
then A12: ( ( a9 ^2 ) + ( b9 ^2 ) ) = ( c9 ^2 ) by A7,XCMPLX_1:5;

proof
per cases  by A10,CKB24:1;
suppose a9 is  odd;

then consider m,n such that A13: (((m <= n & a9 = ( ( n ^2 ) - ( m ^2 ) )) & b9 = ( ( 2 * m ) * n )) & c9 = ( ( n ^2 ) + ( m ^2 ) )) by A12,A10,CKB25:1;
take k;
take m;
take n;
thus thesis by A2,A8,A9,A11,A13;
end;
suppose b9 is  odd;

then consider m,n such that A14: (((m <= n & b9 = ( ( n ^2 ) - ( m ^2 ) )) & a9 = ( ( 2 * m ) * n )) & c9 = ( ( n ^2 ) + ( m ^2 ) )) by A12,A10,CKB25:1;
take k;
take m;
take n;
thus thesis by A2,A8,A9,A11,A14,ENUMSET1:58;
end;
end;

end;

assume (ex k st (ex m st (ex n st (m <= n & X = { ( k * ( ( n ^2 ) - ( m ^2 ) ) ),( k * ( ( 2 * m ) * n ) ),( k * ( ( n ^2 ) + ( m ^2 ) ) ) }))));
then consider k,m,n such that A15: m <= n and A16: X = { ( k * ( ( n ^2 ) - ( m ^2 ) ) ),( k * ( ( 2 * m ) * n ) ),( k * ( ( n ^2 ) + ( m ^2 ) ) ) };
( m ^2 ) <= ( n ^2 ) by A15,SQUARE_1:15;
then reconsider a9 = ( ( n ^2 ) - ( m ^2 ) ) as (Element of ( NAT )) by INT_1:3,XREAL_1:48;
set a = ( k * a9 );
set c9 = ( ( n ^2 ) + ( m ^2 ) );

( ( a ^2 ) + ( b ^2 ) ) = ( c ^2 );
hence thesis by A16,CKB27:def 1;
