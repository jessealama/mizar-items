theorem
Th6: (m divides n iff ( m ^2 ) divides ( n ^2 ))
proof
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
(for n holds ($1 divides n iff ( $1 ^2 ) divides ( n ^2 )));
A1: (for m being Nat holds ((for k being Nat holds (k < m implies P[ k ])) implies P[ m ]))
proof
let m being Nat;
assume A2: (for k being Nat holds (k < m implies (for n holds (k divides n iff ( k ^2 ) divides ( n ^2 )))));
let n;
hereby
assume m divides n;
then consider k9 being Nat such that A3: n = ( m * k9 ) by NAT_D:def 3;
( n ^2 ) = ( ( m ^2 ) * ( k9 ^2 ) ) by A3;
hence ( m ^2 ) divides ( n ^2 ) by NAT_D:def 3;
end;
assume A4: ( m ^2 ) divides ( n ^2 );
per cases  by NAT_1:25;
suppose m = ( 0 );

then ( n ^2 ) = ( 0 ) by A4,INT_2:3;
then n = ( 0 ) by XCMPLX_1:6;
hence thesis by NAT_D:6;
end;
suppose m = 1;

hence thesis by NAT_D:6;
end;
suppose A5: m > 1;

consider k9 being Nat such that A6: ( n ^2 ) = ( ( m ^2 ) * k9 ) by A4,NAT_D:def 3;
m >= ( 1 + 1 ) by A5,NAT_1:13;
then consider p9 such that A7: p9 is  prime and A8: p9 divides m by INT_2:31;
reconsider p = p9 as  prime (Element of ( NAT )) by A7;
consider m9 being Nat such that A9: m = ( p * m9 ) by A8,NAT_D:def 3;
reconsider m9 as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
( m ^2 ) = ( ( m * m9 ) * p ) by A9;
then p divides ( m ^2 ) by NAT_D:def 3;
then p divides ( n ^2 ) by A4,NAT_D:4;
then p divides n by NEWTON:80;
then consider n9 being Nat such that A10: n = ( p * n9 ) by NAT_D:def 3;
A11: p > 1 by INT_2:def 4;
then A12: ( p ^2 ) > ( 0 ) by SQUARE_1:12;
reconsider n9 as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
( ( p ^2 ) * ( n9 ^2 ) ) = ( ( p ^2 ) * ( ( m9 ^2 ) * k9 ) ) by A9,A10,A6;
then ( n9 ^2 ) = ( ( m9 ^2 ) * k9 ) by A12,XCMPLX_1:5;
then A13: ( m9 ^2 ) divides ( n9 ^2 ) by NAT_D:def 3;
( p * m9 ) > ( 1 * m9 ) by A5,A9,A11,XREAL_1:98;
then m9 divides n9 by A2,A9,A13;
then consider k being Nat such that A14: n9 = ( m9 * k ) by NAT_D:def 3;
n = ( m * k ) by A9,A10,A14;
hence thesis by NAT_D:def 3;
end;
end;
(for m being Nat holds P[ m ]) from NAT_1:sch 4(A1);
hence thesis;
