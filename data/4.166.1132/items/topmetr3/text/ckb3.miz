theorem
Th4: (for X,Y being non empty MetrSpace holds (for f being (Function of ( TopSpaceMetr X ),( TopSpaceMetr Y )) holds (for S being (sequence of X) holds (for T being (sequence of Y) holds (((S is  convergent & T = ( f * S )) & f is  continuous) implies T is  convergent)))))
proof
let X being non empty MetrSpace,Y being non empty MetrSpace;
let f being (Function of ( TopSpaceMetr X ),( TopSpaceMetr Y ));
let S being (sequence of X);
let T being (sequence of Y);
assume that
A1: S is  convergent
and
A2: T = ( f * S )
and
A3: f is  continuous;
set z0 = ( lim S );
reconsider p = z0 as (Point of ( TopSpaceMetr X )) by TOPMETR:12;
A4: ( dom f ) = (the carrier of ( TopSpaceMetr X )) by FUNCT_2:def 1
.= (the carrier of X) by TOPMETR:12;
then ( f . ( lim S ) ) in ( rng f ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
then reconsider x0 = ( f . ( lim S ) ) as (Element of Y) by TOPMETR:12;
(for r being Real holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n <= m implies ( dist (( T . m ),x0) ) < r)))))
proof
let r being Real;
reconsider V = ( Ball (x0,r) ) as (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr Y )) by TOPMETR:12;
assume r > ( 0 );
then (V is  open & x0 in V) by GOBOARD6:1,TOPMETR:14;
then consider W being (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr X )) such that A5: (p in W & W is  open) and A6: ( f .: W ) c= V by A3,JGRAPH_2:10;
consider r0 being  real number such that A7: r0 > ( 0 ) and A8: ( Ball (z0,r0) ) c= W by A5,TOPMETR:15;
reconsider r00 = r0 as Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
consider n0 being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A9: (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n0 <= m implies ( dist (( S . m ),z0) ) < r00)) by A1,A7,TBSP_1:def 3;
(for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n0 <= m implies ( dist (( T . m ),x0) ) < r))
proof
let m being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume n0 <= m;
then ( dist (( S . m ),z0) ) < r0 by A9;
then ( S . m ) in ( Ball (z0,r0) ) by METRIC_1:11;
then A10: ( f . ( S . m ) ) in ( f .: W ) by A4,A8,FUNCT_1:def 6;
( dom T ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( T . m ) in ( f .: W ) by A2,A10,FUNCT_1:12;
hence thesis by A6,METRIC_1:11;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by TBSP_1:def 2;
