theorem
Th6: (for s being Real_Sequence holds (for S being (sequence of ( RealSpace )) holds (s = S implies ((s is  convergent iff S is  convergent) & (s is  convergent implies ( lim s ) = ( lim S ))))))
proof
let s being Real_Sequence;
let S being (sequence of ( RealSpace ));
assume A1: s = S;
A2: (s is  convergent implies S is  convergent)
proof
assume s is  convergent;
then consider g being  real number such that A3: (for p being  real number holds (( 0 ) < p implies (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n <= m implies ( abs ( ( s . m ) - g ) ) < p))))) by SEQ_2:def 6;
reconsider g0 = g as Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
reconsider x0 = g as (Point of ( RealSpace )) by METRIC_1:def 13,XREAL_0:def 1;
(for r being Real holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n <= m implies ( dist (( S . m ),x0) ) < r)))))
proof
let r being Real;
assume r > ( 0 );
then consider n0 being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A4: (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n0 <= m implies ( abs ( ( s . m ) - g ) ) < r)) by A3;
(for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n0 <= m implies ( dist (( S . m ),x0) ) < r))
proof
let m being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume A5: n0 <= m;
reconsider t = ( s . m ) as Real;
( dist (( S . m ),x0) ) = ( ( real_dist ) . (t,g) ) by A1,METRIC_1:def 1,METRIC_1:def 13
.= ( abs ( t - g0 ) ) by METRIC_1:def 12;
hence thesis by A4,A5;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by TBSP_1:def 2;
end;
(S is  convergent implies s is  convergent)
proof
assume S is  convergent;
then consider x being (Element of ( RealSpace )) such that A6: (for r being Real holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n <= m implies ( dist (( S . m ),x) ) < r))))) by TBSP_1:def 2;

(for p being  real number holds (( 0 ) < p implies (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n <= m implies ( abs ( ( s . m ) - g0 ) ) < p)))))
proof
let p being  real number;
reconsider p0 = p as Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
assume ( 0 ) < p;
then consider n0 being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A7: (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n0 <= m implies ( dist (( S . m ),x) ) < p0)) by A6;
(for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n0 <= m implies ( abs ( ( s . m ) - g0 ) ) < p))
proof
let m being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume A8: n0 <= m;
reconsider t = ( s . m ) as Real;
( dist (( S . m ),x) ) = ( ( real_dist ) . (t,g0) ) by A1,METRIC_1:def 1,METRIC_1:def 13
.= ( abs ( t - g0 ) ) by METRIC_1:def 12;
hence thesis by A7,A8;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by SEQ_2:def 6;
end;
hence (s is  convergent iff S is  convergent) by A2;
thus (s is  convergent implies ( lim s ) = ( lim S ))
proof
reconsider g0 = ( lim S ) as Real by METRIC_1:def 13;
assume A9: s is  convergent;
(for r being  real number holds (( 0 ) < r implies (ex m being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m <= n implies ( abs ( ( s . n ) - g0 ) ) < r)))))
proof
let r being  real number;
reconsider r0 = r as Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
assume ( 0 ) < r;
then consider m0 being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A10: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m0 <= n implies ( dist (( S . n ),( lim S )) ) < r0)) by A2,A9,TBSP_1:def 3;
(for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m0 <= n implies ( abs ( ( s . n ) - g0 ) ) < r))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume A11: m0 <= n;
( dist (( S . n ),( lim S )) ) = ( ( real_dist ) . (( s . n ),g0) ) by A1,METRIC_1:def 1,METRIC_1:def 13
.= ( abs ( ( s . n ) - g0 ) ) by METRIC_1:def 12;
hence thesis by A10,A11;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by A9,SEQ_2:def 7;
