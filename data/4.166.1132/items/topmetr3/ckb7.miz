theorem
Th9: (for a,b being  real number holds (for S1 being (sequence of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) holds (for S being (sequence of ( RealSpace )) holds ((S = S1 & a <= b) implies ((S is  convergent iff S1 is  convergent) & (S is  convergent implies ( lim S ) = ( lim S1 )))))))
proof
let a being  real number,b being  real number;
let S1 being (sequence of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) ));
let S being (sequence of ( RealSpace ));
assume that
A1: S = S1
and
A2: a <= b;
reconsider P = [. a,b .] as (Subset of ( R^1 )) by TOPMETR:17;
A3: (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) = [. a,b .] by A2,TOPMETR:10;
A4: (S is  convergent implies S1 is  convergent)
proof
A5: (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( S . m ) in [. a,b .])
proof
let m being (Element of ( NAT ));
( dom S1 ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( S1 . m ) in ( rng S1 ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A1,A3;
end;
A6: P is  closed by TREAL_1:1;
assume A7: S is  convergent;
then consider x0 being (Element of ( RealSpace )) such that A8: (for r being Real holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n <= m implies ( dist (( S . m ),x0) ) < r))))) by TBSP_1:def 2;
x0 = ( lim S ) by A7,A8,TBSP_1:def 3;
then reconsider x1 = x0 as (Element of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) by A3,A7,A5,A6,CKB1:1,TOPMETR:def 6;
(for r being Real holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n <= m implies ( dist (( S1 . m ),x1) ) < r)))))
proof
let r being Real;
assume r > ( 0 );
then consider n0 being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A9: (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n0 <= m implies ( dist (( S . m ),x0) ) < r)) by A8;
(for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n0 <= m implies ( dist (( S1 . m ),x1) ) < r))
proof
let m being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume A10: n0 <= m;
( dist (( S1 . m ),x1) ) = ( (the distance of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) . (( S1 . m ),x1) ) by METRIC_1:def 1
.= ( (the distance of ( RealSpace )) . (( S1 . m ),x1) ) by TOPMETR:def 1
.= ( dist (( S . m ),x0) ) by A1,METRIC_1:def 1;
hence thesis by A9,A10;

hence thesis;

hence thesis by TBSP_1:def 2;

(S1 is  convergent implies S is  convergent)
proof
assume S1 is  convergent;
then consider x0 being (Element of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) such that A11: (for r being Real holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n <= m implies ( dist (( S1 . m ),x0) ) < r))))) by TBSP_1:def 2;
x0 in [. a,b .] by A3;
then reconsider x1 = x0 as (Element of ( RealSpace )) by METRIC_1:def 13;
(for r being Real holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n <= m implies ( dist (( S . m ),x1) ) < r)))))
proof
let r being Real;
assume r > ( 0 );
then consider n0 being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A12: (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n0 <= m implies ( dist (( S1 . m ),x0) ) < r)) by A11;
(for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n0 <= m implies ( dist (( S . m ),x1) ) < r))
proof
let m being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume A13: n0 <= m;
( dist (( S1 . m ),x0) ) = ( (the distance of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) . (( S1 . m ),x0) ) by METRIC_1:def 1
.= ( (the distance of ( RealSpace )) . (( S1 . m ),x0) ) by TOPMETR:def 1
.= ( dist (( S . m ),x1) ) by A1,METRIC_1:def 1;
hence thesis by A12,A13;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by TBSP_1:def 2;
end;
hence (S is  convergent iff S1 is  convergent) by A4;
thus (S is  convergent implies ( lim S ) = ( lim S1 ))
proof
( lim S1 ) in (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) ));
then reconsider t0 = ( lim S1 ) as (Point of ( RealSpace )) by A3,METRIC_1:def 13;
assume A14: S is  convergent;
(for r1 being Real holds (( 0 ) < r1 implies (ex m1 being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for n1 being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m1 <= n1 implies ( dist (( S . n1 ),t0) ) < r1)))))
proof
let r1 being Real;
assume ( 0 ) < r1;
then consider m1 being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A15: (for n1 being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m1 <= n1 implies ( dist (( S1 . n1 ),( lim S1 )) ) < r1)) by A4,A14,TBSP_1:def 3;
(for n1 being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m1 <= n1 implies ( dist (( S . n1 ),t0) ) < r1))
proof
let n1 being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume A16: m1 <= n1;
( dist (( S1 . n1 ),( lim S1 )) ) = ( (the distance of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) . (( S1 . n1 ),( lim S1 )) ) by METRIC_1:def 1
.= ( (the distance of ( RealSpace )) . (( S1 . n1 ),( lim S1 )) ) by TOPMETR:def 1
.= ( dist (( S . n1 ),t0) ) by A1,METRIC_1:def 1;
hence thesis by A15,A16;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by A14,TBSP_1:def 3;
