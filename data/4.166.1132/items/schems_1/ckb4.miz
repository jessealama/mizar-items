reserve a for set;
scheme Schemat9 { P[set],Q[set] } : ((for a holds P[ a ]) iff (for a holds Q[ a ]))
provided
A1: (for a holds (P[ a ] iff Q[ a ]))
proof
thus ((for a holds P[ a ]) implies (for a holds Q[ a ]))
proof
assume A2: (for a holds P[ a ]);
now
let a;
(P[ a ] iff Q[ a ]) by A1;
hence Q[ a ] by A2;
end;
hence thesis;
end;

assume A3: (for a holds Q[ a ]);
now
let a;
(P[ a ] iff Q[ a ]) by A1;
hence P[ a ] by A3;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
