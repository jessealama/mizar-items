provided
A1: (for b holds (ex a st (P[ a ] & Q[ b ])))
proof
assume A2: ((for a holds (not P[ a ])) or (ex b st (not Q[ b ])));
per cases  by A2;
suppose (ex b st (not Q[ b ]));

then consider b such that A3: (not Q[ b ]);
now
let d;
assume d = b;
(ex a st (P[ a ] & Q[ b ])) by A1;
hence contradiction by A3;

hence thesis;

suppose A4: (for a holds (not P[ a ]));

now
let b;
(ex a st (P[ a ] & Q[ b ])) by A1;
hence thesis by A4;

hence thesis;
