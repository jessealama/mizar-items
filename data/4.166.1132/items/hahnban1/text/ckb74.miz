Th30: (for V being non  empty (VectSp of ( F_Complex )) holds (for M being (Subspace of V) holds ( RealVS M ) is (Subspace of ( RealVS V ))))

A4: ( the addLoopStr of V ) = ( the addLoopStr of ( RealVS V ) ) by CKB67:def 1;
hence A5: (the carrier of ( RealVS M )) c= (the carrier of ( RealVS V )) by A3,VECTSP_4:def 2;
then [: ( REAL ),(the carrier of ( RealVS M )) :] c= [: ( REAL ),(the carrier of ( RealVS V )) :] by ZFMISC_1:95;

proof
let y being set;
