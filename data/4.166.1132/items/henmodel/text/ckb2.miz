theorem
Th2: (( union A ) in A & (for a holds (a in A implies (a in ( union A ) or a = ( union A )))))
proof
consider a being Ordinal such that A1: ( RelIncl A ),( RelIncl a ) are_isomorphic  by WELLORD2:8,WELLORD2:13;
consider F1 being Function such that A2: F1 is_isomorphism_of ( RelIncl A ),( RelIncl a ) by A1,WELLORD1:def 8;
( dom F1 ) = ( field ( RelIncl A ) ) by A2,WELLORD1:def 7;
then A3: ( dom F1 ) = A by WELLORD2:def 1;
then consider b such that A4: b in ( dom F1 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
( rng F1 ) is  finite by A3,FINSET_1:8;
then ( field ( RelIncl a ) ) is  finite by A2,WELLORD1:def 7;
then A5: a is  finite by WELLORD2:def 1;
A6:now
assume (not a in ( omega ));
hence contradiction by A5,FINSET_1:1,ORDINAL1:16;
end;
( F1 . b ) in ( rng F1 ) by A4,FUNCT_1:3;
then ( field ( RelIncl a ) ) is non  empty by A2,WELLORD1:def 7;
then a is non  empty by WELLORD2:def 1;
then A8: ( {} ) in a by ORDINAL1:16,XBOOLE_1:3;
A9:now
assume a is  limit_ordinal;
then ( omega ) c= a by A8,ORDINAL1:def 11;
hence contradiction by A5;
end;
( RelIncl a ),( RelIncl A ) are_isomorphic  by A1,WELLORD1:40;
then consider F being Function such that A11: F is_isomorphism_of ( RelIncl a ),( RelIncl A ) by WELLORD1:def 8;
A12: (for m holds (for n holds (((m in ( dom F ) & n in ( dom F )) & n < m) implies ( F . n ) in ( F . m ))))
proof
let m;
let n;
assume that
A13: m in ( dom F )
and
A14: n in ( dom F )
and
A15: n < m;
( F . n ) in ( rng F ) by A14,FUNCT_1:3;
then ( F . n ) in ( field ( RelIncl A ) ) by A11,WELLORD1:def 7;
then A16: ( F . n ) in A by WELLORD2:def 1;
then reconsider b = ( F . n ) as (Element of ( NAT ));
n in ( field ( RelIncl a ) ) by A11,A14,WELLORD1:def 7;
then A17: n in a by WELLORD2:def 1;
( F . m ) in ( rng F ) by A13,FUNCT_1:3;
then ( F . m ) in ( field ( RelIncl A ) ) by A11,WELLORD1:def 7;
then A18: ( F . m ) in A by WELLORD2:def 1;
then reconsider c = ( F . m ) as (Element of ( NAT ));

then n in m by AXIOMS:4;
then A19: n c= m by ORDINAL1:def 2;
m in ( field ( RelIncl a ) ) by A11,A13,WELLORD1:def 7;
then m in a by WELLORD2:def 1;
then [ n,m ] in ( RelIncl a ) by A17,A19,WELLORD2:def 1;
then [ ( F . n ),( F . m ) ] in ( RelIncl A ) by A11,WELLORD1:def 7;
then A20: ( F . n ) c= ( F . m ) by A16,A18,WELLORD2:def 1;
F is  one-to-one by A11,WELLORD1:def 7;
then ( F . n ) <> ( F . m ) by A13,A14,A15,FUNCT_1:def 4;
then ( F . n ) c< ( F . m ) by A20,XBOOLE_0:def 8;
then b in c by ORDINAL1:11;
hence thesis;
end;
reconsider a as (Element of ( NAT )) by A6;
( dom F ) = ( field ( RelIncl a ) ) by A11,WELLORD1:def 7;
then A21: ( dom F ) = a by WELLORD2:def 1;
A22:now
let b being Ordinal;
assume ( succ b ) = a;
then b in a by ORDINAL1:6;
hence b is (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:10;
end;
A23: (ex m st ( succ m ) = a)
proof
consider b being Ordinal such that A24: ( succ b ) = a by A9,ORDINAL1:29;
reconsider b as (Element of ( NAT )) by A22,A24;
take b;
thus thesis by A24;
end;
then consider m such that A25: ( succ m ) = a;
A26: ( rng F ) = ( field ( RelIncl A ) ) by A11,WELLORD1:def 7;
then A27: ( rng F ) = A by WELLORD2:def 1;
then reconsider F as (Function of a,A) by A21,FUNCT_2:1;
A28: (for n holds (for m holds (((m in ( dom F ) & n in ( dom F )) & n < m) implies ( F . n ) in ( F . m )))) by A12;
( rng F ) = A by A26,WELLORD2:def 1;
then A29: ( F . ( union a ) ) = ( union ( rng F ) ) by A23,A28,CKB1:1;
A30: ( union a ) = m by A25,ORDINAL2:2;
hence ( union A ) in A by A27,A21,A25,A29,FUNCT_1:3,ORDINAL1:6;
thus (for b holds (b in A implies (b in ( union A ) or b = ( union A ))))
proof
let b;
assume that
A31: b in A;
now
A32: m in ( dom F ) by A21,A25,ORDINAL1:6;
assume A33: b <> ( union A );
consider c such that A34: c in ( dom F ) and A35: ( F . c ) = b by A27,A31,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider c as (Element of ( NAT )) by A34,ORDINAL1:10;
(c in m or c = m) by A25,A34,ORDINAL1:8;
then c in { k: k < m } by A27,A25,A29,A33,A35,AXIOMS:4,ORDINAL2:2;
then (ex k st (k = c & k < m));
hence thesis by A12,A27,A29,A30,A34,A35,A32;

hence thesis;
