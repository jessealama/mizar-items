theorem
(for A being (Subset of FT) holds (FT is  symmetric implies (A is  connected iff A is  arcwise_connected)))
proof
let A being (Subset of FT);
assume A1: FT is  symmetric;
now
assume (not A is  arcwise_connected);
then consider x1 being (Element of FT),x2 being (Element of FT) such that A2: x1 in A and A3: x2 in A and A4: (not (ex f being (FinSequence of FT) st (((f is  continuous & ( rng f ) c= A) & ( f . 1 ) = x1) & ( f . ( len f ) ) = x2))) by CKB61:def 1;
A5: { z where z is (Element of FT): (z in A & (ex f being (FinSequence of FT) st (((f is  continuous & ( rng f ) c= A) & ( f . 1 ) = x1) & ( f . ( len f ) ) = z))) } c= A
proof
let x being set;
assume x in { z where z is (Element of FT): (z in A & (ex f being (FinSequence of FT) st (((f is  continuous & ( rng f ) c= A) & ( f . 1 ) = x1) & ( f . ( len f ) ) = z))) };
then (ex z being (Element of FT) st ((x = z & z in A) & (ex f being (FinSequence of FT) st (((f is  continuous & ( rng f ) c= A) & ( f . 1 ) = x1) & ( f . ( len f ) ) = z))));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider G = { z where z is (Element of FT): (z in A & (ex f being (FinSequence of FT) st (((f is  continuous & ( rng f ) c= A) & ( f . 1 ) = x1) & ( f . ( len f ) ) = z))) } as (Subset of FT) by XBOOLE_1:1;
A6: G misses ( A \ G ) by XBOOLE_1:79;
A7:now
assume ( G ^b ) meets ( A \ G );
then consider u being set such that A8: u in ( G ^b ) and A9: u in ( A \ G ) by XBOOLE_0:3;
A10: (not u in G) by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
consider x being (Element of FT) such that A11: u = x and A12: ( U_FT x ) meets G by A8;
consider y being set such that A13: y in ( U_FT x ) and A14: y in G by A12,XBOOLE_0:3;
consider z2 being (Element of FT) such that A15: y = z2 and z2 in A and A16: (ex f being (FinSequence of FT) st (((f is  continuous & ( rng f ) c= A) & ( f . 1 ) = x1) & ( f . ( len f ) ) = z2)) by A14;
consider f being (FinSequence of FT) such that A17: f is  continuous and A18: ( rng f ) c= A and A19: ( f . 1 ) = x1 and A20: ( f . ( len f ) ) = z2 by A16;
reconsider g = ( f ^ <* x *> ) as (FinSequence of FT);

.= ( ( rng f ) \/ { x } ) by FINSEQ_1:38;
A22: u in A by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then { x } c= A by A11,ZFMISC_1:31;
then A23: ( rng g ) c= A by A18,A21,XBOOLE_1:8;
1 <= ( len f ) by A17,CKB56:def 1;
then 1 in ( dom f ) by FINSEQ_3:25;
then A24: (( g . ( ( len f ) + 1 ) ) = x & ( g . 1 ) = x1) by A19,FINSEQ_1:42,FINSEQ_1:def 7;
x in ( U_FT z2 ) by A1,A13,A15,FIN_TOPO:def 13;
then A25: g is  continuous by A17,A20,CKB59:1;
( len g ) = ( ( len f ) + ( len <* x *> ) ) by FINSEQ_1:22
.= ( ( len f ) + 1 ) by FINSEQ_1:39;
hence contradiction by A22,A10,A11,A25,A24,A23;
end;
A26:now
{ x1 } c= A by A2,ZFMISC_1:31;
then A27: ( rng <* x1 *> ) c= A by FINSEQ_1:38;
assume A28: G = ( {} );
A29: ( <* x1 *> . 1 ) = x1 by FINSEQ_1:40;
then ( <* x1 *> . ( len <* x1 *> ) ) = x1 by FINSEQ_1:39;
then x1 in G by A2,A27,A29;
hence contradiction by A28;
end;
A30:now
assume ( A \ G ) = ( {} );
then A c= G by XBOOLE_1:37;
then G = A by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then (ex z being (Element of FT) st ((z = x2 & z in A) & (ex f being (FinSequence of FT) st (((f is  continuous & ( rng f ) c= A) & ( f . 1 ) = x1) & ( f . ( len f ) ) = z)))) by A3;
hence contradiction by A4;
end;
A = ( G \/ ( A \ G ) ) by A5,XBOOLE_1:45;
hence (not A is  connected) by A30,A26,A6,A7,FIN_TOPO:def 16;
end;
hence (A is  connected implies A is  arcwise_connected);
now
assume (not A is  connected);
then consider P being (Subset of FT),Q being (Subset of FT) such that A31: A = ( P \/ Q ) and A32: P <> ( {} ) and A33: Q <> ( {} ) and A34: P misses Q and A35: ( P ^b ) misses Q by FIN_TOPO:def 16;

then reconsider p1 = p0 as (Element of FT);
A36: (p1 in A & q1 in A) by A31,A32,A33,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
thus now
assume A is  arcwise_connected;
then consider f being (FinSequence of FT) such that A37: f is  continuous and A38: ( rng f ) c= A and A39: ( f . 1 ) = p1 and A40: ( f . ( len f ) ) = q1 by A36,CKB61:def 1;
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
((1 <= $1 & $1 <= ( len f )) & ( f . $1 ) in P);
( len f ) >= 1 by A37,CKB56:def 1;
then A41: (ex k being Nat st P[ k ]) by A32,A39;
A42: (for k being Nat holds (P[ k ] implies k <= ( len f )));
consider i0 being Nat such that A43: (P[ i0 ] & (for n being Nat holds (P[ n ] implies n <= i0))) from NAT_1:sch 6(A42,A41);
i0 <> ( len f ) by A33,A34,A40,A43,XBOOLE_0:3;
then A44: i0 < ( len f ) by A43,XXREAL_0:1;
then A45: ( i0 + 1 ) <= ( len f ) by NAT_1:13;
reconsider u0 = ( f . i0 ) as (Element of FT) by A43;
A46: 1 < ( i0 + 1 ) by A43,NAT_1:13;
then ( i0 + 1 ) in ( dom f ) by A45,FINSEQ_3:25;
then A47: ( f . ( i0 + 1 ) ) in ( rng f ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
then reconsider z0 = ( f . ( i0 + 1 ) ) as (Element of FT);

then ( f . i0 ) in ( U_FT z0 ) by A1,FIN_TOPO:def 13;
then ( U_FT z0 ) meets P by A43,XBOOLE_0:3;
then A48: z0 in ( P ^b );
now
assume ( f . ( i0 + 1 ) ) in P;
then ( i0 + 1 ) <= i0 by A43,A45,A46;
hence contradiction by NAT_1:13;
end;
then ( f . ( i0 + 1 ) ) in Q by A31,A38,A47,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence contradiction by A35,A48,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
hence (not A is  arcwise_connected);

hence thesis;
