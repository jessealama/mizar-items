begin
reserve X for TopStruct;
reserve A for (Subset of X);
theorem
Th2: ((A = ( [#] X ) iff ( A ` ) = ( {} X )) & (A = (the carrier of X) iff ( A ` ) = ( {} )))
proof
thus (A = ( [#] X ) iff ( A ` ) = ( {} X ))
proof
thus (A = ( [#] X ) implies ( A ` ) = ( {} X )) by XBOOLE_1:37;
assume ( A ` ) = ( {} X );
then ( ( A ` ) ` ) = ( [#] X );
hence thesis;
