theorem
Th72: (((the carrier of X1) = (the carrier of X2) & (for C1 being (Subset of X1) holds (for C2 being (Subset of X2) holds (C1 = C2 implies (C1 is  open iff C2 is  open))))) implies ( the TopStruct of X1 ) = ( the TopStruct of X2 ))
proof
assume A1: (the carrier of X1) = (the carrier of X2);
assume A2: (for C1 being (Subset of X1) holds (for C2 being (Subset of X2) holds (C1 = C2 implies (C1 is  open iff C2 is  open))));
now
let D being set;
assume A3: D in (the topology of X2);
then reconsider C2 = D as (Subset of X2);
reconsider C1 = C2 as (Subset of X1) by A1;
C2 is  open by A3,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then C1 is  open by A2;
hence D in (the topology of X1) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
end;
then A4: (the topology of X2) c= (the topology of X1) by TARSKI:def 3;
now
let D being set;
assume A5: D in (the topology of X1);
then reconsider C1 = D as (Subset of X1);
reconsider C2 = C1 as (Subset of X2) by A1;
C1 is  open by A5,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then C2 is  open by A2;
hence D in (the topology of X2) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
end;
then (the topology of X1) c= (the topology of X2) by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis by A1,A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
