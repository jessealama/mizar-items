theorem
Th62: (for C,A being (Subset of X) holds (for B being (Subset of X0) holds ((((C is  open & C c= (the carrier of X0)) & A c= C) & A = B) implies ((C is  dense & B is  everywhere_dense) iff A is  everywhere_dense))))
proof
let C being (Subset of X);
let A being (Subset of X);
let B being (Subset of X0);
assume A1: C is  open;
assume C c= (the carrier of X0);
then reconsider E = C as (Subset of X0);
A2: E is  open by A1,TOPS_2:25;
assume A3: A c= C;
assume A4: A = B;
A5: ( Int B ) c= B by TOPS_1:16;
then reconsider D = ( Int B ) as (Subset of X) by A4,XBOOLE_1:1;
( Int B ) c= ( Int E ) by A3,A4,TOPS_1:19;
then A6: ( Int B ) c= E by A2,TOPS_1:23;
then A7: D is  open by A1,TSEP_1:9;
thus ((C is  dense & B is  everywhere_dense) implies A is  everywhere_dense)
proof
assume A8: C is  dense;
assume B is  everywhere_dense;
then ( Int B ) is  dense by CKB40:1;
then D is  dense by A6,A8,CKB65:1;
then ( Int A ) is  dense by A4,A5,A7,TOPS_1:24,TOPS_1:44;
hence thesis by CKB40:1;
end;

thus (A is  everywhere_dense implies (C is  dense & B is  everywhere_dense))
proof
assume A9: A is  everywhere_dense;
hence C is  dense by A3,CKB38:1,CKB43:1;
thus thesis by A4,A9,CKB66:1;
end;

end;
