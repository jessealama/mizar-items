begin
reserve X for TopSpace;
reserve A for (Subset of X);
theorem
(A is  boundary iff (for C being (Subset of X) holds ((( A ` ) c= C & C is  closed) implies C = (the carrier of X))))
proof
thus (A is  boundary implies (for C being (Subset of X) holds ((( A ` ) c= C & C is  closed) implies C = (the carrier of X))))
proof
assume A1: A is  boundary;
let C being (Subset of X);
assume ( A ` ) c= C;
then A2: ( C ` ) c= ( ( A ` ) ` ) by SUBSET_1:12;
assume C is  closed;
then ( C ` ) = ( {} X ) by A1,A2,TOPS_1:50;
hence thesis by CKB2:1;
end;

assume A3: (for C being (Subset of X) holds ((( A ` ) c= C & C is  closed) implies C = (the carrier of X)));
now
let G being (Subset of X);
assume that
A4: G c= A
and
A5: G is  open;
( A ` ) c= ( G ` ) by A4,SUBSET_1:12;
then ( G ` ) = (the carrier of X) by A3,A5;
hence G = ( {} ) by CKB1:1;
end;
hence thesis by TOPS_1:50;
end;
