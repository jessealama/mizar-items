begin
reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
reserve A for (Subset of X);
theorem
(A is  dense iff (for C being (Subset of X) holds ((A c= C & C is  closed) implies C = (the carrier of X))))
proof
thus (A is  dense implies (for C being (Subset of X) holds ((A c= C & C is  closed) implies C = (the carrier of X))))
proof
assume A1: ( Cl A ) = (the carrier of X);
let C being (Subset of X);
assume (A c= C & C is  closed);
then ( Cl A ) c= C by TOPS_1:5;
hence thesis by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;

assume (for C being (Subset of X) holds ((A c= C & C is  closed) implies C = (the carrier of X)));
then ( Cl A ) = (the carrier of X) by PRE_TOPC:18;
hence thesis by CKB17:def 1;
end;
