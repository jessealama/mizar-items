begin
reserve X for TopSpace;
reserve A for (Subset of X);
reserve B for (Subset of X);
theorem
Th5: (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A is  closed implies ( Int ( A \/ B ) ) c= ( A \/ ( Int B ) )))
proof
let A being (Subset of X);
assume A is  closed;
then ( Cl A ) = A by PRE_TOPC:22;
hence thesis by CKB4:1;
end;
