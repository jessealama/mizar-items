begin
reserve X for TopStruct;
reserve A for (Subset of X);
theorem
Th1: ((A = ( {} X ) iff ( A ` ) = ( [#] X )) & (A = ( {} ) iff ( A ` ) = (the carrier of X)))
proof
thus (A = ( {} X ) iff ( A ` ) = ( [#] X ))
proof
thus (A = ( {} X ) implies ( A ` ) = ( [#] X ));
assume ( A ` ) = ( [#] X );
then ( ( A ` ) ` ) = ( {} X ) by XBOOLE_1:37;
hence thesis;
