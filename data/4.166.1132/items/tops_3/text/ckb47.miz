begin
reserve X for non empty TopSpace;
reserve A for (Subset of X);
theorem
(A is  everywhere_dense iff (for F being (Subset of X) holds ((F <> (the carrier of X) & F is  closed) implies (ex H being (Subset of X) st (((F c= H & H <> (the carrier of X)) & H is  closed) & ( A \/ H ) = (the carrier of X))))))
proof
thus (A is  everywhere_dense implies (for F being (Subset of X) holds ((F <> (the carrier of X) & F is  closed) implies (ex H being (Subset of X) st (((F c= H & H <> (the carrier of X)) & H is  closed) & ( A \/ H ) = (the carrier of X))))))
proof
assume A is  everywhere_dense;
then A1: ( A ` ) is  nowhere_dense by CKB44:1;
let F being (Subset of X);
assume F <> (the carrier of X);
then A2: ( ( [#] X ) \ F ) <> ( {} ) by PRE_TOPC:4;
assume F is  closed;
then consider G being (Subset of X) such that A3: G c= ( F ` ) and A4: G <> ( {} ) and A5: G is  open and A6: ( A ` ) misses G by A1,A2,CKB31:1;
take H = ( G ` );
( ( F ` ) ` ) c= H by A3,SUBSET_1:12;
hence F c= H;
( H ` ) <> ( {} ) by A4;
then ( ( [#] X ) \ H ) <> ( {} );
hence H <> (the carrier of X) by PRE_TOPC:4;
thus H is  closed by A5;
( ( A ` ) /\ ( H ` ) ) = ( {} ) by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then ( ( A \/ H ) ` ) = ( {} X ) by XBOOLE_1:53;
hence thesis by CKB2:1;

(for G being (Subset of X) holds ((G <> ( {} ) & G is  open) implies (ex H being (Subset of X) st (((H c= G & H <> ( {} )) & H is  open) & ( A ` ) misses H))))
proof
let G being (Subset of X);
assume G <> ( {} );
then ( ( G ` ) ` ) <> ( {} );
then A8: ( G ` ) <> ( [#] X ) by PRE_TOPC:4;
assume G is  open;
then consider F being (Subset of X) such that A9: ( G ` ) c= F and A10: F <> (the carrier of X) and A11: F is  closed and A12: ( A \/ F ) = (the carrier of X) by A7,A8;
take H = ( F ` );
H c= ( ( G ` ) ` ) by A9,SUBSET_1:12;
hence H c= G;
F <> ( [#] X ) by A10;
hence H <> ( {} ) by PRE_TOPC:4;
thus H is  open by A11;
( ( A \/ F ) ` ) = ( {} X ) by A12,CKB2:1;
hence ( ( A ` ) /\ H ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_1:53;
end;
then ( A ` ) is  nowhere_dense by CKB31:1;
