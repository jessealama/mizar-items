begin
reserve X for TopSpace;
reserve A for (Subset of X);
theorem
(( A \/ ( Cl ( Int A ) ) ) = (the carrier of X) implies ( Cl ( Int A ) ) = (the carrier of X))
proof
assume ( A \/ ( Cl ( Int A ) ) ) = (the carrier of X);
then ( ( Int A ) \/ ( Cl ( Int A ) ) ) = (the carrier of X) by TDLAT_3:4;
hence thesis by PRE_TOPC:18,XBOOLE_1:12;
