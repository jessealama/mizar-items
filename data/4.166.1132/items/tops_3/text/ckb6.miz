begin
reserve X for TopSpace;
reserve B for (Subset of X);
theorem
Th6: (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A is  closed implies ( Int ( A \/ B ) ) = ( Int ( A \/ ( Int B ) ) )))
proof
let A being (Subset of X);
( A \/ ( Int B ) ) c= ( A \/ B ) by TOPS_1:16,XBOOLE_1:9;
then A1: ( Int ( A \/ ( Int B ) ) ) c= ( Int ( A \/ B ) ) by TOPS_1:19;
assume A is  closed;
then ( Int ( Int ( A \/ B ) ) ) c= ( Int ( A \/ ( Int B ) ) ) by CKB5:1,TOPS_1:19;
hence thesis by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
