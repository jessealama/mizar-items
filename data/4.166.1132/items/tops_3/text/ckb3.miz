theorem
Th3: (for X being TopSpace holds (for A,B being (Subset of X) holds ( ( Int A ) /\ ( Cl B ) ) c= ( Cl ( A /\ B ) )))
proof
let X being TopSpace;
let A being (Subset of X),B being (Subset of X);
( ( Int A ) /\ B ) c= ( A /\ B ) by TOPS_1:16,XBOOLE_1:26;
then A1: ( Cl ( ( Int A ) /\ B ) ) c= ( Cl ( A /\ B ) ) by PRE_TOPC:19;
( ( Int A ) /\ ( Cl B ) ) c= ( Cl ( ( Int A ) /\ B ) ) by TOPS_1:13;
hence thesis by A1,XBOOLE_1:1;
