theorem
Th15: (for S,T being non  empty Poset holds (for g being (Function of S,T) holds ((S is  complete & g is  infs-preserving) implies (ex d being (Function of T,S) st ([ g,d ] is  Galois & (for t being (Element of T) holds ( d . t ) is_minimum_of ( g " ( uparrow t ) )))))))
proof
let S being non  empty Poset;
let T being non  empty Poset;
let g being (Function of S,T);
assume that
A1: S is  complete
and
A2: g is  infs-preserving;
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(ex t being (Element of T) st (t = $1 & $2 = ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) )));
A3: (for e being set holds (e in (the carrier of T) implies (ex u being set st (u in (the carrier of S) & P[ e,u ]))))
proof
let e being set;
assume e in (the carrier of T);
then reconsider t = e as (Element of T);
take ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) );
thus thesis;
end;
consider d being (Function of (the carrier of T),(the carrier of S)) such that A4: (for e being set holds (e in (the carrier of T) implies P[ e,( d . e ) ])) from FUNCT_2:sch 1(A3);
A5: (for t being (Element of T) holds ( d . t ) = ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) ))
proof
let t being (Element of T);
(ex t1 being (Element of T) st (t1 = t & ( d . t ) = ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t1 ) ) ))) by A4;
hence thesis;
end;
reconsider d as (Function of T,S);
(for X being (Filter of S) holds g preserves_inf_of X) by A2,WAYBEL_0:def 32;
then A6: g is  monotone by WAYBEL_0:69;
A7: (for t being (Element of T) holds (for s being (Element of S) holds (t <= ( g . s ) iff ( d . t ) <= s)))
proof
let t being (Element of T);
let s being (Element of S);
A8:  ex_inf_of ( uparrow t ),T by WAYBEL_0:39;
A9:  ex_inf_of ( g " ( uparrow t ) ),S by A1,YELLOW_0:17;
then ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) ) is_<=_than ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) by YELLOW_0:31;
then A10: ( d . t ) is_<=_than ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) by A5;
hereby
assume t <= ( g . s );
then ( g . s ) in ( uparrow t ) by WAYBEL_0:18;
then s in ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) by FUNCT_2:38;
hence ( d . t ) <= s by A10,LATTICE3:def 8;
end;
g preserves_inf_of ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) by A2,WAYBEL_0:def 32;
then ( ex_inf_of ( g .: ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) ),T & ( g . ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) ) ) = ( inf ( g .: ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) ) )) by A9,WAYBEL_0:def 30;
then ( g . ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) ) ) >= ( inf ( uparrow t ) ) by A8,FUNCT_1:75,YELLOW_0:35;
then A11: ( g . ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) ) ) >= t by WAYBEL_0:39;
assume ( d . t ) <= s;
then ( g . ( d . t ) ) <= ( g . s ) by A6,CKB2:def 1;
then ( g . ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) ) ) <= ( g . s ) by A5;
hence thesis by A11,ORDERS_2:3;
end;
take d;
d is  monotone
proof
let t1 being (Element of T);
let t2 being (Element of T);
assume t1 <= t2;
then A12: ( uparrow t2 ) c= ( uparrow t1 ) by WAYBEL_0:22;
( ex_inf_of ( g " ( uparrow t1 ) ),S &  ex_inf_of ( g " ( uparrow t2 ) ),S) by A1,YELLOW_0:17;
then ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t1 ) ) ) <= ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t2 ) ) ) by A12,RELAT_1:143,YELLOW_0:35;
then ( d . t1 ) <= ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t2 ) ) ) by A5;
hence ( d . t1 ) <= ( d . t2 ) by A5;
end;
hence [ g,d ] is  Galois by A6,A7,CKB23:1;
let t being (Element of T);
thus A13:  ex_inf_of ( g " ( uparrow t ) ),S by A1,YELLOW_0:17;
thus A14: ( d . t ) = ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) ) by A5;
A15:  ex_inf_of ( uparrow t ),T by WAYBEL_0:39;
g preserves_inf_of ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) by A2,WAYBEL_0:def 32;
then ( ex_inf_of ( g .: ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) ),T & ( g . ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) ) ) = ( inf ( g .: ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) ) )) by A13,WAYBEL_0:def 30;
then ( g . ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) ) ) >= ( inf ( uparrow t ) ) by A15,FUNCT_1:75,YELLOW_0:35;
then ( g . ( inf ( g " ( uparrow t ) ) ) ) >= t by WAYBEL_0:39;
then ( g . ( d . t ) ) >= t by A5;
then ( g . ( d . t ) ) in ( uparrow t ) by WAYBEL_0:18;
hence thesis by A14,FUNCT_2:38;
