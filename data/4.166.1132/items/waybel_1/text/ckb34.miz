theorem
Th16: (for S,T being non  empty Poset holds (for d being (Function of T,S) holds ((T is  complete & d is  sups-preserving) implies (ex g being (Function of S,T) st ([ g,d ] is  Galois & (for s being (Element of S) holds ( g . s ) is_maximum_of ( d " ( downarrow s ) )))))))
proof
let S being non  empty Poset;
let T being non  empty Poset;
let d being (Function of T,S);
assume that
A1: T is  complete
and
A2: d is  sups-preserving;
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(ex s being (Element of S) st (s = $1 & $2 = ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) )));
A3: (for e being set holds (e in (the carrier of S) implies (ex u being set st (u in (the carrier of T) & P[ e,u ]))))
proof
let e being set;
assume e in (the carrier of S);
then reconsider s = e as (Element of S);
take ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) );
thus thesis;
end;
consider g being (Function of (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T)) such that A4: (for e being set holds (e in (the carrier of S) implies P[ e,( g . e ) ])) from FUNCT_2:sch 1(A3);
A5: (for s being (Element of S) holds ( g . s ) = ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) ))
proof
let s being (Element of S);
(ex s1 being (Element of S) st (s1 = s & ( g . s ) = ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s1 ) ) ))) by A4;
hence thesis;
end;
reconsider g as (Function of S,T);
(for X being (Ideal of T) holds d preserves_sup_of X) by A2,WAYBEL_0:def 33;
then A6: d is  monotone by WAYBEL_0:72;
A7: (for t being (Element of T) holds (for s being (Element of S) holds (s >= ( d . t ) iff ( g . s ) >= t)))
proof
let t being (Element of T);
let s being (Element of S);
A8:  ex_sup_of ( downarrow s ),S by WAYBEL_0:34;
A9:  ex_sup_of ( d " ( downarrow s ) ),T by A1,YELLOW_0:17;
then ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) ) is_>=_than ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) by YELLOW_0:30;
then A10: ( g . s ) is_>=_than ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) by A5;
hereby
assume s >= ( d . t );
then ( d . t ) in ( downarrow s ) by WAYBEL_0:17;
then t in ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) by FUNCT_2:38;
hence ( g . s ) >= t by A10,LATTICE3:def 9;
end;
d preserves_sup_of ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) by A2,WAYBEL_0:def 33;
then ( ex_sup_of ( d .: ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) ),S & ( d . ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) ) ) = ( sup ( d .: ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) ) )) by A9,WAYBEL_0:def 31;
then ( d . ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) ) ) <= ( sup ( downarrow s ) ) by A8,FUNCT_1:75,YELLOW_0:34;
then A11: ( d . ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) ) ) <= s by WAYBEL_0:34;
assume ( g . s ) >= t;
then ( d . ( g . s ) ) >= ( d . t ) by A6,CKB2:def 1;
then ( d . ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) ) ) >= ( d . t ) by A5;
hence thesis by A11,ORDERS_2:3;
end;
take g;
g is  monotone
proof
let s1 being (Element of S);
let s2 being (Element of S);
assume s1 <= s2;
then A12: ( downarrow s1 ) c= ( downarrow s2 ) by WAYBEL_0:21;
( ex_sup_of ( d " ( downarrow s1 ) ),T &  ex_sup_of ( d " ( downarrow s2 ) ),T) by A1,YELLOW_0:17;
then ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s1 ) ) ) <= ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s2 ) ) ) by A12,RELAT_1:143,YELLOW_0:34;
then ( g . s1 ) <= ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s2 ) ) ) by A5;
hence ( g . s1 ) <= ( g . s2 ) by A5;
end;
hence [ g,d ] is  Galois by A6,A7,CKB23:1;
let s being (Element of S);
thus A13:  ex_sup_of ( d " ( downarrow s ) ),T by A1,YELLOW_0:17;
thus A14: ( g . s ) = ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) ) by A5;
A15:  ex_sup_of ( downarrow s ),S by WAYBEL_0:34;
d preserves_sup_of ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) by A2,WAYBEL_0:def 33;
then ( ex_sup_of ( d .: ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) ),S & ( d . ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) ) ) = ( sup ( d .: ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) ) )) by A13,WAYBEL_0:def 31;
then ( d . ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) ) ) <= ( sup ( downarrow s ) ) by A15,FUNCT_1:75,YELLOW_0:34;
then ( d . ( sup ( d " ( downarrow s ) ) ) ) <= s by WAYBEL_0:34;
then ( d . ( g . s ) ) <= s by A5;
then ( d . ( g . s ) ) in ( downarrow s ) by WAYBEL_0:17;
hence thesis by A14,FUNCT_2:38;
