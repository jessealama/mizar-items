scheme RealContinuity { P[set],Q[set] } : (ex z st (for x holds (for y holds ((P[ x ] & Q[ y ]) implies (x <= z & z <= y)))))
provided
A1: (for x holds (for y holds ((P[ x ] & Q[ y ]) implies x <= y)))
proof
set Y = { z where z is (Element of ( REAL )): Q[ z ] };
set X = { z where z is (Element of ( REAL )): P[ z ] };
A2: X c= ( REAL )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in X;
then (ex z being (Element of ( REAL )) st (z = x & P[ z ]));
hence thesis;
end;
Y c= ( REAL )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in Y;
then (ex z being (Element of ( REAL )) st (z = x & Q[ z ]));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider X,Y as (Subset of ( REAL )) by A2;
(for x,y being  real number holds ((x in X & y in Y) implies x <= y))
proof
let x being  real number;
let y being  real number;
assume that
A3: x in X
and
A4: y in Y;
A5: (ex z being (Element of ( REAL )) st (z = y & Q[ z ])) by A4;
(ex z being (Element of ( REAL )) st (z = x & P[ z ])) by A3;
hence thesis by A1,A5;
end;
then consider z being  real number such that A6: (for x,y being  real number holds ((x in X & y in Y) implies (x <= z & z <= y))) by AXIOMS:1;
take z;
let x;
let y;
assume that
A7: P[ x ]
and
A8: Q[ y ];
y is (Element of ( REAL )) by XREAL_0:def 1;
then A9: y in Y by A8;
x is (Element of ( REAL )) by XREAL_0:def 1;
then x in X by A7;
hence thesis by A6,A9;
