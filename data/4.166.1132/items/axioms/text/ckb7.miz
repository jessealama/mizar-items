begin
reserve x for  real number;
theorem
(for A being (Subset of ( REAL )) holds ((( 0 ) in A & (for x holds (x in A implies ( x + 1 ) in A))) implies ( NAT ) c= A))
proof
let A being (Subset of ( REAL ));
assume that
A1: ( 0 ) in A
and
A2: (for x holds (x in A implies ( x + 1 ) in A));
reconsider B = ( A /\ ( REAL+ ) ) as (Subset of ( REAL+ )) by XBOOLE_1:17;
A3: B c= A by XBOOLE_1:17;
A4: (for x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) holds ((x9 in B & y9 = 1) implies ( x9 + y9 ) in B))
proof
let x9 being (Element of ( REAL+ ));
let y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ ));
assume that
A5: x9 in B
and
A6: y9 = 1;
x9 in ( REAL+ );
then reconsider x = x9 as (Element of ( REAL )) by ARYTM_0:1;
reconsider xx = x as  real number by XREAL_0:def 1;
( xx + 1 ) in A by A2,A3,A5;
then ((ex x99,y99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = x99 & 1 = y99) & ( + (x,1) ) = ( x99 + y99 ))) & ( + (x,1) ) in A) by CKB3:1,ARYTM_0:def 1,ARYTM_2:20;
hence thesis by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
( 0 ) in B by A1,ARYTM_2:20,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then ( NAT ) c= B by A4,ARYTM_2:17;
hence thesis by A3,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
