theorem
Th17: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( Fcl (( A \/ B ),n) ) = ( ( Fcl (A,n) ) \/ ( Fcl (B,n) ) ))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
(for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( ( Fcl ( A \/ B ) ) . n ) = ( ( ( Fcl A ) . n ) \/ ( ( Fcl B ) . n ) ))
proof
defpred P[ (Element of ( NAT )) ]
 means
( ( Fcl ( A \/ B ) ) . $1 ) = ( ( ( Fcl A ) . $1 ) \/ ( ( Fcl B ) . $1 ) );
A1: (for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (P[ k ] implies P[ ( k + 1 ) ]))
proof
let k being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume A2: P[ k ];
( ( Fcl ( A \/ B ) ) . ( k + 1 ) ) = ( ( Fcl (( A \/ B ),k) ) ^b ) by CKB14:def 1
.= ( ( ( Fcl (A,k) ) ^b ) \/ ( ( Fcl (B,k) ) ^b ) ) by A2,CKB9:1
.= ( ( Fcl (A,( k + 1 )) ) \/ ( ( Fcl (B,k) ) ^b ) ) by CKB14:def 1
.= ( ( ( Fcl A ) . ( k + 1 ) ) \/ ( ( Fcl B ) . ( k + 1 ) ) ) by CKB14:def 1;
hence thesis;
