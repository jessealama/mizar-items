definition
let T being non empty RelStr;
let A being (Subset of T);
func Fint A -> (Function of ( NAT ),( bool (the carrier of T) ))
means
:Def4: ((for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for B being (Subset of T) holds (B = ( it . n ) implies ( it . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( B ^i )))) & ( it . ( 0 ) ) = A);
existence
proof
defpred P[ set,set,set ]
 means
(for B being (Subset of T) holds (B = $2 implies $3 = ( B ^i )));
A1: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for x being (Subset of T) holds (ex y being (Subset of T) st P[ n,x,y ])))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
let x being (Subset of T);
reconsider C = x as (Subset of T);
(for B being (Subset of T) holds (B = x implies ( C ^i ) = ( B ^i )));
hence thesis;

(ex f being (Function of ( NAT ),( bool (the carrier of T) )) st (( f . ( 0 ) ) = A & (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ n,( f . n ),( f . ( n + 1 ) ) ]))) from RECDEF_1:sch 2(A1);

uniqueness
proof
let f1 being (Function of ( NAT ),( bool (the carrier of T) )),f2 being (Function of ( NAT ),( bool (the carrier of T) ));
assume that
A2: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for B being (Subset of T) holds (B = ( f1 . n ) implies ( f1 . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( B ^i ))))
and
A3: ( f1 . ( 0 ) ) = A
and
A4: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for B being (Subset of T) holds (B = ( f2 . n ) implies ( f2 . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( B ^i ))))
and
A5: ( f2 . ( 0 ) ) = A;
defpred P[ (Element of ( NAT )) ]
 means
( f1 . $1 ) = ( f2 . $1 );
A6: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (P[ n ] implies P[ ( n + 1 ) ]))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume A7: P[ n ];
reconsider B1 = ( f1 . n ) as (Subset of T);
( B1 ^i ) = ( f1 . ( n + 1 ) ) by A2;
hence thesis by A4,A7;
end;
A8: ( dom f1 ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A9: ( dom f1 ) = ( dom f2 ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A10: P[ ( 0 ) ] by A3,A5;
(for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ n ]) from NAT_1:sch 1(A10,A6);
then (for x being set holds (x in ( dom f1 ) implies ( f1 . x ) = ( f2 . x ))) by A8;
hence f1 = f2 by A9,FUNCT_1:2;
