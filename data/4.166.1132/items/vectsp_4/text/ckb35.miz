theorem
Th38: (for W1,W2 being  strict (Subspace of V) holds ((for v holds (v in W1 iff v in W2)) implies W1 = W2))
proof
let W1 being  strict (Subspace of V);
let W2 being  strict (Subspace of V);
assume A1: (for v holds (v in W1 iff v in W2));
(x in (the carrier of W1) iff x in (the carrier of W2))
proof
thus (x in (the carrier of W1) implies x in (the carrier of W2))
proof
assume A2: x in (the carrier of W1);
(the carrier of W1) c= (the carrier of V) by CKB10:def 1;
then reconsider v = x as (Element of V) by A2;
v in W1 by A2,STRUCT_0:def 5;
then v in W2 by A1;
hence thesis by STRUCT_0:def 5;
end;

assume A3: x in (the carrier of W2);
(the carrier of W2) c= (the carrier of V) by CKB10:def 1;
then reconsider v = x as (Element of V) by A3;
v in W2 by A3,STRUCT_0:def 5;
then v in W1 by A1;
hence thesis by STRUCT_0:def 5;
end;
then (the carrier of W1) = (the carrier of W2) by TARSKI:1;
hence thesis by CKB34:1;
end;
