theorem
Th2: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (for B being (ManySortedSet of T) holds ((for x being (Element of T) holds ( B . x ) is (Basis of x)) implies ( Union B ) is (Basis of T))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
let B being (ManySortedSet of T);
assume A1: (for x being (Element of T) holds ( B . x ) is (Basis of x));
( Union B ) c= ( bool (the carrier of T) )
proof
let a;
assume a in ( Union B );
then consider b such that A2: b in ( dom B ) and A3: a in ( B . b ) by CARD_5:2;
reconsider b as (Point of T) by A2,PARTFUN1:def 2;
( B . b ) is (Basis of b) by A1;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
then reconsider W = ( Union B ) as (Subset-Family of T);
A4: ( dom B ) = (the carrier of T) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
A5:now
let A being (Subset of T);
assume that
A6: A is  open;
let p being (Point of T);
assume that
A7: p in A;
A8: ( B . p ) is (Basis of p) by A1;
then consider a being (Subset of T) such that A9: a in ( B . p ) and A10: a c= A by A6,A7,YELLOW_8:def 1;
take a;
thus a in W by A4,A9,CARD_5:2;
thus p in a by A8,A9,YELLOW_8:12;
thus a c= A by A10;
end;
W c= (the topology of T)
proof
let a;
assume a in W;
then consider b such that A11: b in ( dom B ) and A12: a in ( B . b ) by CARD_5:2;
reconsider b as (Point of T) by A11,PARTFUN1:def 2;
( B . b ) is (Basis of b) by A1;
then ( B . b ) c= (the topology of T) by TOPS_2:64;
hence thesis by A12;
end;
hence thesis by A5,YELLOW_9:32;
