theorem
Th17: (for T being  finite-weight non  empty TopSpace holds (ex B0 being (Basis of T) st (ex f being (Function of (the carrier of T),(the topology of T)) st (B0 = ( rng f ) & (for x being (Point of T) holds (x in ( f . x ) & (for U being  open (Subset of T) holds (x in U implies ( f . x ) c= U))))))))
proof
let T being  finite-weight non  empty TopSpace;
consider B being (Basis of T) such that A1: ( card B ) = ( weight T ) by WAYBEL23:74;
deffunc F(set) = ( meet { U where U is (Subset of T): ($1 in U & U in B) } );
A2: B is  finite by A1,CKB18:def 1;
A3:now
B c= (the topology of T) by TOPS_2:64;
then ( FinMeetCl B ) c= ( FinMeetCl (the topology of T) ) by CANTOR_1:14;
then A4: ( FinMeetCl B ) c= (the topology of T) by CANTOR_1:5;
let a;
assume a in (the carrier of T);
then reconsider x = a as (Point of T);
set S = { U where U is (Subset of T): (x in U & U in B) };
consider U being (Subset of T) such that A5: U in B and A6: x in U and U c= ( [#] T ) by YELLOW_9:31;
A7: S c= B
proof
let a;
assume a in S;
then (ex U being (Subset of T) st ((a = U & x in U) & U in B));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider S as (Subset-Family of T) by XBOOLE_1:1;
( Intersect S ) in ( FinMeetCl B ) by A2,A7,CANTOR_1:def 3;
then A8: ( Intersect S ) in (the topology of T) by A4;
U in S by A5,A6;
hence F(a) in (the topology of T) by A8,SETFAM_1:def 9;
end;
consider f being (Function of (the carrier of T),(the topology of T)) such that A9: (for a holds (a in (the carrier of T) implies ( f . a ) = F(a))) from FUNCT_2:sch 2(A3);
set B0 = ( rng f );
reconsider B0 as (Subset-Family of T) by XBOOLE_1:1;
A10:now
let a;
assume a in (the carrier of T);
then reconsider x = a as (Point of T);

consider U being (Subset of T) such that A11: U in B and A12: x in U and U c= ( [#] T ) by YELLOW_9:31;
A13:now
let b;
assume b in S;
then (ex U being (Subset of T) st ((b = U & a in U) & U in B));
hence a in b;
end;
A14: ( f . a ) = ( meet S ) by A9;
U in S by A11,A12;
hence a in ( f . a ) by A14,A13,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
A15:now
let x being (Point of T);
let V being (Subset of T);
set S = { U where U is (Subset of T): (x in U & U in B) };
assume that
A16: x in V
and
A17: V is  open;
consider U being (Subset of T) such that A18: U in B and A19: x in U and A20: U c= V by A16,A17,YELLOW_9:31;
A21: ( f . x ) = ( meet S ) by A9;
U in S by A18,A19;
then ( f . x ) c= U by A21,SETFAM_1:3;
hence ( f . x ) c= V by A20,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
now
let A being (Subset of T);
assume A22: A is  open;
let p being (Point of T);
assume A23: p in A;
( f . p ) in (the topology of T);
then reconsider a = ( f . p ) as (Subset of T);
take a;
thus a in B0 by FUNCT_2:4;
thus p in a by A10;
thus a c= A by A15,A22,A23;
end;
then reconsider B0 as (Basis of T) by YELLOW_9:32;
take B0;
take f;
thus B0 = ( rng f );
let x being (Point of T);
thus thesis by A10,A15;
