theorem
Lm4: (for T being  infinite-weight TopSpace holds (for B being (Basis of T) holds (ex B1 being (Basis of T) st (B1 c= B & ( card B1 ) = ( weight T )))))
proof
let T being  infinite-weight TopSpace;
let B being (Basis of T);
consider B0 being (Basis of T) such that A1: ( card B0 ) = ( weight T ) by WAYBEL23:74;
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(( union $2 ) = $1 & ( card $2 ) c= ( weight T ));
A2:now
let a;
set Sa = { U where U is (Subset of T): (U in B & U c= a) };
A3: Sa c= B
proof
let b;
assume b in Sa;
then (ex U being (Subset of T) st ((b = U & U in B) & U c= a));
hence thesis;
end;
assume a in B0;
then reconsider W = a as  open (Subset of T) by YELLOW_8:10;
A4: ( union Sa ) = W by YELLOW_8:9;
reconsider Sa as  open (Subset-Family of T) by A3,TOPS_2:11,XBOOLE_1:1;
consider G being  open (Subset-Family of T) such that A5: G c= Sa and A6: ( union G ) = ( union Sa ) and A7: ( card G ) c= ( weight T ) by CKB17:1;
reconsider b = G as set;
take b;
b c= B by A3,A5,XBOOLE_1:1;
hence b in ( bool B );
thus P[ a,b ] by A4,A6,A7;
end;
consider f being Function such that A8: (( dom f ) = B0 & ( rng f ) c= ( bool B )) and A9: (for a holds (a in B0 implies P[ a,( f . a ) ])) from FUNCT_1:sch 5(A2);
A10: ( Union f ) c= ( union ( bool B ) ) by A8,ZFMISC_1:77;
then A11: ( Union f ) c= B by ZFMISC_1:81;
then reconsider B1 = ( Union f ) as (Subset-Family of T) by XBOOLE_1:1;
now
B c= (the topology of T) by TOPS_2:64;
hence B1 c= (the topology of T) by A11,XBOOLE_1:1;
let A being (Subset of T);
assume that
A12: A is  open;
let p being (Point of T);
assume p in A;
then consider U being (Subset of T) such that A13: U in B0 and A14: p in U and A15: U c= A by A12,YELLOW_9:31;
A16: P[ U,( f . U ) ] by A9,A13;
then consider a such that A17: p in a and A18: a in ( f . U ) by A14,TARSKI:def 4;
A19: a c= U by A16,A18,ZFMISC_1:74;
a in B1 by A8,A13,A18,CARD_5:2;
hence (ex a being (Subset of T) st ((a in B1 & p in a) & a c= A)) by A15,A17,A19,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
then reconsider B1 as (Basis of T) by YELLOW_9:32;
now
thus ( card ( rng f ) ) c= ( weight T ) by A1,A8,CARD_1:12;
let a;
assume a in ( rng f );
then (ex b st (b in ( dom f ) & a = ( f . b ))) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence ( card a ) c= ( weight T ) by A8,A9;
end;
then A20: ( card B1 ) c= ( ( weight T ) *` ( weight T ) ) by CARD_2:87;
take B1;
thus B1 c= B by A10,ZFMISC_1:81;
( weight T ) is  infinite by CKB18:def 1;
hence ( card B1 ) c= ( weight T ) by A20,CARD_4:15;
thus thesis by WAYBEL23:73;
