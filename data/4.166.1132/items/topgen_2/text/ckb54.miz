theorem
(for X being set holds (for O being (Subset-Family of ( bool X )) holds ((for o being (Subset-Family of X) holds (o in O implies TopStruct (# X,o #) is TopSpace)) implies (ex B being (Subset-Family of X) st (((B = ( Intersect O ) & TopStruct (# X,B #) is TopSpace) & (for o being (Subset-Family of X) holds (o in O implies TopStruct (# X,o #) is (TopExtension of TopStruct (# X,B #))))) & (for T being TopSpace holds (((the carrier of T) = X & (for o being (Subset-Family of X) holds (o in O implies TopStruct (# X,o #) is (TopExtension of T)))) implies TopStruct (# X,B #) is (TopExtension of T))))))))
proof
let X being set;
let O being (Subset-Family of ( bool X ));
assume that
A1: (for o being (Subset-Family of X) holds (o in O implies TopStruct (# X,o #) is TopSpace));
reconsider B = ( Intersect O ) as (Subset-Family of X);
set T = TopStruct (# X,B #);
take B;
thus B = ( Intersect O );
A2: T is  TopSpace-like
proof
now
thus (the carrier of T) in ( bool (the carrier of T) ) by ZFMISC_1:def 1;
let a;
assume A3: a in O;
then reconsider o = a as (Subset-Family of X);
TopStruct (# X,o #) is TopSpace by A1,A3;
hence (the carrier of T) in a by PRE_TOPC:def 1;
end;
hence (the carrier of T) in (the topology of T) by SETFAM_1:43;
hereby
let a being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A4: a c= (the topology of T);
now
let b;
assume A5: b in O;
then reconsider o = b as (Subset-Family of X);
B c= b by A5,MSSUBFAM:2;
then A6: a c= o by A4,XBOOLE_1:1;
TopStruct (# X,o #) is TopSpace by A1,A5;
hence ( union a ) in b by A6,PRE_TOPC:def 1;
end;
hence ( union a ) in (the topology of T) by SETFAM_1:43;
end;
let a being (Subset of T);
let b being (Subset of T);
assume that
A7: a in (the topology of T)
and
A8: b in (the topology of T);
now
let c;
assume A9: c in O;
then reconsider o = c as (Subset-Family of X);
A10: b in o by A8,A9,SETFAM_1:43;
A11: TopStruct (# X,o #) is TopSpace by A1,A9;
a in o by A7,A9,SETFAM_1:43;
hence ( a /\ b ) in c by A10,A11,PRE_TOPC:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by SETFAM_1:43;
end;
hence T is TopSpace;
thus (for o being (Subset-Family of X) holds (o in O implies TopStruct (# X,o #) is (TopExtension of T)))
proof
let o being (Subset-Family of X);
assume that
A12: o in O;
reconsider S = TopStruct (# X,o #) as TopSpace by A1,A12;
( Intersect O ) c= o by A12,MSSUBFAM:2;
then S is (TopExtension of T) by YELLOW_9:def 5;
hence thesis;
end;

reconsider TT = T as TopSpace by A2;
let T9 being TopSpace;
assume that
A13: (the carrier of T9) = X
and
A14: (for o being (Subset-Family of X) holds (o in O implies TopStruct (# X,o #) is (TopExtension of T9)));
now
let a;
assume A15: a in O;
then reconsider o = a as (Subset-Family of X);
TopStruct (# X,o #) is (TopExtension of T9) by A14,A15;
hence (the topology of T9) c= a by YELLOW_9:def 5;
end;
then (the topology of T9) c= ( Intersect O ) by A13,MSSUBFAM:4;
then TT is (TopExtension of T9) by A13,YELLOW_9:def 5;
hence thesis;
end;
