theorem
(for L being  up-complete  lower-bounded LATTICE holds (for X being (Subset of L) holds (X is  order-generating iff (for Y being (Subset of L) holds ((X c= Y & (for Z being (Subset of Y) holds ( "/\" (Z,L) ) in Y)) implies (the carrier of L) = Y)))))
proof
let L being  up-complete  lower-bounded LATTICE;
let X being (Subset of L);
thus (X is  order-generating implies (for Y being (Subset of L) holds ((X c= Y & (for Z being (Subset of Y) holds ( "/\" (Z,L) ) in Y)) implies (the carrier of L) = Y)))
