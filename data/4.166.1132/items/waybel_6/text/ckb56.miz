theorem
Th37: (for L being  continuous  complete LATTICE holds ((for l being (Element of L) holds (ex X being (Subset of L) st (l = ( sup X ) & (for x being (Element of L) holds (x in X implies x is  co-prime))))) implies (for l being (Element of L) holds l = ( "\/" (( ( waybelow l ) /\ ( PRIME ( L opp ) ) ),L) ))))
proof
let L being  continuous  complete LATTICE;
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
($2 c= ( PRIME ( L ~ ) ) & $1 = ( "\/" ($2,L) ));
assume A1: (for l being (Element of L) holds (ex X being (Subset of L) st (l = ( sup X ) & (for x being (Element of L) holds (x in X implies x is  co-prime)))));
A2: (for e being set holds (e in (the carrier of L) implies (ex u being set st P[ e,u ])))
proof
let e being set;
assume e in (the carrier of L);
then reconsider l = e as (Element of L);
consider X being (Subset of L) such that A3: l = ( sup X ) and A4: (for x being (Element of L) holds (x in X implies x is  co-prime)) by A1;
now
let p1 being set;
assume A5: p1 in X;
then reconsider p = p1 as (Element of L);
p is  co-prime by A4,A5;
then ( p ~ ) is  prime by CKB37:def 1;
hence p1 in ( PRIME ( L ~ ) ) by CKB36:def 1;
end;
then X c= ( PRIME ( L ~ ) ) by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis by A3;
end;

A9: ( waybelow l ) c= { ( sup X ) where X is (Subset of L): (X in ( rng f ) & ( sup X ) in ( waybelow l )) }
proof
let e being set;

then ( f . e ) c= ( PRIME ( L ~ ) ) by A7;
then A11: ( f . e ) c= (the carrier of ( L ~ )) by XBOOLE_1:1;
(e = ( "\/" (( f . e ),L) ) & ( f . e ) in ( rng f )) by A6,A7,A10,FUNCT_1:def 3;

A13: Z c= ( ( waybelow l ) /\ ( PRIME ( L ~ ) ) )
proof
let e being set;
assume e in Z;
then consider Y being set such that A14: e in Y and A15: Y in { X where X is (Subset of L): (X in ( rng f ) & ( sup X ) in ( waybelow l )) } by TARSKI:def 4;

reconsider e1 = e as (Element of L) by A14,A16;
e1 <= ( sup X ) by A14,A16,YELLOW_2:22;

(ex r being set st (r in ( dom f ) & X = ( f . r ))) by A17,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then X c= ( PRIME ( L ~ ) ) by A6,A7;
hence thesis by A14,A16,A19,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;

{ ( sup X ) where X is (Subset of L): P[ X ] } c= ( waybelow l )
proof
let e being set;
assume e in { ( sup X ) where X is (Subset of L): (X in ( rng f ) & ( sup X ) in ( waybelow l )) };
then (ex X being (Subset of L) st ((e = ( sup X ) & X in ( rng f )) & ( sup X ) in ( waybelow l )));
hence thesis;
