theorem
Th4: (for S,T being  complete LATTICE holds (for f being  sups-preserving (Function of S,T) holds ((T is  meet-continuous & f is  meet-preserving  one-to-one) implies S is  meet-continuous)))
proof
let S being  complete LATTICE;
let T being  complete LATTICE;
let f being  sups-preserving (Function of S,T);
assume that
A1: T is  meet-continuous
and
A2: f is  meet-preserving  one-to-one;
S is  satisfying_MC
proof
let x being (Element of S);
let D being non  empty  directed (Subset of S);

A7: ( { ( f . x ) } "/\" ( f .: D ) ) c= ( f .: ( { x } "/\" D ) )
proof
let p being set;
assume p in ( { ( f . x ) } "/\" ( f .: D ) );
then consider y being (Element of T) such that A8: p = ( ( f . x ) "/\" y ) and A9: y in ( f .: D ) by A6;
consider k being set such that A10: k in ( dom f ) and A11: k in D and A12: y = ( f . k ) by A9,FUNCT_1:def 6;
reconsider k as (Element of S) by A10;
( x "/\" k ) in { ( x "/\" a ) where a is (Element of S): a in D } by A11;
then A13: ( x "/\" k ) in ( { x } "/\" D ) by YELLOW_4:42;
f preserves_inf_of { x,k } by A2,WAYBEL_0:def 34;
then p = ( f . ( x "/\" k ) ) by A8,A12,YELLOW_3:8;

proof
let p being set;
assume p in ( f .: ( { x } "/\" D ) );
then consider m being set such that A16: m in ( dom f ) and A17: m in ( { x } "/\" D ) and A18: p = ( f . m ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
reconsider m as (Element of S) by A16;
consider a being (Element of S) such that A19: m = ( x "/\" a ) and A20: a in D by A14,A17;
reconsider fa = ( f . a ) as (Element of T);
f preserves_inf_of { x,a } by A2,WAYBEL_0:def 34;
then A21: p = ( ( f . x ) "/\" fa ) by A18,A19,YELLOW_3:8;
