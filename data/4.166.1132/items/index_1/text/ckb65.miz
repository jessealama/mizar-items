theorem
Th16: (for C being Category holds (for D being  Categorial Category holds (for F being (Functor of C,D) holds [ ( Obj F ),( pr2 F ) ] is (Indexing of C))))
proof
let C being Category;
let D being  Categorial Category;
let F being (Functor of C,D);
set I = [ ( Obj F ),( pr2 F ) ];
A1: ( I `1 ) = ( Obj F ) by MCART_1:7;
A2: ( dom F ) = (the carrier' of C) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
( dom ( Obj F ) ) = (the carrier of C) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A3: ( Obj F ) is (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of C)) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
A4: ( I `2 ) = ( pr2 F ) by MCART_1:7;
A5: ( dom ( pr2 F ) ) = ( dom F ) by MCART_1:def 13;
then ( pr2 F ) is (ManySortedSet of (the carrier' of C)) by A2,PARTFUN1:def 2,RELAT_1:def 18;
then reconsider I as (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of C),(the carrier' of C)) by A3,CKB22:def 1;
( pr2 F ) is  Function-yielding
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( dom ( pr2 F ) );
then reconsider x as (Morphism of C) by A2,MCART_1:def 13;
reconsider m = ( F . x ) as (Morphism of D);
( ( pr2 F ) . x ) = ( m `2 ) by A2,MCART_1:def 13;
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider FF = ( pr2 F ) as (ManySortedFunction of (the carrier' of C)) by A5,A2,PARTFUN1:def 2,RELAT_1:def 18;
( I `1 ) is  Category-yielding by MCART_1:7;
then reconsider I as  Category-yielding_on_first (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of C),(the carrier' of C)) by CKB30:def 1;
FF is (ManySortedFunctor of ( ( I `1 ) * (the Source of C) ),( ( I `1 ) * (the Target of C) ))
proof
let m being (Morphism of C);
reconsider x = ( F . m ) as (Morphism of D);
A6: ( x `11 ) = ( dom ( F . m ) ) by CAT_5:13;
( x `12 ) = ( cod ( F . m ) ) by CAT_5:13;
then consider f being (Functor of ( x `11 ),( x `12 )) such that A7: ( F . m ) = [ [ ( x `11 ),( x `12 ) ],f ] by A6,CAT_5:def 6;
A8: ( ( ( Obj F ) * (the Source of C) ) . m ) = ( ( Obj F ) . ( dom m ) ) by FUNCT_2:15

( FF . m ) = ( x `2 ) by A2,MCART_1:def 13
.= f by A7,MCART_1:7;
hence thesis by A1,A6,A8,A9,CAT_5:13;

A14: ( dom h2 ) = ( h2 `11 ) by CAT_5:13;

let a being (Object of C);
reconsider i = ( ( Obj F ) . a ) as (Object of D);
