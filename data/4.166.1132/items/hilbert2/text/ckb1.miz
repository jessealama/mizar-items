theorem
Th1: (for Z being set holds (for M being (ManySortedSet of Z) holds ((for x being set holds (x in Z implies ( M . x ) is (ManySortedSet of x))) implies (for f being Function holds (f = ( Union M ) implies ( dom f ) = ( union Z ))))))
proof
let Z being set;
let M being (ManySortedSet of Z);
assume that
A1: (for x being set holds (x in Z implies ( M . x ) is (ManySortedSet of x)));
let f being Function;
assume f = ( Union M );
then A2: f = ( union ( rng M ) ) by CARD_3:def 4;
(for x being set holds (x in ( dom f ) iff (ex Y being set st (x in Y & Y in Z))))
proof
let x being set;
thus (x in ( dom f ) implies (ex Y being set st (x in Y & Y in Z)))
proof
assume x in ( dom f );
then [ x,( f . x ) ] in f by FUNCT_1:def 2;
then consider g being set such that A3: [ x,( f . x ) ] in g and A4: g in ( rng M ) by A2,TARSKI:def 4;
consider a being set such that A5: a in ( dom M ) and A6: g = ( M . a ) by A4,FUNCT_1:def 3;
A7: a in Z by A5,PARTFUN1:def 2;
then reconsider g as (ManySortedSet of a) by A1,A6;
take ( dom g );
thus x in ( dom g ) by A3,FUNCT_1:1;
thus thesis by A7,PARTFUN1:def 2;
end;

given Y being set such that
A8: x in Y
and
A9: Y in Z;

reconsider g = ( M . Y ) as (ManySortedSet of Y) by A1,A9;
Y = ( dom g ) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
then A10: [ x,( g . x ) ] in g by A8,FUNCT_1:1;
Z = ( dom M ) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
then g in ( rng M ) by A9,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then [ x,( g . x ) ] in f by A2,A10,TARSKI:def 4;
hence thesis by FUNCT_1:1;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 4;
