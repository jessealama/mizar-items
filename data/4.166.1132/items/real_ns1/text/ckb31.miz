theorem
Th16: (for n being Nat holds (for seq1 being (sequence of ( REAL-NS n )) holds (for seq2 being (sequence of ( REAL-US n )) holds (seq1 = seq2 implies ((seq1 is  convergent implies (seq2 is  convergent & ( lim seq1 ) = ( lim seq2 ))) & (seq2 is  convergent implies (seq1 is  convergent & ( lim seq1 ) = ( lim seq2 ))))))))
proof
let n being Nat;
let seq1 being (sequence of ( REAL-NS n ));
let seq2 being (sequence of ( REAL-US n ));
assume A1: seq1 = seq2;
A2: (the carrier of ( REAL-NS n )) = ( REAL n ) by CKB6:def 1
.= (the carrier of ( REAL-US n )) by CKB25:def 1;
now
reconsider LIMIT = ( lim seq1 ) as (Point of ( REAL-US n )) by A2;
assume A3: seq1 is  convergent;
then consider RNg being (Point of ( REAL-NS n )) such that A4: (for r being Real holds (( 0 ) < r implies (ex m being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m <= k implies ||. ( ( seq1 . k ) - RNg ) .|| < r))))) by NORMSP_1:def 6;
reconsider RUg = RNg as (Point of ( REAL-US n )) by A2;
(for r being Real holds (( 0 ) < r implies (ex m being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m <= k implies ( dist (( seq2 . k ),RUg) ) < r)))))
proof
let r being Real;
assume ( 0 ) < r;
then consider m being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A5: (for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m <= k implies ||. ( ( seq1 . k ) - RNg ) .|| < r)) by A4;
take m;

assume A6: m <= k;
( - RNg ) = ( - RUg ) by CKB28:1;

hence A8: seq2 is  convergent by BHSP_2:def 1;
(for r being Real holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex m being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (k >= m implies ( dist (( seq2 . k ),LIMIT) ) < r)))))
proof
let r being Real;

end;
hence thesis;
end;
hence ( lim seq2 ) = ( lim seq1 ) by A8,BHSP_2:def 2;

hence (seq1 is  convergent implies (seq2 is  convergent & ( lim seq1 ) = ( lim seq2 )));
now

hence thesis by A15,A16,CKB8:1;

hence thesis;
end;
hence A17: seq1 is  convergent by NORMSP_1:def 6;
(for r being Real holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex m being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (k >= m implies ||. ( ( seq1 . k ) - LIMIT ) .|| < r)))))
proof
let r being Real;
