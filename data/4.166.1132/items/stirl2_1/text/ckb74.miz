theorem
Th69: (for N being  finite (Subset of ( NAT )) holds (ex Order being (Function of N,( card N )) st (Order is  bijective & (for n holds (for k holds (((n in ( dom Order ) & k in ( dom Order )) & n < k) implies ( Order . n ) < ( Order . k )))))))
proof
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
(for N being  finite (Subset of ( NAT )) holds (( card N ) = $1 implies (ex F being (Function of N,( card N )) st (F is  bijective & (for n holds (for k holds (((n in ( dom F ) & k in ( dom F )) & n < k) implies ( F . n ) < ( F . k ))))))));
A1: (for k holds (P[ k ] implies P[ ( k + 1 ) ]))
proof
let k;
assume that
A2: P[ k ];
let N being  finite (Subset of ( NAT ));
assume that
A3: ( card N ) = ( k + 1 );
defpred M[ set ]
 means
$1 in N;
(ex x st x in N) by A3,CARD_1:27,XBOOLE_0:def 1;
then A4: (ex n being Nat st M[ n ]);
consider m9 being Nat such that A5: (for n holds (n in N implies n <= m9)) by CKB71:1;
A6: (for n being Nat holds (M[ n ] implies n <= m9)) by A5;
consider m being Nat such that A7: (M[ m ] & (for n being Nat holds (M[ n ] implies n <= m))) from NAT_1:sch 6(A6,A4);
set Nm = ( N \ { m } );
consider F being (Function of Nm,( card Nm )) such that A8: F is  bijective and A9: (for n holds (for k holds (((n in ( dom F ) & k in ( dom F )) & n < k) implies ( F . n ) < ( F . k )))) by A2,A3,A7,CKB69:1;
A10: ( card Nm ) = k by A3,A7,CKB69:1;
then A11: ( ( card Nm ) \/ { k } ) = ( card N ) by A3,AFINSQ_1:2;
A12: (( card Nm ) is  empty implies Nm is  empty);
m in { m } by TARSKI:def 1;
then (not m in Nm) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then consider G being (Function of ( Nm \/ { m } ),( ( card Nm ) \/ { k } )) such that A13: ( G | Nm ) = F and A14: ( G . m ) = k by A12,CKB72:1;
N = ( Nm \/ { m } ) by A7,ZFMISC_1:116;
then reconsider G9 = G as (Function of N,( card N )) by A3,A10,AFINSQ_1:2;
take G9;
(not k in ( card Nm )) by A10;
then G is  one-to-one  onto by A8,A12,A13,A14,CKB73:1;
hence G9 is  bijective by A11;
thus (for n holds (for k holds (((n in ( dom G9 ) & k in ( dom G9 )) & n < k) implies ( G9 . n ) < ( G9 . k ))))
proof
A15: (for i holds (i in Nm implies (i < m & ( G9 . i ) < k)))
proof
let i;
assume that
A16: i in Nm;
(not i in { m }) by A16,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then A17: i <> m by TARSKI:def 1;
M[ i ] by A16,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then A18: i <= m by A7;
i in ( dom F ) by A16,FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A19: ( F . i ) = ( G9 . i ) by A13,FUNCT_1:47;
( card Nm ) = k by A3,A7,CKB69:1;
hence thesis by A16,A19,A18,A17,NAT_1:44,XXREAL_0:1;
end;
let i;
let j;
assume that
A20: i in ( dom G9 )
and
A21: j in ( dom G9 )
and
A22: i < j;
A23: ( dom G9 ) = ( Nm \/ { m } ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
now
per cases  by A20,A21,A23,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A24: (i in Nm & j in Nm);

then A25: j in ( dom F ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A26: ( F . j ) = ( G9 . j ) by A13,FUNCT_1:47;
A27: i in ( dom F ) by A24,FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( F . i ) = ( G9 . i ) by A13,FUNCT_1:47;
hence thesis by A9,A22,A27,A25,A26;
end;
suppose A28: (i in Nm & j in { m });

then ( G9 . i ) < k by A15;
hence thesis by A14,A28,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
suppose A29: (i in { m } & j in Nm);

then i = m by TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A22,A15,A29;
end;
suppose A30: (i in { m } & j in { m });

then i = m by TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A22,A30,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;

end;
A31: P[ ( 0 ) ]
proof
set P = ( {} );
A32: ( rng P ) = ( {} );
A33: ( dom P ) = ( {} );
let N being  finite (Subset of ( NAT ));
assume that
A34: ( card N ) = ( 0 );
N is  empty by A34;
then reconsider P as (Function of N,( card N )) by A34,A32,A33,FUNCT_2:1;
take P;
( rng P ) = ( {} );
then P is  one-to-one  onto by A34,FUNCT_2:def 3;
hence P is  bijective;
thus thesis;
end;
(for k holds P[ k ]) from NAT_1:sch 2(A31,A1);
hence thesis;
