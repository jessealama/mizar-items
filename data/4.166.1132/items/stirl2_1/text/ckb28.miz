theorem
Th23: (((n = ( 0 ) iff k = ( 0 )) & n >= k) implies (ex f being (Function of n,k) st f is  onto  "increasing))
proof
assume that
A1: (n = ( 0 ) iff k = ( 0 ))
and
A2: n >= k;
now
per cases ;
suppose A3: n = ( 0 );

set f = ( {} );
A4: ( dom f ) = n by A3;
( rng f ) = k by A1,A3;
then reconsider f as (Function of n,k) by A4,FUNCT_2:1;
f is  onto  "increasing by A1,CKB20:1;
hence thesis;
end;
suppose A5: n > ( 0 );

then reconsider k1 = ( k - 1 ) as (Element of ( NAT )) by A1,NAT_1:20;
reconsider k,n as non  empty (Element of ( NAT )) by A1,A5,ORDINAL1:def 12;
defpred F[ (Element of n),(Element of k) ]
 means
$2 = ( min ($1,k1) );
A6: (for x being (Element of n) holds (ex y being (Element of k) st F[ x,y ]))
proof
let x being (Element of n);
A7: k1 < ( k1 + 1 ) by NAT_1:13;
( min (x,k1) ) <= k1 by XXREAL_0:17;
then ( min (x,k1) ) < k by A7,XXREAL_0:2;
then ( min (x,k1) ) in k by NAT_1:44;
hence thesis;
end;
consider f being (Function of n,k) such that A8: (for m being (Element of n) holds F[ m,( f . m ) ]) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A6);
now
let m9 being set;
assume that
A9: m9 in k;
k is (Subset of ( NAT )) by CKB8:1;
then reconsider m = m9 as (Element of ( NAT )) by A9;
A10: m < ( k1 + 1 ) by A9,NAT_1:44;
then m < n by A2,XXREAL_0:2;
then A11: m in n by NAT_1:44;
then A12: m in ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
m <= k1 by A10,NAT_1:13;
then ( min (m,k1) ) = m by XXREAL_0:def 9;
then ( f . m ) = m by A8,A11;
hence m9 in ( rng f ) by A12,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;
then k c= ( rng f ) by TARSKI:def 3;
then k = ( rng f ) by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then A13: f is  onto by FUNCT_2:def 3;
A14: (for m holds (m in ( rng f ) implies ( min* ( f " { m } ) ) = m))
proof
let m;
assume m in ( rng f );
then A15: m < ( k1 + 1 ) by NAT_1:44;
then A16: m <= k1 by NAT_1:13;
m < n by A2,A15,XXREAL_0:2;
then A17: m in n by NAT_1:44;
then A18: m in ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
m <= k1 by A15,NAT_1:13;
then ( min (m,k1) ) = m by XXREAL_0:def 9;
then ( f . m ) = m by A8,A17;
then A19: ( f . m ) in { m } by TARSKI:def 1;
then A20: m in ( f " { m } ) by A18,FUNCT_1:def 7;
A21: ( f " { m } ) is non  empty by A19,A18,FUNCT_1:def 7;
now
per cases  by A16,XXREAL_0:1;
suppose A22: m < k1;

now
A23: n is (Subset of ( NAT )) by CKB8:1;
let l9 being set;
assume that
A24: l9 in ( f " { m } );
l9 in ( dom f ) by A24,FUNCT_1:def 7;
then l9 in n;
then reconsider l = l9 as (Element of ( NAT )) by A23;
( f . l ) in { m } by A24,FUNCT_1:def 7;
then A25: ( f . l ) = m by TARSKI:def 1;
l in ( dom f ) by A24,FUNCT_1:def 7;
then ( min (l,k1) ) = m by A8,A25;
then l = m by A22,XXREAL_0:15;
hence l9 in { m } by TARSKI:def 1;
end;
then A26: ( f " { m } ) c= { m } by TARSKI:def 3;
( min* ( f " { m } ) ) in ( f " { m } ) by A21,NAT_1:def 1;
hence thesis by A26,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
suppose A27: m = k1;

(for l being Nat holds (l in ( f " { m } ) implies m <= l))
proof
let l being Nat;
assume that
A28: l in ( f " { m } );
( f . l ) in { m } by A28,FUNCT_1:def 7;
then A29: ( f . l ) = m by TARSKI:def 1;
l in ( dom f ) by A28,FUNCT_1:def 7;
then ( f . l ) = ( min (l,m) ) by A8,A27;
hence thesis by A29,XXREAL_0:def 9;
end;
hence thesis by A20,NAT_1:def 1;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
now
let l;
let m;
assume that
A30: l in ( rng f )
and
A31: m in ( rng f )
and
A32: l < m;
( min* ( f " { l } ) ) = l by A14,A30;
hence ( min* ( f " { l } ) ) < ( min* ( f " { m } ) ) by A14,A31,A32;
end;
then f is  "increasing by CKB19:def 1;
hence thesis by A13;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
