theorem
Th39: (for f being (Function of n,k) holds (for g being (Function of ( n + 1 ),( k + m )) holds ((f is  onto  "increasing & f = ( g | n )) implies (for i holds (for j holds (((i in ( rng g ) & j in ( rng g )) & i < j) implies ( min* ( g " { i } ) ) < ( min* ( g " { j } ) )))))))
proof
let f being (Function of n,k);
let g being (Function of ( n + 1 ),( k + m ));
assume that
A1: f is  onto  "increasing
and
A2: f = ( g | n );
A3: (for i holds (i < n implies ( f . i ) = ( g . i )))
proof
(k = ( 0 ) iff n = ( 0 )) by A1,CKB19:def 1;
then A4: ( dom f ) = n by FUNCT_2:def 1;
let i;
assume i < n;
then i in n by NAT_1:44;

assume A11: l <> ( g . n );
( dom g ) = ( n + 1 ) by A7,FUNCT_2:def 1;
then reconsider x as (Element of ( NAT )) by A9,A6;
x < ( n + 1 ) by A9,NAT_1:44;
then x <= n by NAT_1:13;

assume A22: ( min* ( g " { l } ) ) <> n;
( min* ( g " { l } ) ) <= ( ( n + 1 ) - 1 ) by CKB21:1;

then A24: ( dom f ) = n by FUNCT_2:def 1;
( min* ( g " { l } ) ) in n by A23,NAT_1:44;
