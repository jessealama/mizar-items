theorem
Th37: (for f being (Function of ( n + 1 ),( k + 1 )) holds ((f is  onto  "increasing & ( f " { ( f . n ) } ) = { n }) implies (( rng ( f | n ) ) c= k & (for g being (Function of n,k) holds (g = ( f | n ) implies g is  onto  "increasing)))))
proof
let f being (Function of ( n + 1 ),( k + 1 ));
assume that
A1: f is  onto  "increasing
and
A2: ( f " { ( f . n ) } ) = { n };
now
per cases ;
suppose A3: n = ( 0 );

then ( ( 0 ) + 1 ) >= ( k + 1 ) by A1,CKB22:1;
then k = ( 0 ) by XREAL_1:6;
hence thesis by A3,CKB20:1;
end;
suppose A4: n > ( 0 );

thus A5: ( rng ( f | n ) ) c= k
proof
let fi being set;
assume that
A6: fi in ( rng ( f | n ) );
A7: fi in ( k + 1 ) by A6;
( k + 1 ) is (Subset of ( NAT )) by CKB8:1;
then reconsider fi as (Element of ( NAT )) by A7;
consider i being set such that A8: i in ( dom ( f | n ) ) and A9: ( ( f | n ) . i ) = fi by A6,FUNCT_1:def 3;
i in ( ( dom f ) /\ n ) by A8,RELAT_1:61;
then A10: i in n by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
n is (Subset of ( NAT )) by CKB8:1;
then reconsider i as (Element of ( NAT )) by A10;
A11: ( f . i ) < k
proof
( f . i ) < ( k + 1 ) by NAT_1:44;
then A12: ( f . i ) <= k by NAT_1:13;
assume ( f . i ) >= k;
then A13: ( f . i ) = k by A12,XXREAL_0:1;
A14: ( f . i ) in { ( f . i ) } by TARSKI:def 1;
A15: ( f . n ) = k by A1,A2,CKB44:1;
A16: i in ( ( dom f ) /\ n ) by A8,RELAT_1:61;
then i in ( dom f ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then i in ( f " { ( f . n ) } ) by A13,A14,A15,FUNCT_1:def 7;
then ((i >= ( min* ( f " { ( f . n ) } ) ) & i in ( NAT )) & n in ( NAT )) by NAT_1:def 1,ORDINAL1:def 12;
then A17: i >= n by A2,CKB5:1;
i in n by A16,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence contradiction by A17,NAT_1:44;
end;
( f . i ) = ( ( f | n ) . i ) by A8,FUNCT_1:47;
hence thesis by A9,A11,NAT_1:44;
end;

thus (for g being (Function of n,k) holds (g = ( f | n ) implies g is  onto  "increasing))
proof
let g being (Function of n,k);
assume that
A18: g = ( f | n );
k c= ( rng g )
proof
n < ( n + 1 ) by NAT_1:13;
then A19: n c= ( n + 1 ) by NAT_1:39;
( dom f ) = ( n + 1 ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A20: n = ( ( dom f ) /\ n ) by A19,XBOOLE_1:28;
let k1 being set;
assume that
A21: k1 in k;
k is (Subset of ( NAT )) by CKB8:1;
then reconsider k9 = k1 as (Element of ( NAT )) by A21;
k9 < k by A21,NAT_1:44;
then k9 < ( k + 1 ) by NAT_1:13;
then A22: k9 in ( k + 1 ) by NAT_1:44;
A23: ( dom f ) = ( n + 1 ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
( rng f ) = ( k + 1 ) by A1,FUNCT_2:def 3;
then consider n1 being set such that A24: n1 in ( dom f ) and A25: ( f . n1 ) = k9 by A22,FUNCT_1:def 3;
( n + 1 ) is (Subset of ( NAT )) by CKB8:1;
then reconsider n1 as (Element of ( NAT )) by A24,A23;
n1 < ( n + 1 ) by A24,NAT_1:44;
then A26: n1 <= n by NAT_1:13;
( f . n ) = k by A1,A2,CKB44:1;
then n1 <> n by A21,A25;
then A27: n1 < n by A26,XXREAL_0:1;
( ( dom f ) /\ n ) = ( dom ( f | n ) ) by RELAT_1:61;
then A28: n1 in ( dom g ) by A18,A27,A20,NAT_1:44;
then ( g . n1 ) in ( rng g ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A18,A25,A28,FUNCT_1:47;
end;
then k = ( rng g ) by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence g is  onto by FUNCT_2:def 3;
A29: ( ( dom f ) /\ n ) = ( dom ( f | n ) ) by RELAT_1:61;
n < ( n + 1 ) by NAT_1:13;
then A30: n c= ( n + 1 ) by NAT_1:39;
( dom f ) = ( n + 1 ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A31: n = ( ( dom f ) /\ n ) by A30,XBOOLE_1:28;
( 0 ) in n by A4,NAT_1:44;
then ( ( f | n ) . ( 0 ) ) in ( rng ( f | n ) ) by A31,A29,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then A32: (n = ( 0 ) iff k = ( 0 )) by A5;
(for i holds (for j holds (((i in ( rng g ) & j in ( rng g )) & i < j) implies ( min* ( g " { i } ) ) < ( min* ( g " { j } ) )))) by A1,A18,CKB46:1;
hence g is  "increasing by A32,CKB19:def 1;
end;

end;
end;
hence thesis;
