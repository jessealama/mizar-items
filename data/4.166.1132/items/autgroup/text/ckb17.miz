definition
let G;
func InnAut G -> (FUNCTION_DOMAIN of (the carrier of G),(the carrier of G)) means 
:Def4: (for f being (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of G),(the carrier of G)) )) holds (f in it iff (ex a st (for x holds ( f . x ) = ( x |^ a )))));
existence
proof
set I = ( id (the carrier of G) );
set X = { f where f is (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of G),(the carrier of G)) )): (ex a st (for x holds ( f . x ) = ( x |^ a ))) };
A1: (ex a st (for x holds ( I . x ) = ( x |^ a )))
proof
take a = ( 1_ G );
let x;
A2: ( a " ) = ( 1_ G ) by GROUP_1:8;
thus ( I . x ) = x by FUNCT_1:18
.= ( x * a ) by GROUP_1:def 4
.= ( x |^ a ) by A2,GROUP_1:def 4;
end;
I is (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of G),(the carrier of G)) )) by FUNCT_2:8;
then A3: I in X by A1;
X is  functional
proof
let h being set;
assume h in X;
then (ex f being (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of G),(the carrier of G)) )) st (f = h & (ex a st (for x holds ( f . x ) = ( x |^ a )))));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider X as  functional non  empty set by A3;
X is (FUNCTION_DOMAIN of (the carrier of G),(the carrier of G))
proof
let h being (Element of X);
h in X;
then (ex f being (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of G),(the carrier of G)) )) st (f = h & (ex a st (for x holds ( f . x ) = ( x |^ a )))));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider X as (FUNCTION_DOMAIN of (the carrier of G),(the carrier of G));
take X;
let f being (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of G),(the carrier of G)) ));
hereby
assume f in X;
then (ex f1 being (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of G),(the carrier of G)) )) st (f1 = f & (ex a st (for x holds ( f1 . x ) = ( x |^ a )))));
hence (ex a st (for x holds ( f . x ) = ( x |^ a )));
end;
thus thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let F1 being (FUNCTION_DOMAIN of (the carrier of G),(the carrier of G));
let F2 being (FUNCTION_DOMAIN of (the carrier of G),(the carrier of G));
assume that
A4: (for f being (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of G),(the carrier of G)) )) holds (f in F1 iff (ex a st (for x holds ( f . x ) = ( x |^ a )))))
and
A5: (for f being (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of G),(the carrier of G)) )) holds (f in F2 iff (ex a st (for x holds ( f . x ) = ( x |^ a )))));
A6: F2 c= F1
proof
let q;
assume A7: q in F2;
then q is (Function of (the carrier of G),(the carrier of G)) by FUNCT_2:def 12;
then reconsider b1 = q as (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of G),(the carrier of G)) )) by FUNCT_2:9;
(ex a st (for x holds ( b1 . x ) = ( x |^ a ))) by A5,A7;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
F1 c= F2
proof
let q;
assume A8: q in F1;
then q is (Function of (the carrier of G),(the carrier of G)) by FUNCT_2:def 12;
then reconsider b1 = q as (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of G),(the carrier of G)) )) by FUNCT_2:9;
(ex a st (for x holds ( b1 . x ) = ( x |^ a ))) by A4,A8;
hence thesis by A5;
end;
hence thesis by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
