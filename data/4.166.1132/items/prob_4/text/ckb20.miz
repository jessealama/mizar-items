theorem
Th15: (for X being non  empty set holds (for S being (SigmaField of X) holds (for M being (sigma_Measure of S) holds (( M . X ) = ( R_EAL 1 ) implies M is (Probability of S)))))
proof
let X being non  empty set;
let S being (SigmaField of X);
let M being (sigma_Measure of S);
assume that
A1: ( M . X ) = ( R_EAL 1 );
A2: (for A being (Element of S) holds ( M . A ) <= ( R_EAL 1 ))
proof
reconsider X as (Element of S) by PROB_1:5;
let A being (Element of S);
( M . A ) <= ( M . X ) by MEASURE1:31;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
A3: (for x holds (x in S implies ( M . x ) in ( REAL )))
proof
let x;
assume x in S;
then reconsider x as (Element of S);

(( 0. ) <= ( M . x ) & ( M . x ) <= ( R_EAL 1 )) by A2,MEASURE1:def 2;
hence thesis by A4,XXREAL_0:45;
end;

then reconsider P1 = M as (Function of S,( REAL )) by A3,FUNCT_2:3;
reconsider P1 as (Function of S,( REAL ));
A5: (for ASeq being (SetSequence of S) holds (ASeq is  non-ascending implies (( P1 * ASeq ) is  convergent & ( lim ( P1 * ASeq ) ) = ( P1 . ( Intersection ASeq ) ))))
proof
let ASeq being (SetSequence of S);
assume that
A6: ASeq is  non-ascending;
(for n holds ( 0 ) <= ( ( P1 * ASeq ) . n ))
proof
let n;
reconsider A = ( ASeq . n ) as (Event of S);
(( 0 ) <= ( P1 . A ) & ( dom ( P1 * ASeq ) ) = ( NAT )) by MEASURE1:def 2,SEQ_1:1;
hence thesis by FUNCT_1:12;
end;
then A7: ( P1 * ASeq ) is  bounded_below by RINFSUP1:10;
reconsider F = ASeq as (Function of ( NAT ),S) by CKB4:1;
A8: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( F . ( n + 1 ) ) c= ( F . n )) by A6,PROB_2:6;
A9: ( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) ) < ( +infty ) by A3,XXREAL_0:9;
now
let n;
( dom ( M * F ) ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A10: (( ( M * F ) . n ) = ( M . ( F . n ) ) & ( ( M * F ) . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( M . ( F . ( n + 1 ) ) )) by FUNCT_1:12;
( F . ( n + 1 ) ) c= ( F . n ) by A6,PROB_2:6;
hence ( ( P1 * ASeq ) . ( n + 1 ) ) <= ( ( P1 * ASeq ) . n ) by A10,MEASURE1:31;
end;
then A11: ( P1 * ASeq ) is  non-increasing by SEQM_3:def 9;
then ( lim ( P1 * ASeq ) ) = ( lower_bound ( P1 * ASeq ) ) by A7,RINFSUP1:25

hence thesis by A7,A11;
end;
A12: (for A,B being (Event of S) holds (A misses B implies ( P1 . ( A \/ B ) ) = ( ( P1 . A ) + ( P1 . B ) )))
proof
let A being (Event of S);
let B being (Event of S);
assume that
A13: A misses B;
reconsider A,B as (Element of S);
reconsider A2 = A,B2 = B as (Element of S);
( P1 . ( A \/ B ) ) = ( ( M . A2 ) + ( M . B2 ) ) by A13,MEASURE1:30
.= ( ( P1 . A ) + ( P1 . B ) ) by SUPINF_2:1;
hence thesis;
end;
((for A being (Event of S) holds ( 0 ) <= ( P1 . A )) & ( P1 . X ) = 1) by A1,MEASURE1:def 2,MEASURE6:def 1;
