definition
let Omega;
let Sigma;
let P;
func COM (Sigma,P) -> non  empty (Subset-Family of Omega) means 
:Def5: (for A being set holds (A in it iff (ex B being set st (B in Sigma & (ex C being (thin of P) st A = ( B \/ C ))))));
existence
proof
A1: ( {} ) is (thin of P) by CKB34:1;
A2: (for A being set holds (A = ( {} ) implies (ex B being set st (B in Sigma & (ex C being (thin of P) st A = ( B \/ C ))))))
proof
let A being set;
consider B being set such that A3: B = ( {} ) and A4: B in Sigma by PROB_1:4;
consider C being (thin of P) such that A5: C = ( {} ) by A1;
assume A = ( {} );
then A = ( B \/ C ) by A3,A5;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(for A being set holds (A = $1 implies (ex B being set st (B in Sigma & (ex C being (thin of P) st A = ( B \/ C ))))));
consider D being set such that A6: (for y being set holds (y in D iff (y in ( bool Omega ) & P[ y ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
A7: (for A being set holds (A in D iff (ex B being set st (B in Sigma & (ex C being (thin of P) st A = ( B \/ C ))))))
proof
let A being set;
A8: (A in D iff (A in ( bool Omega ) & (for y being set holds (y = A implies (ex B being set st (B in Sigma & (ex C being (thin of P) st y = ( B \/ C )))))))) by A6;
((ex B being set st (B in Sigma & (ex C being (thin of P) st A = ( B \/ C )))) implies A in D)
proof
assume A9: (ex B being set st (B in Sigma & (ex C being (thin of P) st A = ( B \/ C ))));
then A c= Omega by XBOOLE_1:8;
hence thesis by A8,A9;
end;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
A10: D c= ( bool Omega )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in D;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
( {} ) c= Omega by XBOOLE_1:2;
then reconsider D as non  empty (Subset-Family of Omega) by A6,A10,A2;
take D;
thus thesis by A7;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let D1 being non  empty (Subset-Family of Omega);
let D2 being non  empty (Subset-Family of Omega);
assume that
A11: (for A being set holds (A in D1 iff (ex B being set st (B in Sigma & (ex C being (thin of P) st A = ( B \/ C ))))))
and
A12: (for A being set holds (A in D2 iff (ex B being set st (B in Sigma & (ex C being (thin of P) st A = ( B \/ C ))))));
(for A being set holds (A in D1 iff A in D2))
proof
let A being set;
thus (A in D1 implies A in D2)
proof
assume A in D1;
then (ex B being set st (B in Sigma & (ex C being (thin of P) st A = ( B \/ C )))) by A11;
hence thesis by A12;
end;

assume A in D2;
then (ex B being set st (B in Sigma & (ex C being (thin of P) st A = ( B \/ C )))) by A12;
hence thesis by A11;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
end;
