definition
let Omega;
let Sigma;
let P;
let A being (Element of ( COM (Sigma,P) ));
func ProbPart A -> non empty (Subset-Family of Omega)
means
:Def7: (for B being set holds (B in it iff ((B in Sigma & B c= A) & ( A \ B ) is (thin of P))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(for t being set holds (t = $1 implies ((t in Sigma & t c= A) & ( A \ t ) is (thin of P))));
consider D being set such that A1: (for t being set holds (t in D iff (t in ( bool Omega ) & P[ t ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
A2: (for B being set holds (B in D iff ((B in Sigma & B c= A) & ( A \ B ) is (thin of P))))
proof
let B being set;
(((B in Sigma & B c= A) & ( A \ B ) is (thin of P)) implies B in D)
proof
assume that
A3: B in Sigma
and
A4: (B c= A & ( A \ B ) is (thin of P));
(for t being set holds (t = B implies ((t in Sigma & t c= A) & ( A \ t ) is (thin of P)))) by A3,A4;
hence thesis by A1,A3;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
A5: D c= ( bool Omega )
proof
let B being set;
assume B in D;
then B in Sigma by A2;
hence thesis;
end;
D <> ( {} )
proof
consider B being set such that A6: B in Sigma and A7: (ex C being (thin of P) st A = ( B \/ C )) by CKB36:def 1;
consider C being (thin of P) such that A8: A = ( B \/ C ) by A7;
consider E being set such that A9: E in Sigma and A10: C c= E and A11: ( P . E ) = ( 0 ) by CKB32:def 1;
( A \ B ) = ( C \ B ) by A8,XBOOLE_1:40;
then ( A \ B ) c= C by XBOOLE_1:36;
then ( A \ B ) c= E by A10,XBOOLE_1:1;
then A12: ( A \ B ) is (thin of P) by A9,A11,CKB32:def 1;
B c= A by A8,XBOOLE_1:7;
hence thesis by A2,A6,A12;
end;
then reconsider D as non empty (Subset-Family of Omega) by A5;
take D;
thus thesis by A2;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let D1 being non empty (Subset-Family of Omega),D2 being non empty (Subset-Family of Omega);
assume that
A13: (for B being set holds (B in D1 iff ((B in Sigma & B c= A) & ( A \ B ) is (thin of P))))
and
A14: (for B being set holds (B in D2 iff ((B in Sigma & B c= A) & ( A \ B ) is (thin of P))));
(for B being set holds (B in D1 iff B in D2))
proof
let B being set;
thus (B in D1 implies B in D2)
proof
assume A15: B in D1;
then A16: ( A \ B ) is (thin of P) by A13;
(B in Sigma & B c= A) by A13,A15;
hence thesis by A14,A16;
end;

assume A17: B in D2;
then A18: ( A \ B ) is (thin of P) by A14;
(B in Sigma & B c= A) by A14,A17;
hence thesis by A13,A18;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
