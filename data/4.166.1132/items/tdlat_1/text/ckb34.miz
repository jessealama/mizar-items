let T being TopSpace;
func Domains_Meet T -> (BinOp of ( Domains_of T ))
means
:Def3: (for A,B being (Element of ( Domains_of T )) holds ( it . (A,B) ) = ( ( Cl ( Int ( A /\ B ) ) ) /\ ( A /\ B ) ));
existence
proof
defpred X[ set,set ]
 means
(for A,B being (Element of ( Domains_of T )) holds ($1 = [ A,B ] implies $2 = ( ( Cl ( Int ( A /\ B ) ) ) /\ ( A /\ B ) )));
set D = [: ( Domains_of T ),(( Domains_of T ) qua non empty set) :];
A1: (for a being (Element of D) holds (ex b being (Element of ( Domains_of T )) st X[ a,b ]))
proof
let a being (Element of D);
reconsider G = ( a `1 ),F = ( a `2 ) as (Element of ( Domains_of T ));
F in { H where H is (Subset of T): H is  condensed };
then A2: (ex H being (Subset of T) st (H = F & H is  condensed));
G in { E where E is (Subset of T): E is  condensed };
then (ex E being (Subset of T) st (E = G & E is  condensed));
then ( ( Cl ( Int ( G /\ F ) ) ) /\ ( G /\ F ) ) is  condensed by A2,CKB17:1;
then ( ( Cl ( Int ( G /\ F ) ) ) /\ ( G /\ F ) ) in { E where E is (Subset of T): E is  condensed };
then reconsider b = ( ( Cl ( Int ( G /\ F ) ) ) /\ ( G /\ F ) ) as (Element of ( Domains_of T ));
take b;
let A being (Element of ( Domains_of T )),B being (Element of ( Domains_of T ));
assume a = [ A,B ];
then A3: [ A,B ] = [ G,F ] by MCART_1:21;
then A4: B = F by ZFMISC_1:27;
A = G by A3,ZFMISC_1:27;
hence thesis by A4;

consider h being (Function of D,( Domains_of T )) such that A5: (for a being (Element of D) holds X[ a,( h . a ) ]) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A1);
take h;
let A being (Element of ( Domains_of T )),B being (Element of ( Domains_of T ));
thus ( h . (A,B) ) = ( h . [ A,B ] )
.= ( ( Cl ( Int ( A /\ B ) ) ) /\ ( A /\ B ) ) by A5;
end;
uniqueness
proof
deffunc U((Element of ( Domains_of T )),(Element of ( Domains_of T ))) = ( ( Cl ( Int ( $1 /\ $2 ) ) ) /\ ( $1 /\ $2 ) );
thus (for o1,o2 being (BinOp of ( Domains_of T )) holds (((for a,b being (Element of ( Domains_of T )) holds ( o1 . (a,b) ) = U(a,b)) & (for a,b being (Element of ( Domains_of T )) holds ( o2 . (a,b) ) = U(a,b))) implies o1 = o2)) from BINOP_2:sch 2;
