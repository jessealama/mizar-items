theorem
Th16: (for C being FormalContext holds (for O1,O2 being (Subset of (the carrier of C)) holds ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . ( O1 \/ O2 ) ) = ( ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O1 ) /\ ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O2 ) )))
proof
let C being FormalContext;
let O1 being (Subset of (the carrier of C)),O2 being (Subset of (the carrier of C));
reconsider O9 = ( O1 \/ O2 ) as (Subset of (the carrier of C));
A1: (for x being set holds (x in ( ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O1 ) /\ ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O2 ) ) implies x in ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O9 )))
proof
let x being set;
assume A2: x in ( ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O1 ) /\ ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O2 ) );
then x in ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O1 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then x in { a where a is (Attribute of C): (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O1 implies o is-connected-with a)) } by CKB17:def 1;

then x in { a where a is (Attribute of C): (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O2 implies o is-connected-with a)) } by CKB17:def 1;
then A4: (ex x2 being (Attribute of C) st (x2 = x & (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O2 implies o is-connected-with x2))));
then reconsider x as (Attribute of C);
(for o being (Object of C) holds (o in ( O1 \/ O2 ) implies o is-connected-with x))
proof
let o being (Object of C);
assume A5: o in ( O1 \/ O2 );
now
per cases  by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
case o in O1;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
case o in O2;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
then x in { a where a is (Attribute of C): (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O9 implies o is-connected-with a)) };
hence thesis by CKB17:def 1;

proof
let o being (Object of C);

then A7: x in ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O2 ) by CKB17:def 1;
(for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O1 implies o is-connected-with x))
proof
let o being (Object of C);
