theorem
Th13: (for P,R being non  empty Poset holds (for Con being (Connection of P,R) holds (for f being (Function of P,R) holds (for g being (Function of R,P) holds (Con = [ f,g ] implies (Con is  co-Galois iff (for p being (Element of P) holds (for r being (Element of R) holds (p <= ( g . r ) iff r <= ( f . p ))))))))))
proof
let P being non  empty Poset;
let R being non  empty Poset;
let Con being (Connection of P,R);
let f being (Function of P,R);
let g being (Function of R,P);
assume A1: Con = [ f,g ];
A2:now
assume A3: (for p being (Element of P) holds (for r being (Element of R) holds (p <= ( g . r ) iff r <= ( f . p ))));
(for p1,p2 being (Element of P) holds (p1 <= p2 implies (for r1,r2 being (Element of R) holds ((r1 = ( f . p1 ) & r2 = ( f . p2 )) implies r1 >= r2))))
proof
let p1 being (Element of P);
let p2 being (Element of P);
assume A4: p1 <= p2;
let r1 being (Element of R);
let r2 being (Element of R);
assume A5: (r1 = ( f . p1 ) & r2 = ( f . p2 ));
p2 <= ( g . ( f . p2 ) ) by A3;
then p1 <= ( g . ( f . p2 ) ) by A4,ORDERS_2:3;
hence thesis by A3,A5;
end;
then A6: f is  antitone by WAYBEL_0:def 5;
(for r1,r2 being (Element of R) holds (r1 <= r2 implies (for p1,p2 being (Element of P) holds ((p1 = ( g . r1 ) & p2 = ( g . r2 )) implies p1 >= p2))))
proof
let r1 being (Element of R);
let r2 being (Element of R);
assume A7: r1 <= r2;
let p1 being (Element of P);
let p2 being (Element of P);
assume A8: (p1 = ( g . r1 ) & p2 = ( g . r2 ));
r2 <= ( f . ( g . r2 ) ) by A3;
then r1 <= ( f . ( g . r2 ) ) by A7,ORDERS_2:3;
hence thesis by A3,A8;
end;
then A9: g is  antitone by WAYBEL_0:def 5;
(for p1,p2 being (Element of P) holds (for r1,r2 being (Element of R) holds (p1 <= ( g . ( f . p1 ) ) & r1 <= ( f . ( g . r1 ) )))) by A3;
hence Con is  co-Galois by A1,A6,A9,CKB32:def 1;
end;
now
assume Con is  co-Galois;
then consider f9 being (Function of P,R),g9 being (Function of R,P) such that A10: Con = [ f9,g9 ] and A11: f9 is  antitone and A12: g9 is  antitone and A13: (for p1,p2 being (Element of P) holds (for r1,r2 being (Element of R) holds (p1 <= ( g9 . ( f9 . p1 ) ) & r1 <= ( f9 . ( g9 . r1 ) )))) by CKB32:def 1;
A14: g = ( Con `2 ) by A1,MCART_1:def 2
.= g9 by A10,MCART_1:def 2;
A15: f = ( Con `1 ) by A1,MCART_1:def 1
.= f9 by A10,MCART_1:def 1;
A16: (for p being (Element of P) holds (for r being (Element of R) holds (r <= ( f . p ) implies p <= ( g . r ))))
proof
let p being (Element of P);
let r being (Element of R);
assume r <= ( f . p );
then A17: ( g . r ) >= ( g . ( f . p ) ) by A12,A14,WAYBEL_0:def 5;
p <= ( g . ( f . p ) ) by A13,A15,A14;
hence thesis by A17,ORDERS_2:3;
end;
(for p being (Element of P) holds (for r being (Element of R) holds (p <= ( g . r ) implies r <= ( f . p ))))
proof
let p being (Element of P);
let r being (Element of R);
assume p <= ( g . r );
then A18: ( f . p ) >= ( f . ( g . r ) ) by A11,A15,WAYBEL_0:def 5;
r <= ( f . ( g . r ) ) by A13,A15,A14;
hence thesis by A18,ORDERS_2:3;
end;
hence (for p being (Element of P) holds (for r being (Element of R) holds (p <= ( g . r ) iff r <= ( f . p )))) by A16;
end;
hence thesis by A2;
