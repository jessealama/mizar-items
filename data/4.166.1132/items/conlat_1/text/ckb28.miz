theorem
Th10: (for C being FormalContext holds (for O being (Subset of (the carrier of C)) holds (for A being (Subset of (the carrier' of C)) holds (A c= ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O ) iff [: O,A :] c= (the Information of C)))))
proof
let C being FormalContext;
let O being (Subset of (the carrier of C));
let A being (Subset of (the carrier' of C));
A1: ([: O,A :] c= (the Information of C) implies A c= ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O ))
proof
assume A2: [: O,A :] c= (the Information of C);
let x being set;
assume A3: x in A;
then reconsider x as (Attribute of C);
(for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with x))
proof
let o being (Object of C);
consider z being set such that A4: z = [ o,x ];
assume o in O;
then z in [: O,A :] by A3,A4,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
hence thesis by A2,A4,CKB15:def 1;
end;
then x in { a where a is (Attribute of C): (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with a)) };
hence thesis by CKB17:def 1;
end;
(A c= ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O ) implies [: O,A :] c= (the Information of C))
proof
assume A c= ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O );
then A5: A c= { a where a is (Attribute of C): (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with a)) } by CKB17:def 1;
let z being set;
assume z in [: O,A :];
then consider x,y being set such that A6: x in O and A7: y in A and A8: z = [ x,y ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider y as (Attribute of C) by A7;
reconsider x as (Object of C) by A6;
y in { a where a is (Attribute of C): (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with a)) } by A5,A7;
then (ex y9 being (Attribute of C) st (y9 = y & (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with y9))));
then x is-connected-with y by A6;
hence thesis by A8,CKB15:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
