theorem
Th17: (for C being FormalContext holds (for A1,A2 being (Subset of (the carrier' of C)) holds ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . ( A1 \/ A2 ) ) = ( ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A1 ) /\ ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A2 ) )))
proof
let C being FormalContext;
let A1 being (Subset of (the carrier' of C));
let A2 being (Subset of (the carrier' of C));
reconsider A9 = ( A1 \/ A2 ) as (Subset of (the carrier' of C));
A1: (for x being set holds (x in ( ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A1 ) /\ ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A2 ) ) implies x in ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A9 )))
proof
let x being set;
assume A2: x in ( ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A1 ) /\ ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A2 ) );
then x in ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A1 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then x in { o where o is (Object of C): (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A1 implies o is-connected-with a)) } by CKB18:def 1;

then x in { o where o is (Object of C): (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A2 implies o is-connected-with a)) } by CKB18:def 1;
then A4: (ex x2 being (Object of C) st (x2 = x & (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A2 implies x2 is-connected-with a))));
then reconsider x as (Object of C);
(for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in ( A1 \/ A2 ) implies x is-connected-with a))
proof
let a being (Attribute of C);
assume A5: a in ( A1 \/ A2 );
now
per cases  by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
case a in A1;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
case a in A2;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
then x in { o where o is (Object of C): (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A9 implies o is-connected-with a)) };
hence thesis by CKB18:def 1;

then x in { o where o is (Object of C): (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A9 implies o is-connected-with a)) } by CKB18:def 1;
then A6: (ex x9 being (Object of C) st (x9 = x & (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A9 implies x9 is-connected-with a))));
then reconsider x as (Object of C);
(for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A2 implies x is-connected-with a))
proof
let a being (Attribute of C);
assume a in A2;
then a in A9 by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
then x in { o where o is (Object of C): (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A2 implies o is-connected-with a)) };
then A7: x in ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A2 ) by CKB18:def 1;
(for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A1 implies x is-connected-with a))
proof
let a being (Attribute of C);
assume a in A1;
then a in A9 by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
then x in { o where o is (Object of C): (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A1 implies o is-connected-with a)) };
then x in ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A1 ) by CKB18:def 1;
hence thesis by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
