theorem
Th7: (for C being FormalContext holds (for O being (Subset of (the carrier of C)) holds ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O ) = ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O ) ) )))
proof
let C being FormalContext;
let O being (Subset of (the carrier of C));
set A = { a where a is (Attribute of C): (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with a)) };
set O9 = { o where o is (Object of C): (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A implies o is-connected-with a)) };
set A9 = { a where a is (Attribute of C): (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O9 implies o is-connected-with a)) };
A1: (for x being set holds (x in A9 implies x in A))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in A9;
then A2: (ex x9 being (Attribute of C) st (x9 = x & (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O9 implies o is-connected-with x9))));
then reconsider x as (Attribute of C);
(for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with x))
proof
let o being (Object of C);
assume A3: o in O;
now
per cases ;
case o in O9;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
case (not o in O9);
then consider a being (Attribute of C) such that A4: a in A and A5: (not o is-connected-with a);
(ex a9 being (Attribute of C) st (a9 = a & (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with a9)))) by A4;
hence thesis by A3,A5;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
(for x being set holds (x in A implies x in A9))
proof
let x being set;
assume A6: x in A;
then (ex x9 being (Attribute of C) st (x9 = x & (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with x9))));
then reconsider x as (Attribute of C);
(for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O9 implies o is-connected-with x))
proof
let o being (Object of C);
assume o in O9;
then (ex o9 being (Object of C) st (o9 = o & (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A implies o9 is-connected-with a))));
hence thesis by A6;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
then A7: A = A9 by A1,TARSKI:1;
A c= (the carrier' of C)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in A;
then (ex x9 being (Attribute of C) st (x9 = x & (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with x9))));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider A as (Subset of (the carrier' of C));
O9 c= (the carrier of C)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in O9;
then (ex x9 being (Object of C) st (x9 = x & (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A implies x9 is-connected-with a))));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider O9 as (Subset of (the carrier of C));
(A = ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O ) & O9 = ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A )) by CKB17:def 1,CKB18:def 1;
hence thesis by A7,CKB17:def 1;
