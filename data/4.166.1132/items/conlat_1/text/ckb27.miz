theorem
Th9: (for C being FormalContext holds (for O being (Subset of (the carrier of C)) holds (for A being (Subset of (the carrier' of C)) holds (O c= ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A ) iff [: O,A :] c= (the Information of C)))))
proof
let C being FormalContext;
let O being (Subset of (the carrier of C));
let A being (Subset of (the carrier' of C));
A1: ([: O,A :] c= (the Information of C) implies O c= ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A ))
proof
assume A2: [: O,A :] c= (the Information of C);
let x being set;
assume A3: x in O;
then reconsider x as (Object of C);
(for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A implies x is-connected-with a))
proof
let a being (Attribute of C);
consider z being set such that A4: z = [ x,a ];
assume a in A;
then z in [: O,A :] by A3,A4,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
hence thesis by A2,A4,CKB15:def 1;
end;
then x in { o where o is (Object of C): (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A implies o is-connected-with a)) };
hence thesis by CKB18:def 1;
end;
(O c= ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A ) implies [: O,A :] c= (the Information of C))
proof
assume O c= ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A );
then A5: O c= { o where o is (Object of C): (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A implies o is-connected-with a)) } by CKB18:def 1;
let z being set;
assume z in [: O,A :];
then consider x being set,y being set such that A6: x in O and A7: y in A and A8: z = [ x,y ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider y as (Attribute of C) by A7;
reconsider x as (Object of C) by A6;
x in { o where o is (Object of C): (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A implies o is-connected-with a)) } by A5,A6;
then (ex x9 being (Object of C) st (x9 = x & (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A implies x9 is-connected-with a))));
then x is-connected-with y by A7;
hence thesis by A8,CKB15:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
