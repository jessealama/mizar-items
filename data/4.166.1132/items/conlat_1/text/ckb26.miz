theorem
Th8: (for C being FormalContext holds (for A being (Subset of (the carrier' of C)) holds ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A ) = ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A ) ) )))
proof
let C being FormalContext;
let A being (Subset of (the carrier' of C));
set O = { o where o is (Object of C): (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A implies o is-connected-with a)) };
set A9 = { a where a is (Attribute of C): (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with a)) };
set O9 = { o where o is (Object of C): (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A9 implies o is-connected-with a)) };
A1: (for x being set holds (x in O9 implies x in O))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in O9;
then A2: (ex x9 being (Object of C) st (x9 = x & (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A9 implies x9 is-connected-with a))));
then reconsider x as (Object of C);
(for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A implies x is-connected-with a))
proof
let a being (Attribute of C);
assume A3: a in A;
now
per cases ;
case a in A9;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
case (not a in A9);
then consider o being (Object of C) such that A4: o in O and A5: (not o is-connected-with a);
(ex o9 being (Object of C) st (o9 = o & (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A implies o9 is-connected-with a)))) by A4;
hence thesis by A3,A5;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
(for x being set holds (x in O implies x in O9))
proof
let x being set;
assume A6: x in O;
then (ex x9 being (Object of C) st (x9 = x & (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A implies x9 is-connected-with a))));
then reconsider x as (Object of C);
(for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A9 implies x is-connected-with a))
proof
let a being (Attribute of C);
assume a in A9;
then (ex a9 being (Attribute of C) st (a9 = a & (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with a9))));
hence thesis by A6;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
then A7: O = O9 by A1,TARSKI:1;
O c= (the carrier of C)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in O;
then (ex x9 being (Object of C) st (x9 = x & (for a being (Attribute of C) holds (a in A implies x9 is-connected-with a))));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider O as (Subset of (the carrier of C));
A9 c= (the carrier' of C)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in A9;
then (ex x9 being (Attribute of C) st (x9 = x & (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with x9))));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider A9 as (Subset of (the carrier' of C));
(O = ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A ) & A9 = ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O )) by CKB17:def 1,CKB18:def 1;
hence thesis by A7,CKB18:def 1;
