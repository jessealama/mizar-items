theorem
(for C being FormalContext holds (for a being (Attribute of C) holds ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . { a } ) = { o where o is (Object of C): o is-connected-with a }))
proof
let C being FormalContext;
let a being (Attribute of C);
{ a } c= (the carrier' of C)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in { a };
then x = a by TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider t = { a } as (Subset of (the carrier' of C));
A1: (for x being set holds (x in { o where o is (Object of C): (for a9 being (Attribute of C) holds (a9 in t implies o is-connected-with a9)) } implies x in { o where o is (Object of C): o is-connected-with a }))
proof
set a9 = the (Element of t);
let x being set;
reconsider a9 as (Attribute of C) by TARSKI:def 1;
A2: a9 = a by TARSKI:def 1;
assume x in { o where o is (Object of C): (for a9 being (Attribute of C) holds (a9 in t implies o is-connected-with a9)) };

x is-connected-with a9 by A3;
