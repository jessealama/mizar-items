theorem
Th51: (I = ( Ker f ) implies (ex h being (BCI-homomorphism of ( X ./. RI ),X9) st (f = ( h * ( nat_hom RI ) ) & h is  one-to-one)))
proof
set J = ( X ./. RI );
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(for a being (Element of X) holds ($1 = ( Class (RI,a) ) implies $2 = ( f . a )));
A1: ( dom ( nat_hom RI ) ) = (the carrier of X) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
assume A2: I = ( Ker f );
A3: (for x being (Element of J) holds (ex y being (Element of X9) st P[ x,y ]))
proof
let x being (Element of J);
x in ( Class RI );
then consider y being set such that A4: y in (the carrier of X) and A5: x = ( Class (RI,y) ) by EQREL_1:def 3;
reconsider y as (Element of X) by A4;
reconsider t = ( f . y ) as (Element of X9);
take t;
let a being (Element of X);
assume x = ( Class (RI,a) );
then y in ( Class (RI,a) ) by A5,EQREL_1:23;
then A6: [ a,y ] in RI by EQREL_1:18;
then ( y \ a ) in ( Ker f ) by A2,BCIALG_2:def 12;
then (ex x2 being (Element of X) st (( y \ a ) = x2 & ( f . x2 ) = ( 0. X9 )));
then A7: ( ( f . y ) \ ( f . a ) ) = ( 0. X9 ) by CKB44:def 1;
( a \ y ) in ( Ker f ) by A2,A6,BCIALG_2:def 12;
then (ex x1 being (Element of X) st (( a \ y ) = x1 & ( f . x1 ) = ( 0. X9 )));
then ( ( f . a ) \ ( f . y ) ) = ( 0. X9 ) by CKB44:def 1;

end;

now

end;
then reconsider h as (BCI-homomorphism of ( X ./. RI ),X9) by CKB44:def 1;
A15: h is  one-to-one
proof

then ( f . ( a1 \ b1 ) ) = ( 0. X9 ) by CKB44:def 1;
then ( a1 \ b1 ) in ( Ker f );

A26:now

thus (x in ( dom f ) implies (x in ( dom ( nat_hom RI ) ) & ( ( nat_hom RI ) . x ) in ( dom h )))
proof

thus x in ( dom f ) by A25,A29;

now

then reconsider a = x as (Element of X);
