theorem
Th12: (for K being (Linear_Combination of W) holds (ex L being (Linear_Combination of V) st (( Carrier K ) = ( Carrier L ) & ( Sum K ) = ( Sum L ))))
proof
let K being (Linear_Combination of W);
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(($1 in W & $2 = ( K . $1 )) or ((not $1 in W) & $2 = ( 0. GF )));
reconsider K9 = K as (Function of (the carrier of W),(the carrier of GF));
A1: (the carrier of W) c= (the carrier of V) by VECTSP_4:def 2;
then reconsider C = ( Carrier K ) as  finite (Subset of V) by XBOOLE_1:1;
A2: (for x holds (x in (the carrier of V) implies (ex y st (y in (the carrier of GF) & P[ x,y ]))))
proof
let x;
assume x in (the carrier of V);
then reconsider x as (Vector of V);
per cases ;
suppose A3: x in W;

then reconsider x as (Vector of W) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
P[ x,( K . x ) ] by A3;
hence thesis;
end;
suppose (not x in W);

hence thesis;
end;
end;
(ex L being (Function of (the carrier of V),(the carrier of GF)) st (for x holds (x in (the carrier of V) implies P[ x,( L . x ) ]))) from FUNCT_2:sch 1(A2);
then consider L being (Function of (the carrier of V),(the carrier of GF)) such that A4: (for x holds (x in (the carrier of V) implies P[ x,( L . x ) ]));
A5:now
let v being (Vector of V);
assume (not v in C);
then (((P[ v,( K . v ) ] & (not v in C)) & v in (the carrier of W)) or P[ v,( 0. GF ) ]) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
then ((P[ v,( K . v ) ] & ( K . v ) = ( 0. GF )) or P[ v,( 0. GF ) ]) by VECTSP_6:2;
hence ( L . v ) = ( 0. GF ) by A4;
end;
L is (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of V),(the carrier of GF)) )) by FUNCT_2:8;
then reconsider L as (Linear_Combination of V) by A5,VECTSP_6:def 1;
reconsider L9 = ( L | (the carrier of W) ) as (Function of (the carrier of W),(the carrier of GF)) by A1,FUNCT_2:32;
take L;
now
let x being set;
assume that
A6: x in ( Carrier L )
and
A7: (not x in (the carrier of W));
consider v being (Vector of V) such that A8: x = v and A9: ( L . v ) <> ( 0. GF ) by A6,VECTSP_6:1;
P[ v,( 0. GF ) ] by A7,A8,STRUCT_0:def 5;
hence contradiction by A4,A9;
end;
then A10: ( Carrier L ) c= (the carrier of W) by TARSKI:def 3;
now
let x being set;
assume A11: x in (the carrier of W);
then P[ x,( L . x ) ] by A4,A1;
hence ( K9 . x ) = ( L9 . x ) by A11,FUNCT_1:49,STRUCT_0:def 5;
end;
then K9 = L9 by FUNCT_2:12;
hence thesis by A10,CKB9:1;
