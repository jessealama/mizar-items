theorem
Th23: (for A,B being  finite (Subset of V) holds ((( the VectSpStr of V ) = ( Lin A ) & B is  linearly-independent) implies (( card B ) <= ( card A ) & (ex C being  finite (Subset of V) st ((C c= A & ( card C ) = ( ( card A ) - ( card B ) )) & ( the VectSpStr of V ) = ( Lin ( B \/ C ) ))))))
proof
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
(for n being Nat holds (for A,B being  finite (Subset of V) holds ((((( card A ) = n & ( card B ) = $1) & ( the VectSpStr of V ) = ( Lin A )) & B is  linearly-independent) implies ($1 <= n & (ex C being  finite (Subset of V) st ((C c= A & ( card C ) = ( n - $1 )) & ( the VectSpStr of V ) = ( Lin ( B \/ C ) )))))));
A1: (for m being Nat holds (P[ m ] implies P[ ( m + 1 ) ]))
proof
let m being Nat;
assume that
A2: P[ m ];
let n being Nat;
let A being  finite (Subset of V),B being  finite (Subset of V);
assume that
A3: ( card A ) = n
and
A4: ( card B ) = ( m + 1 )
and
A5: ( the VectSpStr of V ) = ( Lin A )
and
A6: B is  linearly-independent;
consider v being set such that A7: v in B by A4,CARD_1:27,XBOOLE_0:def 1;
reconsider v as (Vector of V) by A7;
set Bv = ( B \ { v } );
A8: Bv is  linearly-independent by A6,VECTSP_7:1,XBOOLE_1:36;
{ v } is (Subset of B) by A7,SUBSET_1:41;
then A9: ( card ( B \ { v } ) ) = ( ( card B ) - ( card { v } ) ) by CARD_2:44
.= ( ( m + 1 ) - 1 ) by A4,CARD_1:30
.= m;
then consider C being  finite (Subset of V) such that A10: C c= A and A11: ( card C ) = ( n - m ) and A12: ( the VectSpStr of V ) = ( Lin ( Bv \/ C ) ) by A2,A3,A5,A8;
A13: (not v in ( Lin Bv )) by A6,A7,CKB17:1;
A14:now
assume m = n;
then consider C being  finite (Subset of V) such that C c= A and A15: ( card C ) = ( m - m ) and A16: ( the VectSpStr of V ) = ( Lin ( Bv \/ C ) ) by A2,A3,A5,A9,A8;
C = ( {} ) by A15;
then Bv is (Basis of V) by A8,A16,VECTSP_7:def 3;
hence contradiction by A13,CKB12:1;
end;
v in ( Lin ( Bv \/ C ) ) by A12,STRUCT_0:def 5;
then consider w being (Vector of V) such that A17: w in C and A18: w in ( Lin ( ( ( C \/ Bv ) \ { w } ) \/ { v } ) ) by A13,CKB21:1;
set Cw = ( C \ { w } );
( ( Bv \ { w } ) \/ { v } ) c= ( Bv \/ { v } ) by XBOOLE_1:9,XBOOLE_1:36;

.= ( Cw \/ ( ( Bv \ { w } ) \/ { v } ) ) by XBOOLE_1:4;
then ( Lin ( ( ( C \/ Bv ) \ { w } ) \/ { v } ) ) is (Subspace of ( Lin ( B \/ Cw ) )) by A19,VECTSP_7:13;
then A22: w in ( Lin ( B \/ Cw ) ) by A18,VECTSP_4:8;
A23: (Bv c= B & C = ( Cw \/ { w } )) by A17,CKB2:1,XBOOLE_1:36;
now
let x being set;
assume x in ( Bv \/ C );
then (x in Bv or x in C) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then ((x in B or x in Cw) or x in { w }) by A23,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then (x in ( B \/ Cw ) or x in { w }) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then (x in ( Lin ( B \/ Cw ) ) or x = w) by TARSKI:def 1,VECTSP_7:8;
hence x in (the carrier of ( Lin ( B \/ Cw ) )) by A22,STRUCT_0:def 5;
end;
then ( Bv \/ C ) c= (the carrier of ( Lin ( B \/ Cw ) )) by TARSKI:def 3;

then (the carrier of ( Lin ( B \/ Cw ) )) = (the carrier of V) by A12,A24,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then A25: ( the VectSpStr of V ) = ( Lin ( B \/ Cw ) ) by A12,VECTSP_4:29;
m <= n by A2,A3,A5,A9,A8;
then m < n by A14,XXREAL_0:1;
hence thesis by A21,A20,A25,NAT_1:13;
end;
A26: P[ ( 0 ) ]
proof
let n being Nat;
let A being  finite (Subset of V),B being  finite (Subset of V);
assume that
A27: ( card A ) = n
and
A28: ( card B ) = ( 0 )
and
A29: ( the VectSpStr of V ) = ( Lin A )
and
B is  linearly-independent;
B = ( {} ) by A28;
then A = ( B \/ A );
hence thesis by A27,A29;
end;
A30: (for m holds P[ m ]) from NAT_1:sch 2(A26,A1);
let A being  finite (Subset of V),B being  finite (Subset of V);
assume (( the VectSpStr of V ) = ( Lin A ) & B is  linearly-independent);
hence thesis by A30;
