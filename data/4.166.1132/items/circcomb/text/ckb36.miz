(for S1,S2,S3 being non  empty ManySortedSign holds (for A1 being  non-empty MSAlgebra over S1 holds (for A2 being  non-empty MSAlgebra over S2 holds (for A3 being  non-empty MSAlgebra over S3 holds ((((the Sorts of A1) tolerates (the Sorts of A2) & (the Sorts of A2) tolerates (the Sorts of A3)) & (the Sorts of A3) tolerates (the Sorts of A1)) implies ( ( A1 +* A2 ) +* A3 ) = ( A1 +* ( A2 +* A3 ) ))))))
