proof
let S1 being non  void  Circuit-like non  empty ManySortedSign;
let S2 being non  void  Circuit-like non  empty ManySortedSign;
let S being non  void  Circuit-like non  empty ManySortedSign;
assume that
A1: S = ( S1 +* S2 );
let A1 being  non-empty (Circuit of S1);
let A2 being  non-empty (Circuit of S2);
let A being  non-empty (Circuit of S);
assume that
A2: S1 tolerates S2
and
A3: (the Sorts of A1) tolerates (the Sorts of A2)
and
A4: (the Charact of A1) tolerates (the Charact of A2)
and
A5: A = ( A1 +* A2 );
let s being (State of A);
let v being (Vertex of S);
hereby
let s1 being (State of A1);
assume that
A6: s1 = ( s | (the carrier of S1) );
A7:now
assume v in ( InnerVertices S1 );
then reconsider v1 = v as (Element of ( InnerVertices S1 ));
A8: ( ( Following s1 ) . v1 ) = ( ( Den (( action_at v1 ),A1) ) . ( ( action_at v1 ) depends_on_in s1 ) ) by CIRCUIT2:def 5;
v1 in ( InnerVertices S ) by A1,A2,CKB28:1;
then A9: ( ( Following s ) . v ) = ( ( Den (( action_at v ),A) ) . ( ( action_at v ) depends_on_in s ) ) by CIRCUIT2:def 5;
A10: ( action_at v ) = ( action_at v1 ) by A1,A2,CKB28:1;
then ( Den (( action_at v1 ),A1) ) = ( Den (( action_at v ),A) ) by A1,A3,A4,A5,CKB41:1;
hence ( ( Following s ) . v ) = ( ( Following s1 ) . v ) by A1,A2,A6,A10,A9,A8,CKB43:1;
end;
now
assume that
A11: v in (the carrier of S1)
and
A12: v in ( InputVertices S );
reconsider v1 = v as (Vertex of S1) by A11;
v1 in ( InputVertices S1 ) by A1,A2,A12,CKB24:1;
then A13: ( ( Following s1 ) . v1 ) = ( s1 . v1 ) by CIRCUIT2:def 5;
A14: ( dom s1 ) = (the carrier of S1) by CIRCUIT1:3;
( ( Following s ) . v ) = ( s . v ) by A12,CIRCUIT2:def 5;
hence ( ( Following s ) . v ) = ( ( Following s1 ) . v ) by A6,A13,A14,FUNCT_1:47;
end;
hence ((v in ( InnerVertices S1 ) or (v in (the carrier of S1) & v in ( InputVertices S ))) implies ( ( Following s ) . v ) = ( ( Following s1 ) . v )) by A7;
end;
let s2 being (State of A2);
assume that
A15: s2 = ( s | (the carrier of S2) );
A16:now
assume v in ( InnerVertices S2 );
then reconsider v2 = v as (Element of ( InnerVertices S2 ));
A17: ( ( Following s2 ) . v2 ) = ( ( Den (( action_at v2 ),A2) ) . ( ( action_at v2 ) depends_on_in s2 ) ) by CIRCUIT2:def 5;
v2 in ( InnerVertices S ) by A1,CKB26:1;
then A18: ( ( Following s ) . v ) = ( ( Den (( action_at v ),A) ) . ( ( action_at v ) depends_on_in s ) ) by CIRCUIT2:def 5;
A19: ( action_at v ) = ( action_at v2 ) by A1,CKB26:1;
then ( Den (( action_at v2 ),A2) ) = ( Den (( action_at v ),A) ) by A1,A3,A5,CKB40:1;
hence ( ( Following s ) . v ) = ( ( Following s2 ) . v ) by A1,A15,A19,A18,A17,CKB42:1;
end;
now
assume that
A20: v in (the carrier of S2)
and
A21: v in ( InputVertices S );
reconsider v2 = v as (Vertex of S2) by A20;
v2 in ( InputVertices S2 ) by A1,A21,CKB23:1;
then A22: ( ( Following s2 ) . v2 ) = ( s2 . v2 ) by CIRCUIT2:def 5;
A23: ( dom s2 ) = (the carrier of S2) by CIRCUIT1:3;
( ( Following s ) . v ) = ( s . v ) by A21,CIRCUIT2:def 5;
hence ( ( Following s ) . v ) = ( ( Following s2 ) . v ) by A15,A22,A23,FUNCT_1:47;
end;
hence thesis by A16;
