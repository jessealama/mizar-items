theorem
(for X0 being  everywhere_dense  proper (SubSpace of X) holds (ex X1 being  dense  open  proper  strict (SubSpace of X) st (ex X2 being  boundary  closed  strict (SubSpace of X) st (X1,X2 constitute_a_decomposition  & X1 is (SubSpace of X0)))))
proof
let X0 being  everywhere_dense  proper (SubSpace of X);
reconsider D = (the carrier of X0) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
D is  everywhere_dense by CKB24:1;
then consider C,B being (Subset of X) such that A1: C is  open  dense and A2: B is  closed  boundary and A3: ( C \/ ( D /\ B ) ) = D and A4: C misses B and A5: ( C \/ B ) = (the carrier of X) by TOPS_3:50;
C <> ( {} ) by A1,TOPS_3:17;
then consider X1 being  dense  open  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) such that A6: C = (the carrier of X1) by A1,CKB40:1;
A7:now
assume C is non  proper;
then C = (the carrier of X) by SUBSET_1:def 6;
then (the carrier of X) c= D by A3,XBOOLE_1:7;
then D = (the carrier of X) by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then D is non  proper by SUBSET_1:def 6;
hence contradiction by TEX_2:8;
end;
then B is non  empty by A5,SUBSET_1:def 6;
then consider X2 being  boundary  closed  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) such that A8: B = (the carrier of X2) by A2,CKB118:1;
reconsider X1 as  dense  open  proper  strict (SubSpace of X) by A6,A7,TEX_2:8;
take X1;
take X2;
(for P,Q being (Subset of X) holds ((P = (the carrier of X1) & Q = (the carrier of X2)) implies P,Q constitute_a_decomposition )) by A4,A5,A6,A8,TSEP_2:def 1;
hence X1,X2 constitute_a_decomposition  by TSEP_2:def 2;
C c= D by A3,XBOOLE_1:7;
hence thesis by A6,TSEP_1:4;
end;
