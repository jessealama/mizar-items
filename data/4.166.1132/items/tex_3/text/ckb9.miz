begin
reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
theorem
(for X being non  trivial TopSpace holds (for D being non  empty  proper (Subset of X) holds (ex Y0 being  proper  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) st D = (the carrier of Y0))))
proof
let X being non  trivial TopSpace;
let D being non  empty  proper (Subset of X);
consider Y0 being  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) such that A1: D = (the carrier of Y0) by TSEP_1:10;
reconsider Y0 as  proper  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) by A1,TEX_2:8;
take Y0;
thus thesis by A1;
