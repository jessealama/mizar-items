begin
reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
reserve A for (Subset of X);
reserve B for (Subset of X);
theorem
(for X0 being  dense non  empty (SubSpace of X) holds (for A being (Subset of X) holds (for B being (Subset of X0) holds (A = B implies (B is  dense iff A is  dense)))))
proof
let X0 being  dense non  empty (SubSpace of X);
let A being (Subset of X);
let B being (Subset of X0);
assume A1: A = B;
reconsider C = (the carrier of X0) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
C is  dense by CKB12:1;
hence thesis by A1,TOPS_3:60;
