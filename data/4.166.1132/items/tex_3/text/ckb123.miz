reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;

theorem
(for X0 being  nowhere_dense non  empty (SubSpace of X) holds (X0 is  boundary  closed or (ex X1 being  everywhere_dense  proper  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) st (ex X2 being  boundary  closed  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) st (( X1 meet X2 ) = ( the TopStruct of X0 ) & ( X1 union X2 ) = ( the TopStruct of X ))))))
proof
let X0 being  nowhere_dense non  empty (SubSpace of X);
reconsider D = (the carrier of X0) as non  empty (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
A1: X is (SubSpace of X) by TSEP_1:2;
D is  nowhere_dense by CKB58:1;
then consider C,B being (Subset of X) such that A2: C is  closed  boundary and A3: B is  everywhere_dense and A4: ( C /\ B ) = D and A5: ( C \/ B ) = (the carrier of X) by TOPS_3:51;
B <> ( {} ) by A4;
then consider X1 being  everywhere_dense  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) such that A6: B = (the carrier of X1) by A3,CKB30:1;
assume A7: (X0 is non  boundary or X0 is non  closed);
now
assume B is non  proper;
then B = (the carrier of X) by SUBSET_1:def 6;
then D = C by A4,XBOOLE_1:28;
hence contradiction by A7,A2,TSEP_1:11;
end;
then reconsider X1 as  everywhere_dense  proper  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) by A6,TEX_2:8;
C <> ( {} ) by A4;
then consider X2 being  boundary  closed  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) such that A8: C = (the carrier of X2) by A2,CKB118:1;
take X1;
take X2;
C meets B by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then X1 meets X2 by A8,A6,TSEP_1:def 3;
then (the carrier of ( X1 meet X2 )) = D by A4,A8,A6,TSEP_1:def 4;
hence ( X1 meet X2 ) = ( the TopStruct of X0 ) by TSEP_1:5;
(the carrier of ( X1 union X2 )) = (the carrier of X) by A5,A8,A6,TSEP_1:def 2;
hence thesis by A1,TSEP_1:5;
end;
