begin
reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
reserve Y1 for non  empty (SubSpace of X);
reserve Y2 for non  empty (SubSpace of X);
theorem
Th8: (for X being non  trivial TopSpace holds (for Y1 being  proper non  empty (SubSpace of X) holds (ex Y2 being  proper  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) st Y1,Y2 constitute_a_decomposition )))
proof
let X being non  trivial TopSpace;
let Y1 being  proper non  empty (SubSpace of X);
reconsider A1 = (the carrier of Y1) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
A1 is  proper by TEX_2:8;
then consider Y2 being  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) such that A1: ( A1 ` ) = (the carrier of Y2) by TSEP_1:10;
A2: (for P,Q being (Subset of X) holds ((P = (the carrier of Y1) & Q = (the carrier of Y2)) implies P,Q constitute_a_decomposition )) by A1,TSEP_2:5;
then Y1,Y2 constitute_a_decomposition  by TSEP_2:def 2;
then reconsider Y2 as  proper  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) by CKB8:1;
take Y2;
thus thesis by A2,TSEP_2:def 2;
