let X being non  empty TopSpace;
cluster  dense  closed -> non  proper for (SubSpace of X);
coherence
proof
let X0 being (SubSpace of X);
reconsider A = (the carrier of X0) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
assume A1: X0 is  dense  closed;
then A is  closed by TSEP_1:11;
then A2: ( Cl A ) = A by PRE_TOPC:22;
A is  dense by A1,CKB12:1;
then ( Cl A ) = (the carrier of X) by TOPS_3:def 2;
then A is non  proper by A2,SUBSET_1:def 6;
hence thesis by TEX_2:8;
