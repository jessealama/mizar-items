theorem
(for X0 being (SubSpace of X) holds (X0 is  everywhere_dense iff (ex X1 being  dense  open  strict (SubSpace of X) st X1 is (SubSpace of X0))))
proof
let X0 being (SubSpace of X);
reconsider A = (the carrier of X0) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
thus (X0 is  everywhere_dense implies (ex X1 being  dense  open  strict (SubSpace of X) st X1 is (SubSpace of X0)))
proof
assume X0 is  everywhere_dense;
then A is  everywhere_dense by CKB23:def 1;
then consider C being (Subset of X) such that A1: C c= A and A2: C is  open and A3: C is  dense by TOPS_3:41;
C is non  empty by A3,TOPS_3:17;
then consider X1 being  dense  open  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) such that A4: C = (the carrier of X1) by A2,A3,CKB40:1;
take X1;
thus thesis by A1,A4,TSEP_1:4;
end;

given X1 being  dense  open  strict (SubSpace of X) such that
A5: X1 is (SubSpace of X0);

reconsider C = (the carrier of X1) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
now
take C;
thus ((C c= A & C is  open) & C is  dense) by A5,CKB11:def 1,TSEP_1:4,TSEP_1:16;
end;
then (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A = (the carrier of X0) implies A is  everywhere_dense)) by TOPS_3:41;
hence thesis by CKB23:def 1;
end;
