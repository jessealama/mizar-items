reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
reserve X1 for non  empty (SubSpace of X);
reserve X2 for non  empty (SubSpace of X);
theorem
Th31: (for X1,X2 being (SubSpace of X) holds (X1,X2 constitute_a_decomposition  implies (X1 is  dense iff X2 is  boundary)))
proof
let X1 being (SubSpace of X);
let X2 being (SubSpace of X);
reconsider A1 = (the carrier of X1),A2 = (the carrier of X2) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
assume A1: (for A1,A2 being (Subset of X) holds ((A1 = (the carrier of X1) & A2 = (the carrier of X2)) implies A1,A2 constitute_a_decomposition ));
thus (X1 is  dense implies X2 is  boundary)
proof
assume A2: (for A1 being (Subset of X) holds (A1 = (the carrier of X1) implies A1 is  dense));
now
let A2 being (Subset of X);
assume A2 = (the carrier of X2);
then A3: A1,A2 constitute_a_decomposition  by A1;
A1 is  dense by A2;
hence A2 is  boundary by A3,CKB4:1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB46:def 1;
end;

assume A4: (for A2 being (Subset of X) holds (A2 = (the carrier of X2) implies A2 is  boundary));
now
let A1 being (Subset of X);
assume A1 = (the carrier of X1);
then A5: A1,A2 constitute_a_decomposition  by A1;
A2 is  boundary by A4;
hence A1 is  dense by A5,CKB4:1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB11:def 1;
