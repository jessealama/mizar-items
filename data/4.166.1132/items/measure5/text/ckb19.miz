theorem
Th17: (for a,b being R_eal holds (a < b implies (ex x being R_eal st ((a < x & x < b) & x in ( REAL )))))
proof
let a being R_eal;
let b being R_eal;
A1: (a in ( REAL ) or a in { ( -infty ),( +infty ) }) by XBOOLE_0:def 3,XXREAL_0:def 4;
A2: (b in ( REAL ) or b in { ( -infty ),( +infty ) }) by XBOOLE_0:def 3,XXREAL_0:def 4;
assume A3: a < b;
then A4: ((not a = ( +infty )) & (not b = ( -infty ))) by XXREAL_0:4,XXREAL_0:6;
per cases  by A1,A2,A4,TARSKI:def 2;
suppose (a in ( REAL ) & b in ( REAL ));

then consider x,y being Real such that A5: (x = a & y = b) and x <= y by A3;
consider z being  real number such that A6: (x < z & z < y) by A3,A5,XREAL_1:5;
reconsider z as Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
reconsider o = z as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
take o;
thus thesis by A5,A6;
end;
suppose A7: (a in ( REAL ) & b = ( +infty ));

then reconsider x = a as Real;
consider z being  real number such that A8: x < z by XREAL_1:1;
reconsider z as Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
reconsider o = z as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
take o;
thus thesis by A7,A8,XXREAL_0:9;
end;
suppose A9: (a = ( -infty ) & b in ( REAL ));

then reconsider y = b as Real;
consider z being  real number such that A10: z < y by XREAL_1:2;
reconsider z as Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
reconsider o = z as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
take o;
thus thesis by A9,A10,XXREAL_0:12;
end;
suppose A11: (a = ( -infty ) & b = ( +infty ));

take ( 0. );
( 0. ) = ( 0 );
hence thesis by A11;
end;
end;
