scheme RSetEq { P[set] } : (for X1,X2 being (Subset of ( REAL )) holds (((for x being R_eal holds (x in X1 iff P[ x ])) & (for x being R_eal holds (x in X2 iff P[ x ]))) implies X1 = X2))
proof
let A1 being (Subset of ( REAL ));
let A2 being (Subset of ( REAL ));
assume that
A1: (for x being R_eal holds (x in A1 iff P[ x ]))
and
A2: (for x being R_eal holds (x in A2 iff P[ x ]));
thus A1 c= A2
proof
let x being  real number;
assume A3: x in A1;
then x in ( REAL );
then reconsider x as R_eal by NUMBERS:31;
P[ x ] by A1,A3;
hence thesis by A2;
end;

let x being  real number;
assume A4: x in A2;
then x in ( REAL );
then reconsider x as R_eal by NUMBERS:31;
P[ x ] by A2,A4;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
