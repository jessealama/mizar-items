theorem
Th15: (for f being (PartFunc of (the carrier of S),( REAL )) holds (f is_continuous_in x0 iff (x0 in ( dom f ) & (for r holds (( 0 ) < r implies (ex s st (( 0 ) < s & (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & ||. ( x1 - x0 ) .|| < s) implies ( abs ( ( f /. x1 ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) ) < r)))))))))
proof
let f being (PartFunc of (the carrier of S),( REAL ));
thus (f is_continuous_in x0 implies (x0 in ( dom f ) & (for r holds (( 0 ) < r implies (ex s st (( 0 ) < s & (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & ||. ( x1 - x0 ) .|| < s) implies ( abs ( ( f /. x1 ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) ) < r))))))))
proof
assume A1: f is_continuous_in x0;
hence x0 in ( dom f ) by CKB10:def 1;
given r such that
A2: ( 0 ) < r
and
A3: (for s holds ((not ( 0 ) < s) or (ex x1 st ((x1 in ( dom f ) & ||. ( x1 - x0 ) .|| < s) & (not ( abs ( ( f /. x1 ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) ) < r)))));

defpred P[ (Element of ( NAT )),(Point of S) ]
 means
(($2 in ( dom f ) & ||. ( $2 - x0 ) .|| < ( 1 / ( $1 + 1 ) )) & (not ( abs ( ( f /. $2 ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) ) < r));
A4: (for n holds (ex p being (Point of S) st P[ n,p ]))
proof
let n;
( 0 ) < ( n + 1 ) by NAT_1:3;
then ( 0 ) < ( ( n + 1 ) " ) by XREAL_1:122;
then ( 0 ) < ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ) by XCMPLX_1:215;
then consider p being (Point of S) such that A5: ((p in ( dom f ) & ||. ( p - x0 ) .|| < ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) )) & ( abs ( ( f /. p ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) ) >= r) by A3;
take p;
thus thesis by A5;
end;
consider s1 being (Function of ( NAT ),(the carrier of S)) such that A6: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ n,( s1 . n ) ]) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A4);
reconsider s1 as (sequence of S);
A7: ( rng s1 ) c= ( dom f )
proof
A8: ( dom s1 ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
let v being set;
assume v in ( rng s1 );
then (ex n being set st (n in ( NAT ) & v = ( s1 . n ))) by A8,FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
A9:now
let n;
( abs ( ( f /. ( s1 . n ) ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) ) >= r by A6;
hence ( abs ( ( ( f /* s1 ) . n ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) ) >= r by A7,FUNCT_2:109;
end;
A10:now
let s being Real;
consider n such that A11: ( s " ) < n by SEQ_4:3;
assume ( 0 ) < s;
then A12: ( 0 ) < ( s " ) by XREAL_1:122;
( ( s " ) + ( 0 ) ) < ( n + 1 ) by A11,XREAL_1:8;
then ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ) < ( 1 / ( s " ) ) by A12,XREAL_1:76;
then A13: ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ) < s by XCMPLX_1:216;
take k = n;
let m;
assume k <= m;
then ( k + 1 ) <= ( m + 1 ) by XREAL_1:6;
then ( 1 / ( m + 1 ) ) <= ( 1 / ( k + 1 ) ) by NAT_1:3,XREAL_1:118;
then ( 1 / ( m + 1 ) ) < s by A13,XXREAL_0:2;
hence ||. ( ( s1 . m ) - x0 ) .|| < s by A6,XXREAL_0:2;
end;
then A14: s1 is  convergent by NORMSP_1:def 6;
then ( lim s1 ) = x0 by A10,NORMSP_1:def 7;
then (( f /* s1 ) is  convergent & ( f /. x0 ) = ( lim ( f /* s1 ) )) by A1,A7,A14,CKB10:def 1;
then consider n such that A15: (for m holds (n <= m implies ( abs ( ( ( f /* s1 ) . m ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) ) < r)) by A2,SEQ_2:def 7;
( abs ( ( ( f /* s1 ) . n ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) ) < r by A15;
hence contradiction by A9;
end;

assume that
A16: x0 in ( dom f )
and
A17: (for r holds (( 0 ) < r implies (ex s st (( 0 ) < s & (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & ||. ( x1 - x0 ) .|| < s) implies ( abs ( ( f /. x1 ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) ) < r))))));
now
let s1;
assume that
A18: ( rng s1 ) c= ( dom f )
and
A19: (s1 is  convergent & ( lim s1 ) = x0);
A20:now
let p being  real number;
reconsider pp = p as Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
assume ( 0 ) < p;
then consider s such that A21: ( 0 ) < s and A22: (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & ||. ( x1 - x0 ) .|| < s) implies ( abs ( ( f /. x1 ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) ) < pp)) by A17;
consider n such that A23: (for m holds (n <= m implies ||. ( ( s1 . m ) - x0 ) .|| < s)) by A19,A21,NORMSP_1:def 7;
take k = n;
let m;
assume k <= m;
then A24: ||. ( ( s1 . m ) - x0 ) .|| < s by A23;
( dom s1 ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( s1 . m ) in ( rng s1 ) by FUNCT_1:3;
then ( abs ( ( f /. ( s1 . m ) ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) ) < p by A18,A22,A24;
hence ( abs ( ( ( f /* s1 ) . m ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) ) < p by A18,FUNCT_2:109;
end;
then ( f /* s1 ) is  convergent by SEQ_2:def 6;
hence (( f /* s1 ) is  convergent & ( f /. x0 ) = ( lim ( f /* s1 ) )) by A20,SEQ_2:def 7;
end;
hence thesis by A16,CKB10:def 1;
