theorem
Th17: (for f holds (for x0 holds (f is_continuous_in x0 iff (x0 in ( dom f ) & (for N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 )) holds (ex N being (Neighbourhood of x0) st ( f .: N ) c= N1))))))
proof
let f;
let x0;
thus (f is_continuous_in x0 implies (x0 in ( dom f ) & (for N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 )) holds (ex N being (Neighbourhood of x0) st ( f .: N ) c= N1))))
proof
assume A1: f is_continuous_in x0;
hence x0 in ( dom f ) by CKB9:def 1;
let N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 ));
consider N being (Neighbourhood of x0) such that A2: (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & x1 in N) implies ( f /. x1 ) in N1)) by A1,CKB15:1;
take N;
now
let r being set;
assume r in ( f .: N );
then consider x being (Point of S) such that A3: x in ( dom f ) and A4: x in N and A5: r = ( f . x ) by PARTFUN2:59;
r = ( f /. x ) by A3,A5,PARTFUN1:def 6;
hence r in N1 by A2,A3,A4;

assume that
A6: x0 in ( dom f )
and
A7: (for N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 )) holds (ex N being (Neighbourhood of x0) st ( f .: N ) c= N1));
now
let N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 ));
consider N being (Neighbourhood of x0) such that A8: ( f .: N ) c= N1 by A7;
take N;
let x1;
assume that
A9: x1 in ( dom f )
and
A10: x1 in N;
( f . x1 ) in ( f .: N ) by A9,A10,FUNCT_1:def 6;
then ( f . x1 ) in N1 by A8;
hence ( f /. x1 ) in N1 by A9,PARTFUN1:def 6;
end;
hence thesis by A6,CKB15:1;
