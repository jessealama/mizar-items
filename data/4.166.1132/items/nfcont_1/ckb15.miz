theorem
Th16: (for f holds (for x0 holds (f is_continuous_in x0 iff (x0 in ( dom f ) & (for N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 )) holds (ex N being (Neighbourhood of x0) st (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & x1 in N) implies ( f /. x1 ) in N1))))))))
proof
let f;
let x0;
thus (f is_continuous_in x0 implies (x0 in ( dom f ) & (for N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 )) holds (ex N being (Neighbourhood of x0) st (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & x1 in N) implies ( f /. x1 ) in N1))))))
proof
assume A1: f is_continuous_in x0;
hence x0 in ( dom f ) by CKB9:def 1;
let N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 ));
consider r such that A2: ( 0 ) < r and A3: { y where y is (Point of T): ||. ( y - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r } c= N1 by CKB3:def 1;
consider s such that A4: ( 0 ) < s and A5: (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & ||. ( x1 - x0 ) .|| < s) implies ||. ( ( f /. x1 ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r)) by A1,A2,CKB13:1;
reconsider N = { z where z is (Point of S): ||. ( z - x0 ) .|| < s } as (Neighbourhood of x0) by A4,CKB4:1;
take N;
let x1;
assume that
A6: x1 in ( dom f )
and
A7: x1 in N;
(ex z being (Point of S) st (x1 = z & ||. ( z - x0 ) .|| < s)) by A7;
then ||. ( ( f /. x1 ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r by A5,A6;
then ( f /. x1 ) in { y where y is (Point of T): ||. ( y - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r };
hence thesis by A3;
end;

assume that
A8: x0 in ( dom f )
and
A9: (for N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 )) holds (ex N being (Neighbourhood of x0) st (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & x1 in N) implies ( f /. x1 ) in N1))));
now
let r;
assume ( 0 ) < r;
then reconsider N1 = { y where y is (Point of T): ||. ( y - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r } as (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 )) by CKB4:1;
consider N2 being (Neighbourhood of x0) such that A10: (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & x1 in N2) implies ( f /. x1 ) in N1)) by A9;
consider s such that A11: ( 0 ) < s and A12: { z where z is (Point of S): ||. ( z - x0 ) .|| < s } c= N2 by CKB3:def 1;
take s;
(for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & ||. ( x1 - x0 ) .|| < s) implies ||. ( ( f /. x1 ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r))
proof
let x1;
assume that
A13: x1 in ( dom f )
and
A14: ||. ( x1 - x0 ) .|| < s;
x1 in { z where z is (Point of S): ||. ( z - x0 ) .|| < s } by A14;
then ( f /. x1 ) in N1 by A10,A12,A13;
then (ex y being (Point of T) st (( f /. x1 ) = y & ||. ( y - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r));
hence thesis;
end;
hence (( 0 ) < s & (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & ||. ( x1 - x0 ) .|| < s) implies ||. ( ( f /. x1 ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r))) by A11;
end;
hence thesis by A8,CKB13:1;
