theorem
(( (the Sorts of U0) . s ) <> ( {} ) implies ( Constants (U0,s) ) = { ( const (o,U0) ) where o is (Element of (the carrier' of S)): (( the_result_sort_of o ) = s & ( the_arity_of o ) = ( {} )) })
proof
assume A1: ( (the Sorts of U0) . s ) <> ( {} );
thus ( Constants (U0,s) ) c= { ( const (o,U0) ) where o is (Element of (the carrier' of S)): (( the_result_sort_of o ) = s & ( the_arity_of o ) = ( {} )) }
proof
