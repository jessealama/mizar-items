existence
proof
thus (ex PC being (MSAlgebra-Family of I,S) st (for i holds (i in I implies (ex Ji being non  empty set st (ex Cs being (MSAlgebra-Family of Ji,S) st ((Ji = ( J . i ) & Cs = ( C . i )) & ( PC . i ) = ( product Cs )))))))

let i being set;

then reconsider Ji = ( J . i ) as non  empty set;
reconsider Cs = ( C . i ) as (MSAlgebra-Family of Ji,S) by A2,CKB36:def 1;
(ex a being set st a = ( product Cs ));
then consider j being set such that A3: (ex Ji being non  empty set st (ex Cs being (MSAlgebra-Family of Ji,S) st ((Ji = ( J . i ) & Cs = ( C . i )) & j = ( product Cs ))));
take j;
thus P[ i,j ] by A3;

consider PC being (ManySortedSet of I) such that A4: (for i being set holds (i in I implies P[ i,( PC . i ) ])) from PBOOLE:sch 3(A1);
now
let i being set;
assume i in I;
then (ex Ji being non  empty set st (ex Cs being (MSAlgebra-Family of Ji,S) st ((Ji = ( J . i ) & Cs = ( C . i )) & ( PC . i ) = ( product Cs )))) by A4;
hence ( PC . i ) is  non-empty  non-empty MSAlgebra over S;
end;
then reconsider PC as (MSAlgebra-Family of I,S) by PRALG_2:def 5;
take PC;
thus thesis by A4;

now
let i1 being set;
