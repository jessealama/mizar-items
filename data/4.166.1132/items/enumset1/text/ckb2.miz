definition
let x1;
let x2;
let x3;
func {x1,x2,x3 } -> set means 
:Def1: (x in it iff ((x = x1 or x = x2) or x = x3));
existence
proof
take ( union { { x1,x2 },{ x3 } } );
let x;
(x in { x1,x2 } iff (x = x1 or x = x2)) by TARSKI:def 2;
hence thesis by CKB1:1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(($1 = x1 or $1 = x2) or $1 = x3);
(for X1,X2 being set holds (((for x being set holds (x in X1 iff P[ x ])) & (for x being set holds (x in X2 iff P[ x ]))) implies X1 = X2)) from XBOOLE_0:sch 3;
hence thesis;
