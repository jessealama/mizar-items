theorem
(for L1 being sup-Semilattice holds (for L2 being non empty RelStr holds (for X,Y being (Subset of L1) holds (for X1,Y1 being (Subset of L2) holds (((( the RelStr of L1 ) = ( the RelStr of L2 ) & X = X1) & Y = Y1) implies ( X "\/" Y ) = ( X1 "\/" Y1 ))))))
proof
let L1 being sup-Semilattice;
let L2 being non empty RelStr;
let X being (Subset of L1),Y being (Subset of L1);
let X1 being (Subset of L2),Y1 being (Subset of L2);
assume that
A1: ( the RelStr of L1 ) = ( the RelStr of L2 )
and
A2: (X = X1 & Y = Y1);
set XY = { ( x "\/" y ) where x is (Element of L1),y is (Element of L1): (x in X & y in Y) };
set XY1 = { ( x "\/" y ) where x is (Element of L2),y is (Element of L2): (x in X1 & y in Y1) };
A3: XY = XY1
proof
hereby
let a being set;
assume a in XY;
then consider x being (Element of L1),y being (Element of L1) such that A4: a = ( x "\/" y ) and A5: (x in X & y in Y);
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y as (Element of L2) by A1;
a = ( x1 "\/" y1 ) by A1,A4,CKB12:1;
hence a in XY1 by A2,A5;
end;
let a being set;
assume a in XY1;
then consider x being (Element of L2),y being (Element of L2) such that A6: a = ( x "\/" y ) and A7: (x in X1 & y in Y1);
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y as (Element of L1) by A1;
a = ( x1 "\/" y1 ) by A1,A6,CKB12:1;
hence thesis by A2,A7;
end;
thus ( X "\/" Y ) = XY by YELLOW_4:def 3
.= ( X1 "\/" Y1 ) by A3,YELLOW_4:def 3;
end;
