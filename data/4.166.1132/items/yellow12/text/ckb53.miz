theorem
(T is  Hausdorff iff (for A being (Subset of [: T,T :]) holds (A = ( id (the carrier of T) ) implies A is  closed)))
proof
reconsider f = ( pr1 ((the carrier of T),(the carrier of T)) ),g = ( pr2 ((the carrier of T),(the carrier of T)) ) as  continuous (Function of [: T,T :],T) by CKB46:1,CKB47:1;
reconsider A = ( id (the carrier of T) ) as (Subset of [: T,T :]) by BORSUK_1:def 2;
hereby
assume A1: T is  Hausdorff;
let A being (Subset of [: T,T :]);
assume A = ( id (the carrier of T) );
then A = { p where p is (Point of [: T,T :]): ( f . p ) = ( g . p ) } by CKB44:1;
hence A is  closed by A1,CKB52:1;
end;
assume (for A being (Subset of [: T,T :]) holds (A = ( id (the carrier of T) ) implies A is  closed));
then (( [#] [: T,T :] ) = [: ( [#] T ),( [#] T ) :] & A is  closed) by BORSUK_1:def 2;
then ( [: ( [#] T ),( [#] T ) :] \ A ) is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 3;
then consider SF being (Subset-Family of [: T,T :]) such that A2: ( [: ( [#] T ),( [#] T ) :] \ A ) = ( union SF ) and A3: (for e being set holds (e in SF implies (ex X1,Y1 being (Subset of T) st ((e = [: X1,Y1 :] & X1 is  open) & Y1 is  open)))) by BORSUK_1:5;
let p being (Point of T);
let q being (Point of T);
assume (not p = q);
then ((the carrier of [: T,T :]) = [: (the carrier of T),(the carrier of T) :] & (not [ p,q ] in ( id ( [#] T ) ))) by BORSUK_1:def 2,RELAT_1:def 10;
then [ p,q ] in ( [: ( [#] T ),( [#] T ) :] \ A ) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then consider XY being set such that A4: [ p,q ] in XY and A5: XY in SF by A2,TARSKI:def 4;
consider X1,Y1 being (Subset of T) such that A6: XY = [: X1,Y1 :] and A7: (X1 is  open & Y1 is  open) by A3,A5;
take X1;
take Y1;
thus (X1 is  open & Y1 is  open) by A7;
thus (p in X1 & q in Y1) by A4,A6,ZFMISC_1:87;
assume ( X1 /\ Y1 ) <> ( {} );
then consider w being set such that A8: w in ( X1 /\ Y1 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
(w in X1 & w in Y1) by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then [ w,w ] in XY by A6,ZFMISC_1:87;
then [ w,w ] in ( union SF ) by A5,TARSKI:def 4;
then (not [ w,w ] in A) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence contradiction by A8,RELAT_1:def 10;
