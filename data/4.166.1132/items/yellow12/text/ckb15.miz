theorem
Th13: (for L1 being  antisymmetric  up-complete non empty  reflexive RelStr holds (for L2 being non empty  reflexive RelStr holds (for x being (Element of L1) holds (for y being (Element of L2) holds ((( the RelStr of L1 ) = ( the RelStr of L2 ) & x = y) implies (( waybelow x ) = ( waybelow y ) & ( wayabove x ) = ( wayabove y )))))))
proof
let L1 being  antisymmetric  up-complete non empty  reflexive RelStr;
let L2 being non empty  reflexive RelStr;
let x being (Element of L1);
let y being (Element of L2);
assume that
A1: ( the RelStr of L1 ) = ( the RelStr of L2 )
and
A2: x = y;
hereby
hereby
let a being set;
assume a in ( waybelow x );
then consider z being (Element of L1) such that A3: a = z and A4: z << x;
reconsider w = z as (Element of L2) by A1;
L2 is  antisymmetric by A1,WAYBEL_8:14;
then w << y by A1,A2,A4,WAYBEL_8:8;
hence a in ( waybelow y ) by A3;
end;
let a being set;
assume a in ( waybelow y );
then consider z being (Element of L2) such that A5: a = z and A6: z << y;
reconsider w = z as (Element of L1) by A1;
L2 is  up-complete  antisymmetric by A1,WAYBEL_8:14,WAYBEL_8:15;
then w << x by A1,A2,A6,WAYBEL_8:8;
hence a in ( waybelow x ) by A5;
end;
hereby
let a being set;
assume a in ( wayabove x );
then consider z being (Element of L1) such that A7: a = z and A8: z >> x;
reconsider w = z as (Element of L2) by A1;
L2 is  antisymmetric by A1,WAYBEL_8:14;
then w >> y by A1,A2,A8,WAYBEL_8:8;
hence a in ( wayabove y ) by A7;
end;
let a being set;
assume a in ( wayabove y );
then consider z being (Element of L2) such that A9: a = z and A10: z >> y;
reconsider w = z as (Element of L1) by A1;
L2 is  up-complete  antisymmetric by A1,WAYBEL_8:14,WAYBEL_8:15;
then w >> x by A1,A2,A10,WAYBEL_8:8;
hence thesis by A9;
