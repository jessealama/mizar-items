theorem
Th45: (for T being  Hausdorff non  empty TopSpace holds (for f,g being  continuous (Function of S,T) holds ((for X being (Subset of S) holds (X = { p where p is (Point of S): ( f . p ) <> ( g . p ) } implies X is  open)) & (for X being (Subset of S) holds (X = { p where p is (Point of S): ( f . p ) = ( g . p ) } implies X is  closed)))))
proof
let T being  Hausdorff non  empty TopSpace;
let f being  continuous (Function of S,T);
let g being  continuous (Function of S,T);
{ p where p is (Point of S): ( f . p ) <> ( g . p ) } c= (the carrier of S)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in { p where p is (Point of S): ( f . p ) <> ( g . p ) };
then (ex a being (Point of S) st (x = a & ( f . a ) <> ( g . a )));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider A = { p where p is (Point of S): ( f . p ) <> ( g . p ) } as (Subset of S);
A1: ( [#] T ) <> ( {} );
thus (for X being (Subset of S) holds (X = { p where p is (Point of S): ( f . p ) <> ( g . p ) } implies X is  open))
proof
let X being (Subset of S);
assume that
A2: X = { p where p is (Point of S): ( f . p ) <> ( g . p ) };
(for x being set holds (x in X iff (ex Q being (Subset of S) st ((Q is  open & Q c= X) & x in Q))))
proof
let x being set;
hereby
assume x in X;
then consider p being (Point of S) such that A3: x = p and A4: ( f . p ) <> ( g . p ) by A2;
consider W,V being (Subset of T) such that A5: (W is  open & V is  open) and A6: ( f . p ) in W and A7: ( g . p ) in V and A8: W misses V by A4,PRE_TOPC:def 10;
( dom g ) = (the carrier of S) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then [ x,( g . p ) ] in g by A3,FUNCT_1:def 2;
then A9: x in ( g " V ) by A7,RELAT_1:def 14;
take Q = ( ( f " W ) /\ ( g " V ) );
(( f " W ) is  open & ( g " V ) is  open) by A1,A5,TOPS_2:43;
hence Q is  open;
thus Q c= X
proof
let q being set;
assume A10: q in Q;
then q in ( f " W ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider yf being set such that A11: [ q,yf ] in f and A12: yf in W by RELAT_1:def 14;
q in ( g " V ) by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider yg being set such that A13: ([ q,yg ] in g & yg in V) by RELAT_1:def 14;
A14: (yg = ( g . q ) & (not yg in W)) by A8,A13,FUNCT_1:1,XBOOLE_0:3;
yf = ( f . q ) by A11,FUNCT_1:1;
hence thesis by A2,A10,A12,A14;
end;

( dom f ) = (the carrier of S) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then [ x,( f . p ) ] in f by A3,FUNCT_1:def 2;
then x in ( f " W ) by A6,RELAT_1:def 14;
hence x in Q by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
given Q being (Subset of S) such that
Q is  open
and
A15: (Q c= X & x in Q);

thus thesis by A15;
end;
hence thesis by TOPS_1:25;
end;

then A16: A is  open;
let X being (Subset of S);
assume that
A17: X = { p where p is (Point of S): ( f . p ) = ( g . p ) };
( X ` ) = A
proof
hereby
let x being set;
assume A18: x in ( X ` );
then (not x in X) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then ( f . x ) <> ( g . x ) by A17,A18;
hence x in A by A18;
end;
let x being set;
assume x in A;
then consider p being (Point of S) such that A19: x = p and A20: ( f . p ) <> ( g . p );
now
assume p in { t where t is (Point of S): ( f . t ) = ( g . t ) };
then (ex t being (Point of S) st (p = t & ( f . t ) = ( g . t )));
hence contradiction by A20;
end;
hence thesis by A17,A19,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
hence thesis by A16,TOPS_1:3;
end;
