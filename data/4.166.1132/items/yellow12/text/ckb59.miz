theorem
Th49: (((the carrier of S1) = (the carrier of S2) & (the carrier of T1) = (the carrier of T2)) implies ((the carrier of [: R1,R2 :]) = (the carrier of R) & (the topology of [: R1,R2 :]) = (the topology of R)))

hereby
let c being set;

c = [: ( U1 /\ U2 ),( V1 /\ V2 ) :] by A5,ZFMISC_1:100;
hence c in Bpr by A8,A9;
