theorem
(AP is  satisfying_DES1 implies AP is  satisfying_DES1_1)
proof
assume A1: AP is  satisfying_DES1;
let A;
let P;
let C;
let o;
let a;
let a9;
let b;
let b9;
let c;
let c9;
let p;
let q;
assume that
A2: A is  being_line
and
A3: P is  being_line
and
A4: C is  being_line
and
A5: P <> A
and
A6: P <> C
and

A30: (not  LIN o,a,c)
proof
assume  LIN o,a,c;
then c in A by A2,A8,A9,A15,AFF_1:25;
hence contradiction by A2,A4,A7,A8,A13,A17,AFF_1:18;

q <> b
proof
assume A40: q = b;
((not  LIN b,c,a) & c,a // q,p) by A20,A26,AFF_1:4,AFF_1:6;
hence contradiction by A18,A22,A40,AFF_1:55;

A44: (not  LIN b9,p,q)
proof
set N = ( Line (p,q) );
A45: N is  being_line by A18,AFF_1:def 3;
assume  LIN b9,p,q;
then  LIN p,q,b9 by AFF_1:6;
