theorem
Th26: (for X holds (ex R st R well_orders X))
proof
deffunc F(set) = { $1 };
defpred P[ set ]
 means
$1 is Ordinal;
let X;
consider Class being set such that A1: X in Class and A2: ((Y in Class & Z c= Y) implies Z in Class) and (Y in Class implies ( bool Y ) in Class) and A3: (Y c= Class implies (Y,Class are_equipotent  or Y in Class)) by ZFMISC_1:112;
consider ON being set such that A4: (x in ON iff (x in Class & P[ x ])) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
(for Y holds (Y in ON implies (Y is Ordinal & Y c= ON)))
proof
let Y;
assume A5: Y in ON;
hence Y is Ordinal by A4;
reconsider A = Y as Ordinal by A4,A5;
let x;
assume A6: x in Y;
then x in A;
then reconsider B = x as Ordinal;
A7: B c= A by A6,ORDINAL1:def 2;
A in Class by A4,A5;
then B in Class by A2,A7;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
then reconsider ON as Ordinal by ORDINAL1:19;
A8: ON c= Class
proof
let x;
thus thesis by A4;
end;
A9: ON,Class are_equipotent 
proof
assume (not thesis);
then ON in Class by A3,A8;
then ON in ON by A4;
hence contradiction;
end;
( field ( RelIncl ON ) ) = ON by CKB1:def 1;
then consider R such that A10: R well_orders Class by A9,CKB21:1,CKB7:1;
consider f such that A11: (( dom f ) = X & (for x holds (x in X implies ( f . x ) = F(x)))) from FUNCT_1:sch 3;
A12: ( rng f ) c= Class
proof
let x;
assume x in ( rng f );
then consider y such that A13: y in ( dom f ) and A14: x = ( f . y ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
A15: { y } c= X
proof
let z;
assume z in { y };
hence thesis by A11,A13,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
( f . y ) = { y } by A11,A13;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A14,A15;
end;
A16: X,( rng f ) are_equipotent 
proof
take f;
thus f is  one-to-one
proof
let x;
let y;
assume that
A17: (x in ( dom f ) & y in ( dom f ))
and
A18: ( f . x ) = ( f . y );
(( f . x ) = { x } & ( f . y ) = { y }) by A11,A17;
hence thesis by A18,ZFMISC_1:3;
end;

thus thesis by A11;
end;
set Q = ( R |_2 Class );
( field Q ) = Class by A10,CKB20:1;
then A19: ( field ( Q |_2 ( rng f ) ) ) = ( rng f ) by A10,A12,CKB20:1,WELLORD1:31;
Q is  well-ordering by A10,CKB20:1;
hence thesis by A16,A19,CKB21:1,WELLORD1:25;
end;
