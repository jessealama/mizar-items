definition
let X;
func RelIncl X -> Relation
means
:Def1: (( field it ) = X & (for Y holds (for Z holds ((Y in X & Z in X) implies ([ Y,Z ] in it iff Y c= Z)))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
$1 c= $2;
consider R such that A1: ([ x,y ] in R iff ((x in X & y in X) & P[ x,y ])) from RELAT_1:sch 1;
take R;
thus ( field R ) = X
proof
thus (x in ( field R ) implies x in X)
proof
A2:now
assume x in ( dom R );
then (ex y st [ x,y ] in R) by RELAT_1:def 4;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
A3:now
assume x in ( rng R );
then (ex y st [ y,x ] in R) by RELAT_1:def 5;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
assume x in ( field R );
hence thesis by A2,A3,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;

let x;
assume x in X;
then [ x,x ] in R by A1;
hence thesis by RELAT_1:15;
end;

let Y;
let Z;
assume that
A4: (Y in X & Z in X);
thus ([ Y,Z ] in R implies Y c= Z) by A1;
thus thesis by A1,A4;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let R1 being Relation,R2 being Relation;
assume that
A5: ( field R1 ) = X
and
A6: (for Y holds (for Z holds ((Y in X & Z in X) implies ([ Y,Z ] in R1 iff Y c= Z))))
and
A7: ( field R2 ) = X
and
A8: (for Y holds (for Z holds ((Y in X & Z in X) implies ([ Y,Z ] in R2 iff Y c= Z))));
let x;
let y;
thus ([ x,y ] in R1 implies [ x,y ] in R2)
proof
assume A9: [ x,y ] in R1;
then A10: (x in ( field R1 ) & y in ( field R1 )) by RELAT_1:15;
then x c= y by A5,A6,A9;
hence thesis by A5,A8,A10;
end;

assume A11: [ x,y ] in R2;
then A12: (x in ( field R2 ) & y in ( field R2 )) by RELAT_1:15;
then x c= y by A7,A8,A11;
hence thesis by A6,A7,A12;
end;
