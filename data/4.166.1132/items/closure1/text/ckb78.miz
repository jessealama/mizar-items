theorem
Th33: (for D being  properly-upper-bound (MSSubsetFamily of M) holds (ex J being (MSSetOp of M) st (for X being (Element of ( bool M )) holds (for SF being  non-empty (MSSubsetFamily of M) holds ((for Y being (ManySortedSet of I) holds (Y in SF iff (Y in D & X c= Y))) implies ( J .. X ) = ( meet SF ))))))
proof
let D being  properly-upper-bound (MSSubsetFamily of M);
set G = ( bool M );
defpred P[ set,set,set ]
 means
(for sf being (Subset-Family of ( M . $3 )) holds (for Fi being non  empty set holds ((Fi = ( D . $3 ) & sf = { z where z is (Element of Fi): $2 c= z }) implies $1 = ( Intersect sf ))));

proof
let s being set;
assume that
A8: s in I;
per cases ;
suppose s = i;

hence thesis by A4,A6;

suppose s <> i;

then (not s in ( dom ( i .--> x ) )) by A5,TARSKI:def 1;

then ( Intersect sf ) in b by A3,MBOOLEAN:def 1;
hence y in ( G . i ) by A4,FUNCOP_1:7;
thus P[ y,x,i ]
