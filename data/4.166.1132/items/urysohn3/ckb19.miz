theorem
Th13: (for T being non empty  normal TopSpace holds (for A,B being  closed (Subset of T) holds ((A <> ( {} ) & A misses B) implies (for G being (Rain of A,B) holds (for r1,r2 being Real holds (((r1 in ( DOM ) & r2 in ( DOM )) & r1 < r2) implies (for C being (Subset of T) holds (C = ( ( Tempest G ) . r1 ) implies ( Cl C ) c= ( ( Tempest G ) . r2 )))))))))
proof
let T being non empty  normal TopSpace;
let A being  closed (Subset of T),B being  closed (Subset of T);
assume A1: (A <> ( {} ) & A misses B);
let G being (Rain of A,B);
let r1 being Real,r2 being Real;
assume that
A2: r1 in ( DOM )
and
A3: r2 in ( DOM )
and
