definition
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
let A being (Subset of T);
let B being (Subset of T);
let G being (Rain of A,B);
let p being (Point of T);
func Rainbow (p,G) -> (Subset of ( ExtREAL )) means

existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(for s being Real holds (s = $1 implies (not p in ( ( Tempest G ) . s ))));
(ex X being set st (for x being set holds (x in X iff (x in ( DYADIC ) & P[ x ])))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
then consider R being set such that A1: (for x being set holds (x in R iff (x in ( DYADIC ) & P[ x ])));
R c= ( REAL )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in R;
then x in ( DYADIC ) by A1;
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider R as (Subset of ( ExtREAL )) by NUMBERS:31,XBOOLE_1:1;
take R;
thus thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let R1 being (Subset of ( ExtREAL ));
let R2 being (Subset of ( ExtREAL ));
assume that
A1: (for x being set holds (x in R1 iff (x in ( DYADIC ) & (for s being Real holds (s = x implies (not p in ( ( Tempest G ) . s )))))))
and
A2: (for x being set holds (x in R2 iff (x in ( DYADIC ) & (for s being Real holds (s = x implies (not p in ( ( Tempest G ) . s )))))));
(for x being set holds (x in R1 iff x in R2))
proof
let x being set;
hereby
assume x in R1;
then (x in ( DYADIC ) & (for s being Real holds (s = x implies (not p in ( ( Tempest G ) . s ))))) by A1;
hence x in R2 by A2;
end;
assume x in R2;
then (x in ( DYADIC ) & (for s being Real holds (s = x implies (not p in ( ( Tempest G ) . s ))))) by A2;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
