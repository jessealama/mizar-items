theorem
Th11: (for T being non  empty  normal TopSpace holds (for A,B being  closed (Subset of T) holds ((A <> ( {} ) & A misses B) implies (for G being (Rain of A,B) holds (ex F being (Function of ( DOM ),( bool (the carrier of T) )) st (for x being Real holds (x in ( DOM ) implies (((x in ( halfline ( 0 ) ) implies ( F . x ) = ( {} )) & (x in ( right_open_halfline 1 ) implies ( F . x ) = (the carrier of T))) & (x in ( DYADIC ) implies (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (x in ( dyadic n ) implies ( F . x ) = ( ( G . n ) . x ))))))))))))
proof
let T being non  empty  normal TopSpace;
let A being  closed (Subset of T);
let B being  closed (Subset of T);
assume A1: (A <> ( {} ) & A misses B);
let G being (Rain of A,B);
defpred P[ (Element of ( DOM )),set ]
 means
((($1 in ( halfline ( 0 ) ) implies $2 = ( {} )) & ($1 in ( right_open_halfline 1 ) implies $2 = (the carrier of T))) & ($1 in ( DYADIC ) implies (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ($1 in ( dyadic n ) implies $2 = ( ( G . n ) . $1 )))));
A2: (for x being (Element of ( DOM )) holds (ex y being (Subset of T) st P[ x,y ]))
proof
reconsider a = ( 0 ),b = 1 as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
let x being (Element of ( DOM ));
A3: (x in ( ( halfline ( 0 ) ) \/ ( DYADIC ) ) or x in ( right_open_halfline 1 )) by URYSOHN1:def 3,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
per cases  by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A4: x in ( halfline ( 0 ) );

A5: ((not x in ( right_open_halfline 1 )) & (not x in ( DYADIC )))
proof
assume A6: (x in ( right_open_halfline 1 ) or x in ( DYADIC ));
per cases  by A6;
suppose x in ( right_open_halfline 1 );

then 1 < x by XXREAL_1:235;
hence thesis by A4,XXREAL_1:233;
end;
suppose A7: x in ( DYADIC );

reconsider x as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
a <= x by A7,URYSOHN2:28,XXREAL_1:1;
hence thesis by A4,XXREAL_1:233;
end;
end;
reconsider s = ( {} ) as (Subset of T) by XBOOLE_1:2;
s = s;
hence thesis by A5;
end;
suppose A8: x in ( DYADIC );

A9: (not x in ( halfline ( 0 ) ))
proof
assume A10: x in ( halfline ( 0 ) );
reconsider x as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
a <= x by A8,URYSOHN2:28,XXREAL_1:1;
hence thesis by A10,XXREAL_1:233;
end;
A11: (not x in ( right_open_halfline 1 ))
proof
assume A12: x in ( right_open_halfline 1 );
reconsider x as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
x <= b by A8,URYSOHN2:28,XXREAL_1:1;
hence thesis by A12,XXREAL_1:235;
end;
(ex s being (Subset of T) st (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (x in ( dyadic n ) implies s = ( ( G . n ) . x )))) by A1,A8,CKB14:1;
hence thesis by A11,A9;
end;
suppose A13: x in ( right_open_halfline 1 );

A14: ((not x in ( halfline ( 0 ) )) & (not x in ( DYADIC )))
proof
assume A15: (x in ( halfline ( 0 ) ) or x in ( DYADIC ));
per cases  by A15;
suppose x in ( halfline ( 0 ) );

then x < ( 0 ) by XXREAL_1:233;
hence thesis by A13,XXREAL_1:235;
end;
suppose A16: x in ( DYADIC );

reconsider x as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
x <= b by A16,URYSOHN2:28,XXREAL_1:1;
hence thesis by A13,XXREAL_1:235;
end;
end;
(the carrier of T) c= (the carrier of T);
then reconsider s = (the carrier of T) as (Subset of T);
s = s;
hence thesis by A14;
end;
end;
(ex F being (Function of ( DOM ),( bool (the carrier of T) )) st (for x being (Element of ( DOM )) holds P[ x,( F . x ) ])) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A2);
then consider F being (Function of ( DOM ),( bool (the carrier of T) )) such that A17: (for x being (Element of ( DOM )) holds P[ x,( F . x ) ]);
take F;
thus thesis by A17;
end;
