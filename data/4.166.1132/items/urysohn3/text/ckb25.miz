theorem
Th19: (for T being non  empty  normal TopSpace holds (for A,B being  closed (Subset of T) holds ((A <> ( {} ) & A misses B) implies (for G being (Rain of A,B) holds (for r being Real holds ((r in ( ( DYADIC ) \/ ( right_open_halfline 1 ) ) & ( 0 ) < r) implies (for p being (Point of T) holds (p in ( ( Tempest G ) . r ) implies ( ( Thunder G ) . p ) <= r))))))))
