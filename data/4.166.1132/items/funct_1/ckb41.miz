theorem
(f is  one-to-one iff (for g holds (for h holds ((((( rng g ) c= ( dom f ) & ( rng h ) c= ( dom f )) & ( dom g ) = ( dom h )) & ( f * g ) = ( f * h )) implies g = h))))
proof
thus (f is  one-to-one implies (for g holds (for h holds ((((( rng g ) c= ( dom f ) & ( rng h ) c= ( dom f )) & ( dom g ) = ( dom h )) & ( f * g ) = ( f * h )) implies g = h))))
proof
assume A1: f is  one-to-one;
let g;
let h;
assume that
A2: (( rng g ) c= ( dom f ) & ( rng h ) c= ( dom f ))
and
A3: ( dom g ) = ( dom h )
and
A4: ( f * g ) = ( f * h );
(x in ( dom g ) implies ( g . x ) = ( h . x ))
proof
assume A5: x in ( dom g );
then A6: (( g . x ) in ( rng g ) & ( h . x ) in ( rng h )) by A3,CKB10:def 1;
(( ( f * g ) . x ) = ( f . ( g . x ) ) & ( ( f * h ) . x ) = ( f . ( h . x ) )) by A3,A5,CKB25:1;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A4,A6,CKB37:def 1;

hence thesis by A3,CKB9:1;

(((x1 in ( dom f ) & x2 in ( dom f )) & ( f . x1 ) = ( f . x2 )) implies x1 = x2)

(x in ( dom ( f * g ) ) implies ( ( f * g ) . x ) = ( ( f * h ) . x ))
proof
