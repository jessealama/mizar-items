theorem
(for T being  Lawson  complete TopLattice holds ( ( sigma T ) \/ { ( W \ ( uparrow x ) ) where W is (Subset of T),x is (Element of T): W in ( sigma T ) } ) is (prebasis of T))
proof
let T being  Lawson  complete TopLattice;
set R = the  lower  correct (TopAugmentation of T);
reconsider K = { ( ( uparrow x ) ` ) where x is (Element of R): (not contradiction) } as (prebasis of R) by CKB1:def 1;
set O = { ( W \ ( uparrow x ) ) where W is (Subset of T),x is (Element of T): W in ( sigma T ) };
O c= ( bool (the carrier of T) )
proof
let a being set;
assume a in O;
then (ex W being (Subset of T) st (ex x being (Element of T) st (a = ( W \ ( uparrow x ) ) & W in ( sigma T ))));
hence thesis;

proof
let a being set;

proof
let a being set;

reconsider y = x as (Element of T) by A1;
a = ( ( [#] T ) \ ( uparrow y ) ) by A1,A15,WAYBEL_0:13;
