scheme TopInd { T() -> TopLattice,P[set] } : (for A being (Subset of T()) holds (A is  open implies P[ A ]))
provided
A1: (ex K being (prebasis of T()) st (for A being (Subset of T()) holds (A in K implies P[ A ])))
and
A2: (for F being (Subset-Family of T()) holds ((for A being (Subset of T()) holds (A in F implies P[ A ])) implies P[ ( union F ) ]))
and
A3: (for A1,A2 being (Subset of T()) holds ((P[ A1 ] & P[ A2 ]) implies P[ ( A1 /\ A2 ) ]))
and
A4: P[ ( [#] T() ) ]
proof
consider K being (prebasis of T()) such that A5: (for A being (Subset of T()) holds (A in K implies P[ A ])) by A1;
let A being (Subset of T());
assume A6: A in (the topology of T());
( FinMeetCl K ) is (Basis of T()) by YELLOW_9:23;
then ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl K ) ) = (the topology of T()) by YELLOW_9:22;
then consider X being (Subset-Family of T()) such that A7: X c= ( FinMeetCl K ) and A8: A = ( union X ) by A6,CANTOR_1:def 1;
reconsider X as (Subset-Family of T());
now
defpred Q[ set ]
 means
(for a being (Subset-Family of T()) holds (a = $1 implies P[ ( Intersect a ) ]));
let A being (Subset of T());
assume A in X;
then consider Y being (Subset-Family of T()) such that A9: Y c= K and A10: Y is  finite and A11: A = ( Intersect Y ) by A7,CANTOR_1:def 3;
A12: (for x,Z being set holds (((x in Y & Z c= Y) & Q[ Z ]) implies Q[ ( Z \/ { x } ) ]))
proof
let x being set;
let Z being set;
assume that
A13: x in Y
and
A14: Z c= Y
and
A15: Q[ Z ];
reconsider xx = { x },Z9 = Z as (Subset-Family of T()) by A13,A14,XBOOLE_1:1,ZFMISC_1:31;
reconsider xx,Z9 as (Subset-Family of T());
reconsider xx,Z9 as (Subset-Family of T());
reconsider Ax = x,Ay = ( Intersect Z9 ) as (Subset of T()) by A13;
A16: P[ Ay ] by A15;
let a being (Subset-Family of T());
assume A17: a = ( Z \/ { x } );
( Intersect xx ) = Ax by MSSUBFAM:9;
then A18: ( Intersect a ) = ( Ax /\ Ay ) by A17,MSSUBFAM:8;
P[ Ax ] by A5,A9,A13;
hence thesis by A18,A3,A16;
end;
A19: Q[ ( {} ) ] by A4,SETFAM_1:def 9;
Q[ Y ] from FINSET_1:sch 2(A10,A19,A12);
hence P[ A ] by A11;
