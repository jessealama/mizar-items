theorem
Th11: (for S,T being  lower  complete TopLattice holds (for f being (Function of S,T) holds (f is  continuous implies f is  filtered-infs-preserving)))
proof
let S being  lower  complete TopLattice;
let T being  lower  complete TopLattice;
reconsider BB = { ( ( uparrow x ) ` ) where x is (Element of S): (not contradiction) } as (prebasis of S) by CKB1:def 1;
let f being (Function of S,T);
assume that
A1: f is  continuous;
let F being (Subset of S);
assume that
A2: F is non  empty  filtered
and
 ex_inf_of F,S;
(for A being (Subset of S) holds ((A in BB & ( inf F ) in A) implies F meets A))
proof
let A being (Subset of S);
assume A in BB;
then consider x being (Element of S) such that A3: A = ( ( uparrow x ) ` );
assume ( inf F ) in A;
then (not ( inf F ) >= x) by A3,YELLOW_9:1;
then (not F is_>=_than x) by YELLOW_0:33;
then consider y being (Element of S) such that A4: y in F and A5: (not y >= x) by LATTICE3:def 8;
y in A by A3,A5,YELLOW_9:1;
hence thesis by A4,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
then A6: ( inf F ) in ( Cl F ) by A2,CKB15:1;
A7: f is  monotone
proof
let x being (Element of S);
let y being (Element of S);
assume that
A8: x <= y;
( f . x ) <= ( f . x );
then ( f . x ) in ( uparrow ( f . x ) ) by WAYBEL_0:18;
then A9: x in ( f " ( uparrow ( f . x ) ) ) by FUNCT_2:38;
( uparrow ( f . x ) ) is  closed by CKB9:1;
then ( f " ( uparrow ( f . x ) ) ) is  closed by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 6;
then ( f " ( uparrow ( f . x ) ) ) is  upper by CKB11:1;
then y in ( f " ( uparrow ( f . x ) ) ) by A9,A8,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
then ( f . y ) in ( uparrow ( f . x ) ) by FUNCT_2:38;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:18;
end;
( f . ( inf F ) ) is_<=_than ( f .: F )
proof
let x being (Element of T);
assume x in ( f .: F );
then consider a being set such that A10: a in (the carrier of S) and A11: a in F and A12: x = ( f . a ) by FUNCT_2:64;
reconsider a as (Element of S) by A10;
( inf F ) is_<=_than F by YELLOW_0:33;
then ( inf F ) <= a by A11,LATTICE3:def 8;
hence thesis by A7,A12,WAYBEL_1:def 2;
end;
then A13: ( f . ( inf F ) ) <= ( inf ( f .: F ) ) by YELLOW_0:33;
thus  ex_inf_of ( f .: F ),T by YELLOW_0:17;
F c= ( f " ( uparrow ( inf ( f .: F ) ) ) )
proof
let x being set;
assume A14: x in F;
then reconsider s = x as (Element of S);
( f . s ) in ( f .: F ) by A14,FUNCT_2:35;
then ( inf ( f .: F ) ) <= ( f . s ) by YELLOW_2:22;
then ( f . s ) in ( uparrow ( inf ( f .: F ) ) ) by WAYBEL_0:18;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:38;
end;
then A15: ( Cl F ) c= ( Cl ( f " ( uparrow ( inf ( f .: F ) ) ) ) ) by PRE_TOPC:19;
( uparrow ( inf ( f .: F ) ) ) is  closed by CKB9:1;
then ( f " ( uparrow ( inf ( f .: F ) ) ) ) is  closed by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 6;
then ( Cl F ) c= ( f " ( uparrow ( inf ( f .: F ) ) ) ) by A15,PRE_TOPC:22;
then ( f . ( inf F ) ) in ( uparrow ( inf ( f .: F ) ) ) by A6,FUNCT_2:38;
then ( f . ( inf F ) ) >= ( inf ( f .: F ) ) by WAYBEL_0:18;
hence ( inf ( f .: F ) ) = ( f . ( inf F ) ) by A13,ORDERS_2:2;
end;
