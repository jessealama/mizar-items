theorem
Th7: (for T being non  empty  TopSpace-like TopRelStr holds (T is  lower iff { ( ( uparrow F ) ` ) where F is (Subset of T): F is  finite } is (Basis of T)))
proof
let T being non  empty  TopSpace-like TopRelStr;
set BB = { ( ( uparrow x ) ` ) where x is (Element of T): (not contradiction) };
BB c= ( bool (the carrier of T) )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in BB;
then (ex y being (Element of T) st x = ( ( uparrow y ) ` ));
hence thesis;

proof

 means
(ex x being (Element of T) st (x = $2 & $1 = ( ( uparrow x ) ` )));
hereby
deffunc F((Element of T9)) = ( uparrow $1 );
let a being set;
assume a in A;
then consider F being (Subset of T) such that A2: a = ( ( uparrow F ) ` ) and A3: F is  finite;
set Y = { ( uparrow x ) where x is (Element of T): x in F };
Y c= ( bool (the carrier of T) )
proof

proof

A17: ( COMPLEMENT X ) = Y
proof
hereby
let a being set;
assume a in ( COMPLEMENT X );
then consider x being (Element of T9) such that A18: a = ( ( uparrow x ) ` ) and A19: x in F by A16;
consider y being set such that A20: y in Y and A21: x = ( f . y ) by A12,A19,FUNCT_1:def 3;
