theorem
Th25: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (for K being (prebasis of T) holds (for N being (net of T) holds (for p being (Point of T) holds ((for A being (Subset of T) holds ((p in A & A in K) implies N is_eventually_in A)) implies p in ( Lim N ))))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
let K being (prebasis of T);
let N being (net of T);
let x being (Point of T);
assume that
A1: (for A being (Subset of T) holds ((x in A & A in K) implies N is_eventually_in A));
now
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(for i,j being (Element of N) holds ((i = $2 & j >= i) implies ( N . j ) in $1));
let A being (a_neighborhood of x);
A2: ( Int A ) in (the topology of T) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
( FinMeetCl K ) is (Basis of T) by YELLOW_9:23;
then (the topology of T) = ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl K ) ) by YELLOW_9:22;
then consider Y being (Subset-Family of T) such that A3: Y c= ( FinMeetCl K ) and A4: ( Int A ) = ( union Y ) by A2,CANTOR_1:def 1;
x in ( Int A ) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
then consider y being set such that A5: x in y and A6: y in Y by A4,TARSKI:def 4;
consider Z being (Subset-Family of T) such that A7: Z c= K and A8: Z is  finite and A9: y = ( Intersect Z ) by A3,A6,CANTOR_1:def 3;
A10: (for a being set holds (a in Z implies (ex b being set st (b in (the carrier of N) & P[ a,b ]))))
proof
let a being set;
assume A11: a in Z;
then reconsider a as (Subset of T);
x in a by A5,A9,A11,SETFAM_1:43;
then N is_eventually_in a by A1,A7,A11;
then consider i being (Element of N) such that A12: (for j being (Element of N) holds (j >= i implies ( N . j ) in a)) by WAYBEL_0:def 11;
take i;
thus thesis by A12;
end;
consider f being Function such that A13: (( dom f ) = Z & ( rng f ) c= (the carrier of N)) and A14: (for a being set holds (a in Z implies P[ a,( f . a ) ])) from FUNCT_1:sch 5(A10);
reconsider z = ( rng f ) as  finite (Subset of ( [#] N )) by A8,A13,FINSET_1:8;
( [#] N ) is  directed by WAYBEL_0:def 6;
then consider k being (Element of N) such that k in ( [#] N ) and A15: k is_>=_than z by WAYBEL_0:1;
thus N is_eventually_in A
proof
take k;
let i being (Element of N);
A16: ( Int A ) c= A by TOPS_1:16;
assume A17: i >= k;
now
let a being set;
assume A18: a in Z;
then A19: ( f . a ) in z by A13,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then reconsider j = ( f . a ) as (Element of N);
j <= k by A15,A19,LATTICE3:def 9;
hence ( N . i ) in a by A14,A17,A18,ORDERS_2:3;
end;
then A20: ( N . i ) in y by A9,SETFAM_1:43;
y c= ( union Y ) by A6,ZFMISC_1:74;
then ( N . i ) in ( Int A ) by A20,A4;
hence thesis by A16;
end;

end;
hence thesis by YELLOW_6:def 15;
end;
