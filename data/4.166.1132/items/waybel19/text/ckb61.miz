theorem
(for T being  Lawson  complete TopLattice holds (for F being non  empty  filtered (Subset of T) holds ( Lim ( F opp+id ) ) = { ( inf F ) }))
proof
let T being  Lawson  complete TopLattice;
reconsider K = ( ( sigma T ) \/ { ( ( uparrow x ) ` ) where x is (Element of T): (not contradiction) } ) as (prebasis of T) by CKB44:1;
set S = the  Scott (TopAugmentation of T);
let F being non  empty  filtered (Subset of T);
set N = ( F opp+id );
A1: (the carrier of N) = F by YELLOW_9:7;
A2: N is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( T opp )) by YELLOW_9:7;
thus ( Lim N ) c= { ( inf F ) }
proof
let p being set;
assume A3: p in ( Lim N );
then reconsider p as (Element of T);
(the mapping of N) = ( id F ) by CKB37:1;
then ( rng (the mapping of N) ) = F by RELAT_1:45;
then A4: p in ( Cl F ) by A3,WAYBEL_9:24;
p is_<=_than F
proof
let u being (Element of T);
assume A5: u in F;
A6: N is_eventually_in ( downarrow u )
proof
reconsider i = u as (Element of N) by A5,YELLOW_9:7;
take i;
let j being (Element of N);
j in F by A1;
then reconsider z = j as (Element of T);
assume j >= i;
then ( z ~ ) >= ( u ~ ) by A2,YELLOW_0:59;
then z <= u by LATTICE3:9;
then z in ( downarrow u ) by WAYBEL_0:17;
hence thesis by YELLOW_9:7;
end;
( downarrow u ) is  closed by CKB56:1;
then ( Cl ( downarrow u ) ) = ( downarrow u ) by PRE_TOPC:22;
then ( Lim N ) c= ( downarrow u ) by A6,CKB36:1;
hence thesis by A3,WAYBEL_0:17;
end;
then A7: p <= ( inf F ) by YELLOW_0:33;
( inf F ) is_<=_than F by YELLOW_0:33;
then A8: F c= ( uparrow ( inf F ) ) by YELLOW_2:2;
( uparrow ( inf F ) ) is  closed by CKB56:1;
then ( Cl ( uparrow ( inf F ) ) ) = ( uparrow ( inf F ) ) by PRE_TOPC:22;

then p >= ( inf F ) by A4,WAYBEL_0:18;
then p = ( inf F ) by A7,ORDERS_2:2;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 1;
end;

A9: (the topology of S) = ( sigma T ) by YELLOW_9:51;
A10: ( the RelStr of S ) = ( the RelStr of T ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
now
let A being (Subset of T);
assume that
A11: ( inf F ) in A
and
A12: A in K;
per cases  by A12,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A13: A in ( sigma T );

then reconsider a = A as (Subset of S) by A9;
set i = the (Element of N);
a is  open by A9,A13,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then a is  upper by WAYBEL11:def 4;
then A14: A is  upper by A10,WAYBEL_0:25;
thus N is_eventually_in A
proof
take i;
let j being (Element of N);
j in F by A1;
then reconsider z = j as (Element of T);
z >= ( inf F ) by A1,YELLOW_2:22;
then z in A by A11,A14,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
hence thesis by YELLOW_9:7;
end;

end;
suppose A in { ( ( uparrow x ) ` ) where x is (Element of T): (not contradiction) };

then consider x being (Element of T) such that A15: A = ( ( uparrow x ) ` );
(not ( inf F ) >= x) by A11,A15,YELLOW_9:1;
then (not F is_>=_than x) by YELLOW_0:33;
then consider y being (Element of T) such that A16: y in F and A17: (not y >= x) by LATTICE3:def 8;
thus N is_eventually_in A
proof
reconsider i = y as (Element of N) by A16,YELLOW_9:7;
take i;
let j being (Element of N);
j in F by A1;
then reconsider z = j as (Element of T);
assume j >= i;
then ( z ~ ) >= ( y ~ ) by A2,YELLOW_0:59;
then z <= y by LATTICE3:9;
then (not z >= x) by A17,ORDERS_2:3;
then z in A by A15,YELLOW_9:1;
hence thesis by YELLOW_9:7;
end;

end;
end;
then ( inf F ) in ( Lim N ) by CKB35:1;
hence thesis by ZFMISC_1:31;
