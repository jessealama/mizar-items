theorem
(for T1,S1,T2,S2 being non  empty TopSpace holds (for R1 being (Refinement of T1,S1) holds (for R2 being (Refinement of T2,S2) holds (for f being (Function of T1,T2) holds (for g being (Function of S1,S2) holds (for h being (Function of R1,R2) holds ((h = f & h = g) implies ((f is  continuous & g is  continuous) implies h is  continuous))))))))
proof
let T1 being non  empty TopSpace;
let S1 being non  empty TopSpace;
let T2 being non  empty TopSpace;
let S2 being non  empty TopSpace;
let R1 being (Refinement of T1,S1);
let R2 being (Refinement of T2,S2);
let f being (Function of T1,T2);
let g being (Function of S1,S2);
let h being (Function of R1,R2);
assume that
A1: h = f
and
A2: h = g;
A3: ( [#] S2 ) <> ( {} );
reconsider K = ( (the topology of T2) \/ (the topology of S2) ) as (prebasis of R2) by YELLOW_9:def 6;
A4: ( [#] T2 ) <> ( {} );
assume A5: f is  continuous;
assume A6: g is  continuous;
now
let A being (Subset of R2);
assume A7: A in K;
per cases  by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A8: A in (the topology of T2);

then reconsider A1 = A as (Subset of T2);
A1 is  open by A8,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then ( f " A1 ) is  open by A4,A5,TOPS_2:43;
hence ( h " A ) is  open by A1,CKB30:1;
end;
suppose A9: A in (the topology of S2);

then reconsider A1 = A as (Subset of S2);
A1 is  open by A9,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then A10: ( g " A1 ) is  open by A3,A6,TOPS_2:43;
R1 is (Refinement of S1,T1) by YELLOW_9:55;
hence ( h " A ) is  open by A10,A2,CKB30:1;
end;
end;
hence thesis by YELLOW_9:36;
end;
