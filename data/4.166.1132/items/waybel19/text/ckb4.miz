theorem
Th1: (for LL being non  empty RelStr holds (ex T being  strict  correct (TopAugmentation of LL) st T is  lower))
proof
let LL being non  empty RelStr;
set A = { ( ( uparrow x ) ` ) where x is (Element of LL): (not contradiction) };
A c= ( bool (the carrier of LL) )
proof
let a being set;
assume a in A;
then (ex x being (Element of LL) st a = ( ( uparrow x ) ` ));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider A as (Subset-Family of LL);
set T = TopRelStr (# (the carrier of LL),(the InternalRel of LL),( UniCl ( FinMeetCl A ) ) #);
reconsider S = TopStruct (# (the carrier of LL),( UniCl ( FinMeetCl A ) ) #) as non  empty TopSpace by CANTOR_1:15;
A1: ( the TopStruct of T ) = S;
T is  TopSpace-like
proof
thus (the carrier of T) in (the topology of T) by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 1;
hereby
let a being (Subset-Family of T);
reconsider b = a as (Subset-Family of S);
assume a c= (the topology of T);
then ( union b ) in (the topology of S) by PRE_TOPC:def 1;
hence ( union a ) in (the topology of T);
end;
let a being (Subset of T);
let b being (Subset of T);
assume that
A2: a in (the topology of T)
and
A3: b in (the topology of T);
( a /\ b ) in (the topology of S) by A2,A3,PRE_TOPC:def 1;
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider T as  strict non  empty  TopSpace-like TopRelStr;
take T;
set BB = { ( ( uparrow x ) ` ) where x is (Element of T): (not contradiction) };
( the RelStr of T ) = ( the RelStr of LL );
hence T is  strict  correct  strict  correct (TopAugmentation of LL) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
A4: A is (prebasis of S) by CANTOR_1:18;

A6: (the topology of T) c= ( UniCl F ) by CANTOR_1:def 2;
