theorem
Th8: (for S,T being  lower  complete TopLattice holds (for f being (Function of S,T) holds ((for X being non  empty (Subset of S) holds f preserves_inf_of X) implies f is  continuous)))
proof
let S being  lower  complete non  empty TopLattice;
let T being  lower  complete non  empty TopLattice;
reconsider BB = { ( ( uparrow x ) ` ) where x is (Element of T): (not contradiction) } as (prebasis of T) by CKB1:def 1;
let f being (Function of S,T);
assume that
A1: (for X being non  empty (Subset of S) holds f preserves_inf_of X);
now
let A being (Subset of T);
A2:  ex_inf_of ( f " ( A ` ) ),S by YELLOW_0:17;
A3:  ex_inf_of ( A ` ),T by YELLOW_0:17;
A4:  ex_inf_of ( f .: ( f " ( A ` ) ) ),T by YELLOW_0:17;
assume A in BB;
then consider x being (Element of T) such that A5: A = ( ( uparrow x ) ` );
set s = ( inf ( f " ( uparrow x ) ) );
per cases ;
suppose ( f " ( A ` ) ) = ( {} S );

hence ( f " ( A ` ) ) is  closed;
end;
suppose ( f " ( A ` ) ) <> ( {} );

then f preserves_inf_of ( f " ( A ` ) ) by A1;
then A6: ( f . s ) = ( inf ( f .: ( f " ( A ` ) ) ) ) by A5,A2,WAYBEL_0:def 30;
( inf ( A ` ) ) = x by A5,WAYBEL_0:39;
then A7: x <= ( f . s ) by A6,A3,A4,FUNCT_1:75,YELLOW_0:35;
( f " ( A ` ) ) = ( uparrow s )
proof
thus ( f " ( A ` ) ) c= ( uparrow s )
proof
let a being set;
assume A8: a in ( f " ( A ` ) );
then reconsider a as (Element of S);
s <= a by A5,A8,YELLOW_2:22;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:18;
end;

let a being set;
assume A9: a in ( uparrow s );
then reconsider a as (Element of S);
f preserves_inf_of { s,a } by A1;
then A10: ( f . ( s "/\" a ) ) = ( ( f . s ) "/\" ( f . a ) ) by YELLOW_3:8;
s <= a by A9,WAYBEL_0:18;
then ( f . s ) = ( ( f . s ) "/\" ( f . a ) ) by A10,YELLOW_5:10;
then ( f . s ) <= ( f . a ) by YELLOW_0:23;
then x <= ( f . a ) by A7,ORDERS_2:3;
then ( f . a ) in ( uparrow x ) by WAYBEL_0:18;
hence thesis by A5,FUNCT_2:38;
end;
hence ( f " ( A ` ) ) is  closed by CKB9:1;
end;
end;
hence thesis by YELLOW_9:35;
end;
