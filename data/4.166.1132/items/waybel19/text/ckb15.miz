theorem
Th10: (for T being  lower  complete TopLattice holds (for BB being (prebasis of T) holds (for F being non  empty  filtered (Subset of T) holds ((for A being (Subset of T) holds ((A in BB & ( inf F ) in A) implies F meets A)) implies ( inf F ) in ( Cl F )))))
proof
let T being  lower  complete TopLattice;
let BB being (prebasis of T);
let F being non  empty  filtered (Subset of T);
assume that
A1: (for A being (Subset of T) holds ((A in BB & ( inf F ) in A) implies F meets A));
set N = ( F opp+id );
set x = ( inf F );
A2: (for A being (Subset of T) holds ((A in BB & x in A) implies N is_eventually_in A))
proof
let A being (Subset of T);
assume that
A3: A in BB
and
A4: x in A;
A is  open by A3,TOPS_2:def 1;
then A5: A is  lower by CKB10:1;
F meets A by A3,A4,A1;
then consider i being set such that A6: i in F and A7: i in A by XBOOLE_0:3;
reconsider i as (Element of N) by A6,YELLOW_9:7;
take i;
let j being (Element of N);
A8: N is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( T opp )) by YELLOW_9:7;
then reconsider a = i,b = j as (Element of ( T opp )) by YELLOW_0:58;
assume i <= j;
then a <= b by A8,YELLOW_0:59;
then A9: ( ~ b ) <= ( ~ a ) by YELLOW_7:1;
( N . j ) = j by YELLOW_9:7;
hence thesis by A9,A7,A5,WAYBEL_0:def 19;
end;
A10: (the carrier of N) = F by YELLOW_9:7;
( rng ( netmap (N,T) ) ) c= F
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( rng ( netmap (N,T) ) );
then consider a being set such that A11: a in ( dom ( netmap (N,T) ) ) and A12: x = ( ( netmap (N,T) ) . a ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider a as (Element of N) by A11;
x = ( N . a ) by A12
.= a by YELLOW_9:7;
hence thesis by A10;
end;
hence thesis by A2,YELLOW_9:39;
end;
