cluster  Lawson ->  T_1  compact for  complete  complete TopLattice;
coherence
proof
let T being  complete TopLattice;
assume that
A1: T is  Lawson;
(for x being (Point of T) holds { x } is  closed) by A1,CKB56:1;
hence T is  T_1 by URYSOHN1:19;
set O1 = ( sigma T );
set O2 = { ( ( uparrow x ) ` ) where x is (Element of T): (not contradiction) };
reconsider K = ( O1 \/ O2 ) as (prebasis of T) by A1,CKB44:1;
set S = the  Scott (TopAugmentation of T);
(the carrier of ( InclPoset (the topology of T) )) = (the topology of T) by YELLOW_1:1;
then reconsider X = (the carrier of T) as (Element of ( InclPoset (the topology of T) )) by PRE_TOPC:def 1;
A2: ( the RelStr of S ) = ( the RelStr of T ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
(for F being (Subset of K) holds (X c= ( union F ) implies (ex G being  finite (Subset of F) st X c= ( union G ))))
proof
deffunc F((Element of T)) = ( ( uparrow $1 ) ` );
let F being (Subset of K);
set I2 = { x where x is (Element of T): ( ( uparrow x ) ` ) in F };
set x = ( "\/" (I2,T) );
A3: I2 c= (the carrier of T)
proof
let a being set;
assume a in I2;
then (ex x being (Element of T) st (a = x & ( ( uparrow x ) ` ) in F));
hence thesis;
end;
reconsider z = x as (Element of S) by A2;
assume A4: X c= ( union F );
x in X;
then consider Y being set such that A5: x in Y and A6: Y in F by A4,TARSKI:def 4;
Y in K by A6;
then reconsider I2,Y as (Subset of T) by A3;
reconsider Z = Y,J2 = I2 as (Subset of S) by A2;
now
assume (not Y in O1);
then Y in O2 by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then consider y being (Element of T) such that A7: Y = ( ( uparrow y ) ` );
y in I2 by A6,A7;
then y <= x by YELLOW_2:22;
hence contradiction by A5,A7,YELLOW_9:1;
end;
then Z in (the topology of S) by YELLOW_9:51;
then A8: Z is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then A9: Z is  upper by WAYBEL11:15;
A10: z = ( sup J2 ) by A2,YELLOW_0:17,YELLOW_0:26
.= ( sup ( finsups J2 ) ) by WAYBEL_0:55;
Z is  property(S) by A8,WAYBEL11:15;
then consider y being (Element of S) such that A11: y in ( finsups J2 ) and A12: (for x being (Element of S) holds ((x in ( finsups J2 ) & x >= y) implies x in Z)) by A10,A5,WAYBEL11:def 3;
consider a being  finite (Subset of J2) such that A13: y = ( "\/" (a,S) ) and  ex_sup_of a,S by A11;
set AA = { ( ( uparrow c ) ` ) where c is (Element of T): c in a };
set G = ( { Y } \/ AA );
A14: G c= F
proof
let i being set;
assume that
A15: i in G
and
A16: (not i in F);
(i in { Y } or i in AA) by A15,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then consider c being (Element of T) such that A17: i = ( ( uparrow c ) ` ) and A18: c in a by A6,A16,TARSKI:def 1;
c in J2 by A18;
then (ex c9 being (Element of T) st (c = c9 & ( ( uparrow c9 ) ` ) in F));
hence contradiction by A16,A17;
end;
A19: a is  finite;
{ F(c) where c is (Element of T): c in a } is  finite from FRAENKEL:sch 21(A19);
then reconsider G as  finite (Subset of F) by A14;
take G;
let u being set;
assume that
A20: u in X
and
A21: (not u in ( union G ));
reconsider u as (Element of S) by A20,A2;
A22: ( union G ) = ( ( union { Y } ) \/ ( union AA ) ) by ZFMISC_1:78
.= ( Y \/ ( union AA ) ) by ZFMISC_1:25;
then A23: (not u in Y) by A21,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
A24: (not u in ( union AA )) by A22,A21,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
A25: (y <= y & u is_>=_than a)
proof
thus y <= y;
let v being (Element of S);
assume A26: v in a;
then v in J2;
then consider c being (Element of T) such that A27: v = c and ( ( uparrow c ) ` ) in F;
( ( uparrow c ) ` ) in AA by A26,A27;
then A28: (not u in ( ( uparrow c ) ` )) by A24,TARSKI:def 4;
( ( uparrow c ) ` ) = ( ( uparrow v ) ` ) by A2,A27,WAYBEL_0:13;
hence thesis by A28,YELLOW_9:1;
end;
then A29: u >= y by A13,YELLOW_0:32;
y in Z by A25,A11,A12;
hence thesis by A29,A9,A23,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
end;
then X << X by WAYBEL_7:31;
then X is  compact by WAYBEL_3:def 2;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_3:37;
