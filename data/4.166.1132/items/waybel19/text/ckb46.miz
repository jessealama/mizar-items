theorem
(for T being  Lawson  complete TopLattice holds { ( W \ ( uparrow F ) ) where W is (Subset of T),F is (Subset of T): (W in ( sigma T ) & F is  finite) } is (Basis of T))
proof
let T being  Lawson  complete TopLattice;
set R = the  lower  correct (TopAugmentation of T);
reconsider B2 = { ( ( uparrow F ) ` ) where F is (Subset of R): F is  finite } as (Basis of R) by CKB12:1;
set Z = { ( W \ ( uparrow F ) ) where W is (Subset of T),F is (Subset of T): (W in ( sigma T ) & F is  finite) };
set S = the  Scott (TopAugmentation of T);
A1: (the topology of S) = ( sigma T ) by YELLOW_9:51;
then reconsider B1 = ( sigma T ) as (Basis of S) by CANTOR_1:2;
A2: ( the RelStr of R ) = ( the RelStr of T ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
B1 c= Z
proof
set F9 = ( {} R );
reconsider G = F9 as (Subset of T) by A2;
let x being set;
assume A3: x in B1;
then reconsider x9 = x as (Subset of T);
( uparrow G ) = ( uparrow F9 );
then ( x9 \ ( uparrow G ) ) = x9;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
then A4: ( B1 \/ Z ) = Z by XBOOLE_1:12;
A5: ( INTERSECTION (B1,B2) ) = Z
proof
hereby
let x being set;
assume x in ( INTERSECTION (B1,B2) );
then consider y,z being set such that A6: y in B1 and A7: z in B2 and A8: x = ( y /\ z ) by SETFAM_1:def 5;
reconsider y as (Subset of T) by A6;
A9: ( ( [#] T ) /\ y ) = y by XBOOLE_1:28;
consider F being (Subset of R) such that A10: z = ( ( uparrow F ) ` ) and A11: F is  finite by A7;
reconsider G = F as (Subset of T) by A2;
z = ( ( uparrow G ) ` ) by A2,A10,WAYBEL_0:13;
then x = ( y \ ( uparrow G ) ) by A9,A8,XBOOLE_1:49;
hence x in Z by A6,A11;
end;
let x being set;
assume x in Z;
then consider W,F being (Subset of T) such that A12: x = ( W \ ( uparrow F ) ) and A13: W in ( sigma T ) and A14: F is  finite;
( W /\ ( [#] T ) ) = W by XBOOLE_1:28;
then A15: x = ( W /\ ( ( [#] T ) \ ( uparrow F ) ) ) by A12,XBOOLE_1:49;
reconsider G = F as (Subset of R) by A2;
A16: ( ( uparrow G ) ` ) in B2 by A14;
( ( uparrow F ) ` ) = ( ( uparrow G ) ` ) by A2,WAYBEL_0:13;
hence thesis by A16,A13,A15,SETFAM_1:def 5;
end;
A17: ( the RelStr of S ) = ( the RelStr of T ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
B2 c= Z
proof
let x being set;
assume x in B2;
then consider F being (Subset of R) such that A18: x = ( ( uparrow F ) ` ) and A19: F is  finite;
A20: (the carrier of S) in B1 by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 1;
reconsider G = F as (Subset of T) by A2;
( uparrow F ) = ( uparrow G ) by A2,WAYBEL_0:13;
hence thesis by A17,A20,A2,A18,A19;
end;
then A21: ( B2 \/ Z ) = Z by XBOOLE_1:12;
T is (TopAugmentation of T) by YELLOW_9:44;
then T is (Refinement of S,R) by CKB40:1;
then ( ( B1 \/ B2 ) \/ ( INTERSECTION (B1,B2) ) ) is (Basis of T) by YELLOW_9:59;
hence thesis by A4,A5,A21,XBOOLE_1:4;
