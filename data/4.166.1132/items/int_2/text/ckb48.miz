theorem
(l >= 2 implies (ex p being (Element of ( NAT )) st (p is  prime & p divides l)))
proof
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
(ex p st (p is  prime & p divides $1));
A1: (for k being Nat holds (k >= 2 implies ((for n being Nat holds (n >= 2 implies (n < k implies P[ n ]))) implies P[ k ])))
proof
let k being Nat;
assume A2: k >= 2;
assume A3: (for n being Nat holds (n >= 2 implies (n < k implies (ex p st (p is  prime & p divides n)))));
A4: ( ( k + 1 ) - 1 ) > ( ( 1 + 1 ) - 1 ) by A2,NAT_1:13;
((not k is  prime) implies (ex p being (Element of ( NAT )) st (p is  prime & p divides k)))
proof
assume (not k is  prime);
then consider m being  natural number such that A5: m divides k and A6: m <> 1 and A7: m <> k by A4,CKB41:def 1;
m <> ( 0 ) by A5,A7,CKB4:1;
then m > ( 0 ) by NAT_1:3;
then m >= ( ( 0 ) + 1 ) by NAT_1:13;
then m > 1 by A6,XXREAL_0:1;
then A8: m >= ( 1 + 1 ) by NAT_1:13;
k > ( 0 ) by A2,XXREAL_0:2;
then m <= k by A5,CKB42:1;
then m < k by A7,XXREAL_0:1;
then consider p1 such that A9: (p1 is  prime & p1 divides m) by A3,A8;
reconsider p1 as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
take p1;
thus thesis by A5,A9,CKB6:1;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
A10: (for k being Nat holds (k >= 2 implies P[ k ])) from NAT_1:sch 9(A1);
assume l >= 2;
then consider p such that A11: (p is  prime & p divides l) by A10;
reconsider p as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
take p;
thus thesis by A11;
end;
