definition
let T being TopSpace;
let F being (Subset-Family of T);
func Fr F -> (Subset-Family of T)
means
:Def1: (for A being (Subset of T) holds (A in it iff (ex B being (Subset of T) st (A = ( Fr B ) & B in F))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex W being (Subset of T) st ($1 = ( Fr W ) & W in F));
thus (ex S being (Subset-Family of T) st (for Z being (Subset of T) holds (Z in S iff P[ Z ]))) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
end;
uniqueness
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex W being (Subset of T) st ($1 = ( Fr W ) & W in F));
let H being (Subset-Family of T),G being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A1: (for Z being (Subset of T) holds (Z in H iff P[ Z ]))
and
A2: (for X being (Subset of T) holds (X in G iff P[ X ]));
now
let X being set;
assume A3: X in G;
then reconsider X9 = X as (Subset of T);
P[ X9 ] by A2,A3;
hence X in H by A1;
end;
then A4: G c= H by TARSKI:def 3;
now
let Z being set;
assume Z in H;
then P[ Z ] by A1;
hence Z in G by A2;
end;
then H c= G by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
