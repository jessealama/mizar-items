theorem
(for T being non empty TopSpace holds (for A being (Subset of T) holds (for p being (Point of T) holds (p in ( Fr A ) iff (for B being (Basis of p) holds (for U being (Subset of T) holds (U in B implies (A meets U & ( U \ A ) <> ( {} )))))))))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
let A being (Subset of T);
let p being (Point of T);
hereby
assume A1: p in ( Fr A );
let B being (Basis of p);
let U being (Subset of T);
assume U in B;
then (U is  open & p in U) by YELLOW_8:12;
hence (A meets U & ( U \ A ) <> ( {} )) by A1,CKB17:1;
end;
assume A2: (for B being (Basis of p) holds (for U being (Subset of T) holds (U in B implies (A meets U & ( U \ A ) <> ( {} )))));
(for U being (Subset of T) holds ((U is  open & p in U) implies (A meets U & U meets ( A ` ))))
proof
set B = the (Basis of p);
let U being (Subset of T);
assume (U is  open & p in U);
then consider V being (Subset of T) such that A3: V in B and A4: V c= U by YELLOW_8:def 1;
( V \ A ) <> ( {} ) by A2,A3;
then A5: ( U \ A ) <> ( {} ) by A4,XBOOLE_1:3,XBOOLE_1:33;
A meets V by A2,A3;
hence thesis by A4,A5,CKB2:1,XBOOLE_1:63;
end;
hence thesis by TOPS_1:28;
