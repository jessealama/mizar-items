theorem
Th24: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (for A being (Subset of T) holds (for p being (Point of T) holds (p is_isolated_in A iff (ex G being  open (Subset of T) st ( G /\ A ) = { p })))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
let A being (Subset of T);
let p being (Point of T);
hereby
assume A1: p is_isolated_in A;
then (not p is_an_accumulation_point_of A) by CKB30:def 1;
then consider U being  open (Subset of T) such that A2: p in U and A3: (not (ex q being (Point of T) st ((q <> p & q in A) & q in U))) by CKB32:1;
take U;
A4: p in A by A1,CKB30:def 1;
( U /\ A ) = { p }
proof
thus ( U /\ A ) c= { p }
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( U /\ A );
then (x in U & x in A) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then x = p by A3;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 1;
end;

let x being set;
assume x in { p };
then x = p by TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A4,A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
hence ( U /\ A ) = { p };
end;
given G being  open (Subset of T) such that
A5: ( G /\ A ) = { p };

A6: p in ( G /\ A ) by A5,TARSKI:def 1;
(ex U being  open (Subset of T) st (p in U & (not (ex q being (Point of T) st ((q <> p & q in A) & q in U)))))
proof
take G;
(for q being (Point of T) holds ((q = p or (not q in A)) or (not q in G)))
proof
given q being (Point of T) such that
A7: q <> p
and
A8: (q in A & q in G);

q in ( A /\ G ) by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by A5,A7,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
then A9: (not p is_an_accumulation_point_of A) by CKB32:1;
p in A by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by A9,CKB30:def 1;
end;
