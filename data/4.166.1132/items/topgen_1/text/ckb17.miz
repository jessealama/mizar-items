theorem
Th11: (for T being non empty TopSpace holds (for A being (Subset of T) holds (for p being (Point of T) holds (p in ( Fr A ) iff (for U being (Subset of T) holds ((U is  open & p in U) implies (A meets U & ( U \ A ) <> ( {} ))))))))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
let A being (Subset of T);
let p being (Point of T);
hereby
assume A1: p in ( Fr A );
let U being (Subset of T);
assume A2: (U is  open & p in U);
then U meets ( A ` ) by A1,TOPS_1:28;
hence (A meets U & ( U \ A ) <> ( {} )) by A1,A2,CKB2:1,TOPS_1:28;
end;
assume A3: (for U being (Subset of T) holds ((U is  open & p in U) implies (A meets U & ( U \ A ) <> ( {} ))));
(for U being (Subset of T) holds ((U is  open & p in U) implies (A meets U & U meets ( A ` ))))
proof
let U being (Subset of T);
assume A4: (U is  open & p in U);
then ( U \ A ) <> ( {} ) by A3;
hence thesis by A3,A4,CKB2:1;
end;
hence thesis by TOPS_1:28;
end;
