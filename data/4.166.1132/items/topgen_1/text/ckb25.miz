definition
let T being TopStruct;
let A being (Subset of T);
func Der A -> (Subset of T) means 
:Def3: (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of T) implies (x in it iff x is_an_accumulation_point_of A)));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
$1 is_an_accumulation_point_of A;
consider D being (Subset of T) such that A1: (for x being set holds (x in D iff (x in (the carrier of T) & P[ x ]))) from SUBSET_1:sch 1;
take D;
thus thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
$1 is_an_accumulation_point_of A;
let A1 being (Subset of T);
let A2 being (Subset of T);
assume that
A2: (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of T) implies (x in A1 iff P[ x ])))
and
A3: (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of T) implies (x in A2 iff P[ x ])));
A4: A2 c= A1
proof
let x being set;
assume A5: x in A2;
then P[ x ] by A3;
hence thesis by A2,A5;
end;
A1 c= A2
proof
let x being set;
assume A6: x in A1;
then P[ x ] by A2;
hence thesis by A3,A6;
end;
hence thesis by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
