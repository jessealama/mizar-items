theorem
Th23: (for T being non empty TopSpace holds (for A being (Subset of T) holds (for p being (Point of T) holds (p is_an_accumulation_point_of A iff (for U being  open (Subset of T) holds (p in U implies (ex q being (Point of T) st ((q <> p & q in A) & q in U))))))))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
let A being (Subset of T);
let p being (Point of T);
hereby
assume p is_an_accumulation_point_of A;
then A1: p in ( Der A ) by CKB26:1;
let U being  open (Subset of T);
assume p in U;
then consider q being (Point of T) such that A2: (q in ( A /\ U ) & p <> q) by A1,CKB27:1;
take q;
thus ((q <> p & q in A) & q in U) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
assume A3: (for U being  open (Subset of T) holds (p in U implies (ex q being (Point of T) st ((q <> p & q in A) & q in U))));
(for U being  open (Subset of T) holds (p in U implies (ex y being (Point of T) st (y in ( A /\ U ) & p <> y))))
proof
let U being  open (Subset of T);
assume p in U;
then consider q being (Point of T) such that A4: ((q <> p & q in A) & q in U) by A3;
take q;
thus thesis by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
then p in ( Der A ) by CKB27:1;
hence thesis by CKB26:1;
end;
