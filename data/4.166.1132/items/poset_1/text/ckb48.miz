func F -image p -> non  empty (Chain of Q) equals

correctness
proof
set R = (the InternalRel of Q);
set IT = { x where x is (Element of Q): (ex f being  continuous (Function of P,Q) st (f in F & x = ( f . p ))) };
(x in IT implies x in (the carrier of Q))
proof
assume x in IT;
then consider a being (Element of Q) such that A1: (x = a & (ex f being  continuous (Function of P,Q) st (f in F & a = ( f . p ))));
reconsider x as (Element of (the carrier of Q)) by A1;

proof
