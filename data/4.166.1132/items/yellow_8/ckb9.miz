theorem
Th18: (for T being TopStruct holds (for B being (Basis of T) holds (for V being (Subset of T) holds (V is  open implies V = ( union { G where G is (Subset of T): (G in B & G c= V) } )))))
proof
let T being TopStruct;
let B being (Basis of T);
let V being (Subset of T);
assume that
A1: V is  open;
set X = { G where G is (Subset of T): (G in B & G c= V) };
A2: (the topology of T) c= ( UniCl B ) by CANTOR_1:def 2;
(for x being set holds (x in V iff (ex Y being set st (x in Y & Y in X))))
proof
let x being set;
hereby
V in (the topology of T) by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then consider Y being (Subset-Family of T) such that A3: Y c= B and A4: V = ( union Y ) by A2,CANTOR_1:def 1;
assume x in V;
then consider W being set such that A5: x in W and A6: W in Y by A4,TARSKI:def 4;
take W;
thus x in W by A5;
reconsider G = W as (Subset of T) by A6;
G c= V by A4,A6,ZFMISC_1:74;
hence W in X by A3,A6;
end;
given Y being set such that
A7: x in Y
and
A8: Y in X;

(ex G being (Subset of T) st ((Y = G & G in B) & G c= V)) by A8;
hence thesis by A7;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 4;
end;
