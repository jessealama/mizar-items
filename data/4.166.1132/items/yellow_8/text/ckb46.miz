theorem
Th36: (for T being non empty TopSpace holds (T is  regular iff (for p being (Point of T) holds (for P being (Subset of T) holds (p in ( Int P ) implies (ex Q being (Subset of T) st ((Q is  closed & Q c= P) & p in ( Int Q ))))))))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
hereby
assume A1: T is  regular;
let p being (Point of T);
let P being (Subset of T);
assume p in ( Int P );
then A2: p in ( ( ( Int P ) ` ) ` );
per cases ;
suppose A3: P = ( [#] T );

take Q = ( [#] T );
thus Q is  closed;
thus Q c= P by A3;
( Int Q ) = Q by TOPS_1:15;
hence p in ( Int Q );
end;
suppose A4: P <> ( [#] T );

now
assume ( ( Int P ) ` ) = ( {} );
then ( ( ( Int P ) ` ) ` ) = ( [#] T );
then ( [#] T ) c= P by TOPS_1:16;
hence contradiction by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
then consider W being (Subset of T),V being (Subset of T) such that A5: W is  open and A6: V is  open and A7: p in W and A8: ( ( Int P ) ` ) c= V and A9: W misses V by A1,A2,COMPTS_1:def 2;
A10: ( Int P ) c= P by TOPS_1:16;
take Q = ( V ` );
thus Q is  closed by A6;
( ( Int P ) ` ) c= ( Q ` ) by A8;
then Q c= ( Int P ) by SUBSET_1:12;
hence Q c= P by A10,XBOOLE_1:1;
W c= Q by A9,SUBSET_1:23;
then W c= ( Int Q ) by A5,TOPS_1:24;
hence p in ( Int Q ) by A7;
end;
end;
assume A11: (for p being (Point of T) holds (for P being (Subset of T) holds (p in ( Int P ) implies (ex Q being (Subset of T) st ((Q is  closed & Q c= P) & p in ( Int Q ))))));
let p being (Point of T);
let P being (Subset of T);
assume that
P <> ( {} )
and
A12: (P is  closed & p in ( P ` ));
p in ( Int ( P ` ) ) by A12,TOPS_1:23;
then consider Q being (Subset of T) such that A13: Q is  closed and A14: Q c= ( P ` ) and A15: p in ( Int Q ) by A11;
reconsider W = ( Int Q ) as (Subset of T);
take W;
take V = ( Q ` );
thus W is  open;
thus V is  open by A13;
thus p in W by A15;
( ( P ` ) ` ) c= V by A14,SUBSET_1:12;
hence P c= V;
Q misses V by XBOOLE_1:79;
hence thesis by TOPS_1:16,XBOOLE_1:63;
end;
