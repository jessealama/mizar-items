theorem
(for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (T is  Baire iff (for F being (Subset-Family of T) holds ((F is  countable & (for S being (Subset of T) holds (S in F implies S is  nowhere_dense))) implies ( union F ) is  boundary))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
hereby
assume A1: T is  Baire;
let F being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A2: F is  countable
and
A3: (for S being (Subset of T) holds (S in F implies S is  nowhere_dense));
reconsider G = ( COMPLEMENT F ) as (Subset-Family of T);
A4: (for S being (Subset of T) holds (S in G implies S is  everywhere_dense))
proof
let S being (Subset of T);
assume S in G;
then ( S ` ) in F by SETFAM_1:def 7;
then ( S ` ) is  nowhere_dense by A3;
hence thesis by TOPS_3:39;
end;
G is  countable by A2,CKB3:1,CKB4:1;
then (ex I being (Subset of T) st (I = ( Intersect G ) & I is  dense)) by A1,A4,CKB18:def 1;
then ( ( union F ) ` ) is  dense by CKB6:1;
hence ( union F ) is  boundary by TOPS_1:def 4;
end;
assume A5: (for F being (Subset-Family of T) holds ((F is  countable & (for S being (Subset of T) holds (S in F implies S is  nowhere_dense))) implies ( union F ) is  boundary));
let F being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A6: F is  countable
and
A7: (for S being (Subset of T) holds (S in F implies S is  everywhere_dense));
reconsider I = ( Intersect F ) as (Subset of T);
take I;
thus I = ( Intersect F );
reconsider G = ( COMPLEMENT F ) as (Subset-Family of T);
A8: (for S being (Subset of T) holds (S in G implies S is  nowhere_dense))
proof
let S being (Subset of T);
assume S in G;
then ( S ` ) in F by SETFAM_1:def 7;
then ( S ` ) is  everywhere_dense by A7;
hence thesis by TOPS_3:40;
end;
G is  countable by A6,CKB3:1,CKB4:1;
then ( union G ) is  boundary by A5,A8;
then ( ( Intersect F ) ` ) is  boundary by CKB7:1;
hence thesis by TOPS_3:18;
end;
