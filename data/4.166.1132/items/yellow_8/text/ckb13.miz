let T being non  empty TopStruct;

existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
($1 in (the topology of T) & x in $1);
set IT = { S where S is (Subset of T): P[ S ] };
IT is (Subset-Family of T) from DOMAIN_1:sch 7;
then reconsider IT as (Subset-Family of T);
take IT;
IT c= (the topology of T)
proof
let e being set;
assume e in IT;
then (ex S being (Subset of T) st ((S = e & S in (the topology of T)) & x in S));
hence thesis;
end;
hence IT is  open by TOPS_2:64;
now
let e being set;
assume e in IT;
then (ex S being (Subset of T) st ((S = e & S in (the topology of T)) & x in S));
hence x in e;
end;
hence x in ( Intersect IT ) by SETFAM_1:43;
let S being (Subset of T);
assume that
A1: S is  open
and
A2: x in S;
take V = S;
V in (the topology of T) by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
hence V in IT by A2;
thus thesis;
end;
