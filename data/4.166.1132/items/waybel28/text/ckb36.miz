theorem
Th28: (for L being  complete LATTICE holds (for U1 being (Subset of L) holds (U1 in ( xi L ) implies U1 is  property(S))))
proof
let L being  complete LATTICE;
let U1 being (Subset of L);
assume U1 in ( xi L );
then U1 in { V where V is (Subset of L): (for p being (Element of L) holds (p in V implies (for N being (net of L) holds ([ N,p ] in ( lim_inf-Convergence L ) implies N is_eventually_in V)))) } by YELLOW_6:def 24;
then A1: (ex V being (Subset of L) st (U1 = V & (for p being (Element of L) holds (p in V implies (for N being (net of L) holds ([ N,p ] in ( lim_inf-Convergence L ) implies N is_eventually_in V))))));
let D being non  empty  directed (Subset of L);
assume A2: ( sup D ) in U1;
[ ( Net-Str D ),( sup D ) ] in ( lim_inf-Convergence L ) by CKB35:1;
then ( Net-Str D ) is_eventually_in U1 by A1,A2;
then consider y being (Element of ( Net-Str D )) such that A3: (for x being (Element of ( Net-Str D )) holds (y <= x implies ( ( Net-Str D ) . x ) in U1)) by WAYBEL_0:def 11;
A4: y in (the carrier of ( Net-Str D ));
then y in D by WAYBEL21:32;
then reconsider y1 = y as (Element of L);
reconsider y1 as (Element of L);
take y1;
thus y1 in D by A4,WAYBEL21:32;
let x1 being (Element of L);
assume that
A5: x1 in D
and
A6: x1 >= y1;
A7: ( Net-Str D ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of L) by WAYBEL21:32;
reconsider x = x1 as (Element of ( Net-Str D )) by A5,WAYBEL21:32;
reconsider x as (Element of ( Net-Str D ));
( ( Net-Str D ) . x ) = ( (the mapping of ( Net-Str D )) . x ) by WAYBEL_0:def 8
.= ( ( id D ) . x ) by WAYBEL21:32
.= x by A5,FUNCT_1:18;
hence thesis by A3,A6,A7,YELLOW_0:60;
