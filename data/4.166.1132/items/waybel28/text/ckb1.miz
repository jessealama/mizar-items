theorem
Th1: (for L being  complete LATTICE holds (for N being (net of L) holds ( inf N ) <= ( lim_inf N )))
proof
let L being  complete LATTICE;
let N being (net of L);
set X = { ( "/\" ({ ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= j1 },L) ) where j1 is (Element of N): (not contradiction) };
X c= (the carrier of L)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in X;
then (ex j1 being (Element of N) st x = ( "/\" ({ ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= j1 },L) ));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider X as (Subset of L);
set j = the (Element of N);
A1: { ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= j } c= ( rng (the mapping of N) )
proof
let x being set;
A2: ( dom (the mapping of N) ) = (the carrier of N) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
assume x in { ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= j };
then consider i being (Element of N) such that A3: x = ( N . i ) and i >= j;
x = ( (the mapping of N) . i ) by A3,WAYBEL_0:def 8;
hence thesis by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;
reconsider X as (Subset of L);
set x = ( "/\" ({ ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= j },L) );
( ex_inf_of { ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= j },L &  ex_inf_of ( rng (the mapping of N) ),L) by YELLOW_0:17;
then ( "/\" ({ ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= j },L) ) >= ( "/\" (( rng (the mapping of N) ),L) ) by A1,YELLOW_0:35;
then x >= ( Inf (the mapping of N) ) by YELLOW_2:def 6;
then A4: ( inf N ) <= x by WAYBEL_9:def 2;
 ex_sup_of X,L by YELLOW_0:17;
then (x in X & X is_<=_than ( "\/" (X,L) )) by YELLOW_0:def 9;
then x <= ( "\/" (X,L) ) by LATTICE3:def 9;
hence thesis by A4,YELLOW_0:def 2;
