theorem
Th22: (for L being non  empty 1-sorted holds (for C1,C2 being (Convergence-Class of L) holds (C1 c= C2 implies (the topology of ( ConvergenceSpace C2 )) c= (the topology of ( ConvergenceSpace C1 )))))
proof
let L being non  empty 1-sorted;
let C1 being (Convergence-Class of L);
let C2 being (Convergence-Class of L);
assume A1: C1 c= C2;
let A being set;
assume A in (the topology of ( ConvergenceSpace C2 ));
then A in { V where V is (Subset of L): (for p being (Element of L) holds (p in V implies (for N being (net of L) holds ([ N,p ] in C2 implies N is_eventually_in V)))) } by YELLOW_6:def 24;
then consider V1 being (Subset of L) such that A2: A = V1 and A3: (for p being (Element of L) holds (p in V1 implies (for N being (net of L) holds ([ N,p ] in C2 implies N is_eventually_in V1))));
(ex V being (Subset of L) st (A = V & (for p being (Element of L) holds (p in V implies (for N being (net of L) holds ([ N,p ] in C1 implies N is_eventually_in V))))))
proof
take V1;
thus A = V1 by A2;
let p being (Element of L);
assume A4: p in V1;
let N being (net of L);
assume [ N,p ] in C1;
hence thesis by A1,A3,A4;
end;
then A in { V where V is (Subset of L): (for p being (Element of L) holds (p in V implies (for N being (net of L) holds ([ N,p ] in C1 implies N is_eventually_in V)))) };
hence thesis by YELLOW_6:def 24;
end;
