theorem
(for L being non  empty 1-sorted holds (for N,M being (net of L) holds (( the NetStr of N ) = ( the NetStr of M ) implies M is (subnet of N))))
proof
let L being non  empty 1-sorted;
let N being (net of L);
let M being (net of L);
assume A1: ( the NetStr of N ) = ( the NetStr of M );
A2: N is (subnet of N) by YELLOW_6:14;
(ex f being (Function of M,N) st ((the mapping of M) = ( (the mapping of N) * f ) & (for m being (Element of N) holds (ex n being (Element of M) st (for p being (Element of M) holds (n <= p implies m <= ( f . p )))))))
proof
consider f being (Function of N,N) such that A3: (the mapping of N) = ( (the mapping of N) * f ) and A4: (for m being (Element of N) holds (ex n being (Element of N) st (for p being (Element of N) holds (n <= p implies m <= ( f . p ))))) by A2,YELLOW_6:def 9;
reconsider f2 = f as (Function of M,N) by A1;
take f2;
thus (the mapping of M) = ( (the mapping of N) * f2 ) by A1,A3;
let m being (Element of N);
consider n being (Element of N) such that A5: (for p being (Element of N) holds (n <= p implies m <= ( f . p ))) by A4;
reconsider n2 = n as (Element of M) by A1;
take n2;
let p being (Element of M);
reconsider p1 = p as (Element of N) by A1;
assume n2 <= p;
then [ n2,p ] in (the InternalRel of M) by ORDERS_2:def 5;
then n <= p1 by A1,ORDERS_2:def 5;
hence thesis by A5;
end;
hence thesis by YELLOW_6:def 9;
