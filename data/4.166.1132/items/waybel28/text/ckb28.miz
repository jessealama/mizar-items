theorem
(for L being  continuous  complete LATTICE holds ( lim_inf-Convergence L ) is  (DIVERGENCE))
proof
let L being  continuous  complete LATTICE;
let N being (net of L);
let x being (Element of L);
assume that
A1: N in ( NetUniv L )
and
A2: (not [ N,x ] in ( lim_inf-Convergence L ));
A3: (ex N1 being  strict (net of L) st (N1 = N & (the carrier of N1) in ( the_universe_of (the carrier of L) ))) by A1,YELLOW_6:def 11;
(not (for M being (subnet of N) holds x = ( lim_inf M ))) by A1,A2,CKB22:def 1;
then A4: (not (x = ( lim_inf N ) & (for p being  greater_or_equal_to_id (Function of N,N) holds x >= ( inf ( N * p ) )))) by CKB21:1;
A5: ( lim_inf-Convergence L ) c= [: ( NetUniv L ),(the carrier of L) :] by YELLOW_6:def 18;
per cases  by A1,A4,CKB16:1;
suppose A6: ((not x = ( lim_inf N )) & x <= ( lim_inf N ));

reconsider N9 = N as (subnet of N) by YELLOW_6:14;
take N9;
thus N9 in ( NetUniv L ) by A1;
given M2 being (subnet of N9) such that
A7: [ M2,x ] in ( lim_inf-Convergence L );

A8: ( lim_inf N ) <= ( lim_inf M2 ) by WAYBEL21:37;
A9: M2 is (subnet of M2) by YELLOW_6:14;
M2 in ( NetUniv L ) by A5,A7,ZFMISC_1:87;
then ( lim_inf M2 ) = x by A7,A9,CKB22:def 1;
hence contradiction by A6,A8,YELLOW_0:def 3;
end;
suppose ((not x = ( lim_inf N )) & (not x <= ( lim_inf N )));

then (not x is_S-limit_of N) by WAYBEL11:def 7;
then (not [ N,x ] in ( Scott-Convergence L )) by A1,A3,WAYBEL11:def 8;
then consider M being (subnet of N) such that A10: M in ( NetUniv L ) and A11: (not (ex M1 being (subnet of M) st [ M1,x ] in ( Scott-Convergence L ))) by A1,YELLOW_6:def 22;
take M;
thus M in ( NetUniv L ) by A10;
(for M1 being (subnet of M) holds (not [ M1,x ] in ( lim_inf-Convergence L )))
proof
let M1 being (subnet of M);
A12: (not [ M1,x ] in ( Scott-Convergence L )) by A11;
assume A13: [ M1,x ] in ( lim_inf-Convergence L );
then A14: M1 in ( NetUniv L ) by A5,ZFMISC_1:87;
then (ex M11 being  strict (net of L) st (M11 = M1 & (the carrier of M11) in ( the_universe_of (the carrier of L) ))) by YELLOW_6:def 11;
then A15: (not x is_S-limit_of M1) by A14,A12,WAYBEL11:def 8;
M1 is (subnet of M1) by YELLOW_6:14;
then x = ( lim_inf M1 ) by A13,A14,CKB22:def 1;
hence contradiction by A15,WAYBEL11:def 7;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
suppose (not (for M being (subnet of N) holds (M in ( NetUniv L ) implies x >= ( inf M ))));

then consider M being (subnet of N) such that A16: M in ( NetUniv L ) and A17: (not x >= ( inf M ));
take M;
thus M in ( NetUniv L ) by A16;
(for M1 being (subnet of M) holds (not [ M1,x ] in ( lim_inf-Convergence L )))
proof
let M1 being (subnet of M);
A18: M1 is (subnet of M1) by YELLOW_6:14;
A19: (( lim_inf M1 ) >= ( lim_inf M ) & ( lim_inf M ) >= ( inf M )) by CKB1:1,WAYBEL21:37;
assume A20: [ M1,x ] in ( lim_inf-Convergence L );
then M1 in ( NetUniv L ) by A5,ZFMISC_1:87;
then x = ( lim_inf M1 ) by A20,A18,CKB22:def 1;
hence contradiction by A17,A19,YELLOW_0:def 2;
end;
hence thesis;
