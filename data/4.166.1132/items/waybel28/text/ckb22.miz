let L being non empty RelStr;
func lim_inf-Convergence L -> (Convergence-Class of L)
means
:Def3: (for N being (net of L) holds (N in ( NetUniv L ) implies (for x being (Element of L) holds ([ N,x ] in it iff (for M being (subnet of N) holds x = ( lim_inf M ))))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(ex N being  strict (net of L) st ($1 = N & (for M being (subnet of N) holds $2 = ( lim_inf M ))));
consider C being (Relation of ( NetUniv L ),(the carrier of L)) such that A1: (for N9 being (Element of ( NetUniv L )) holds (for x being (Element of L) holds ([ N9,x ] in C iff P[ N9,x ]))) from RELSET_1:sch 2;
reconsider C as (Convergence-Class of L) by YELLOW_6:def 18;
take C;
let N being (net of L);
assume N in ( NetUniv L );
then reconsider N1 = N as (Element of ( NetUniv L ));
let x being (Element of L);
thus ([ N,x ] in C implies (for M being (subnet of N) holds x = ( lim_inf M )))
proof
assume A2: [ N,x ] in C;
let M being (subnet of N);
(ex N2 being  strict (net of L) st (N1 = N2 & (for M being (subnet of N2) holds x = ( lim_inf M )))) by A1,A2;

let Ns being set,xs being set;
A6: C1 c= [: ( NetUniv L ),(the carrier of L) :] by YELLOW_6:def 18;
thus ([ Ns,xs ] in C1 implies [ Ns,xs ] in C2)
proof
assume A7: [ Ns,xs ] in C1;
then reconsider x = xs as (Element of L) by A6,ZFMISC_1:87;
Ns in ( NetUniv L ) by A6,A7,ZFMISC_1:87;
