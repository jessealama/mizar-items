theorem
Th26: (for L being  complete LATTICE holds (for D being  directed non  empty (Subset of L) holds (for M being (subnet of ( Net-Str D )) holds ( lim_inf M ) = ( sup D ))))
proof
let L being  complete LATTICE;
let D being  directed non  empty (Subset of L);
(for M being (subnet of ( Net-Str D )) holds ( sup D ) >= ( inf M ))
proof
let M being (subnet of ( Net-Str D ));
set i = the (Element of M);
set f = (the mapping of M);
consider g being (Function of M,( Net-Str D )) such that A1: (the mapping of M) = ( (the mapping of ( Net-Str D )) * g ) and (for m being (Element of ( Net-Str D )) holds (ex n being (Element of M) st (for p being (Element of M) holds (n <= p implies m <= ( g . p ))))) by YELLOW_6:def 9;

then ( f . i ) in ( rng f ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
then A3: ( "/\" (( rng f ),L) ) <= ( f . i ) by YELLOW_0:17,YELLOW_4:2;

then A4: ( g . i ) in D by WAYBEL21:32;
then ( g . i ) = ( ( id D ) . ( g . i ) ) by FUNCT_1:18
.= ( (the mapping of ( Net-Str D )) . ( g . i ) ) by WAYBEL21:32
.= ( f . i ) by A1,A2,FUNCT_1:12;
then ( f . i ) <= ( sup D ) by A4,YELLOW_2:22;
then ( sup D ) >= ( "/\" (( rng f ),L) ) by A3,YELLOW_0:def 2;
then ( sup D ) >= ( Inf (the mapping of M) ) by YELLOW_2:def 6;
