theorem
(for L being  complete LATTICE holds (for A being (Subset of L) holds (A is  lower implies (( A ` ) in ( xi L ) iff A is  closed_under_directed_sups))))
proof
let L being  complete LATTICE;
let A being (Subset of L);
set T = the  Scott (TopAugmentation of L);
assume A1: A is  lower;
then reconsider A1 = A as  lower (Subset of L);
A2: ( the RelStr of L ) = ( the RelStr of T ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
then reconsider A9 = A as (Subset of T);
reconsider A9 as (Subset of T);
A3: ( A1 ` ) is  upper;
thus (( A ` ) in ( xi L ) implies A is  closed_under_directed_sups)
proof
assume ( A ` ) in ( xi L );
then ( A9 ` ) in ( sigma L ) by A3,A2,CKB38:1;
then ( A9 ` ) in (the topology of T) by YELLOW_9:51;
then ( A9 ` ) is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then A9 is  closed by TOPS_1:3;
then A9 is  directly_closed by WAYBEL11:7;
hence thesis by A2,YELLOW12:20;
end;

assume A is  closed_under_directed_sups;
then A4: A9 is  directly_closed by A2,YELLOW12:20;
A9 is  lower by A1,A2,WAYBEL_0:25;
then A9 is  closed by A4,WAYBEL11:7;
then ( A9 ` ) is  open by TOPS_1:3;
then ( A9 ` ) in (the topology of T) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then ( A ` ) in ( sigma L ) by A2,YELLOW_9:51;
hence thesis by CKB37:1;
end;
