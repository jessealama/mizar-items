theorem
Th13: (for L being non empty 1-sorted holds (for N being (net of L) holds (for p being  greater_or_equal_to_id (Function of N,N) holds ( N * p ) is (subnet of N))))
proof
let L being non empty 1-sorted;
let N being (net of L);
let p being  greater_or_equal_to_id (Function of N,N);
(ex f being (Function of ( N * p ),N) st ((the mapping of ( N * p )) = ( (the mapping of N) * f ) & (for m being (Element of N) holds (ex n being (Element of ( N * p )) st (for k being (Element of ( N * p )) holds (n <= k implies m <= ( f . k )))))))
proof
(the carrier of ( N * p )) = (the carrier of N) by CKB10:1;
then reconsider f = p as (Function of ( N * p ),N);
take f;
thus (the mapping of ( N * p )) = ( (the mapping of N) * f ) by CKB9:def 1;
let m being (Element of N);
reconsider n = m as (Element of ( N * p )) by CKB10:1;
take n;
let k being (Element of ( N * p ));
assume A1: n <= k;
reconsider k1 = k as (Element of N) by CKB10:1;
A2: k1 <= ( p . k1 ) by CKB4:def 1;
( the RelStr of ( N * p ) ) = ( the RelStr of N ) by CKB9:def 1;
then m <= k1 by A1,YELLOW_0:1;
hence thesis by A2,YELLOW_0:def 2;
end;
hence thesis by YELLOW_6:def 9;
