theorem
Lm1: ((x <= y & y <= x) implies x = y)
proof
assume that
A1: x <= y
and
A2: y <= x;
A3: (x in ( REAL ) & y in ( REAL )) by XREAL_0:def 1;
per cases  by A3,NUMBERS:def 1,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose (x in ( REAL+ ) & y in ( REAL+ ));

then ((ex x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = x9 & y = y9) & x9 <=' y9)) & (ex y99,x99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((y = y99 & x = x99) & y99 <=' x99))) by A1,A2,XXREAL_0:def 5;
hence thesis by ARYTM_1:4;
end;
suppose A4: (x in ( REAL+ ) & y in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]);

then ((not (x in ( REAL+ ) & y in ( REAL+ ))) & (not (x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & y in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))) by ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A1,A4,XXREAL_0:def 5;
end;
suppose A5: (y in ( REAL+ ) & x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]);

then ((not (x in ( REAL+ ) & y in ( REAL+ ))) & (not (x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & y in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))) by ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A2,A5,XXREAL_0:def 5;
end;
suppose that A6: (x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & y in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]);
consider x9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )),y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A7: (x = [ ( 0 ),x9 ] & y = [ ( 0 ),y9 ]) and A8: y9 <=' x9 by A1,A6,XXREAL_0:def 5;
consider y99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )),x99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A9: (y = [ ( 0 ),y99 ] & x = [ ( 0 ),x99 ]) and A10: x99 <=' y99 by A2,A6,XXREAL_0:def 5;
(x9 = x99 & y9 = y99) by A7,A9,ZFMISC_1:27;
hence thesis by A8,A9,A10,ARYTM_1:4;
