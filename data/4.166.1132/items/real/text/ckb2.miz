theorem
Lm2: ((x <= y & y <= z) implies x <= z)
proof
assume that
A1: x <= y
and
A2: y <= z;
A3: (x in ( REAL ) & y in ( REAL )) by XREAL_0:def 1;
A4: z in ( REAL ) by XREAL_0:def 1;
per cases  by A3,A4,NUMBERS:def 1,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose that A5: x in ( REAL+ )
and
A6: y in ( REAL+ )
and
A7: z in ( REAL+ );
consider y99,z9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A8: y = y99 and A9: z = z9 and A10: y99 <=' z9 by A2,A6,A7,XXREAL_0:def 5;
consider x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A11: x = x9 and A12: (y = y9 & x9 <=' y9) by A1,A5,A6,XXREAL_0:def 5;
x9 <=' z9 by A12,A8,A10,ARYTM_1:3;
hence thesis by A11,A9,XXREAL_0:def 5;
end;
suppose A13: (x in ( REAL+ ) & y in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]);

then ((not (x in ( REAL+ ) & y in ( REAL+ ))) & (not (x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & y in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))) by ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A1,A13,XXREAL_0:def 5;
end;
suppose A14: (y in ( REAL+ ) & z in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]);

then ((not (z in ( REAL+ ) & y in ( REAL+ ))) & (not (z in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & y in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))) by ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A2,A14,XXREAL_0:def 5;
end;
suppose that A15: x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]
and
A16: z in ( REAL+ );
((not (x in ( REAL+ ) & z in ( REAL+ ))) & (not (x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & z in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))) by A15,A16,ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A16,XXREAL_0:def 5;
end;
suppose that A17: x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]
and
A18: y in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]
and
A19: z in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :];
consider y99,z9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A20: y = [ ( 0 ),y99 ] and A21: z = [ ( 0 ),z9 ] and A22: z9 <=' y99 by A2,A18,A19,XXREAL_0:def 5;
consider x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A23: x = [ ( 0 ),x9 ] and A24: y = [ ( 0 ),y9 ] and A25: y9 <=' x9 by A1,A17,A18,XXREAL_0:def 5;
y9 = y99 by A24,A20,ZFMISC_1:27;
then z9 <=' x9 by A25,A22,ARYTM_1:3;
hence thesis by A17,A19,A23,A21,XXREAL_0:def 5;
end;
