theorem
Th27: (V = X implies (V is  co-prime iff X is  filtered  upper))
proof
assume A1: V = X;
A2: ( the TopStruct of L ) = ( ConvergenceSpace ( Scott-Convergence L ) ) by WAYBEL11:32;
A3: ( sigma L ) = (the topology of ( ConvergenceSpace ( Scott-Convergence L ) )) by WAYBEL11:def 12;
A4: (the carrier of ( InclPoset ( sigma L ) )) = ( sigma L ) by YELLOW_1:1;
then A5: X is  upper by A1,A3,WAYBEL11:31;
hereby
assume A6: V is  co-prime;
thus X is  filtered
proof
let v being (Element of L),w being (Element of L);
assume that
A7: v in X
and
A8: w in X;
(( ( downarrow w ) ` ) is  open & ( ( downarrow v ) ` ) is  open) by WAYBEL11:12;

w <= w;
then w in ( downarrow w ) by WAYBEL_0:17;
then (not V c= ( ( downarrow w ) ` )) by A1,A8,XBOOLE_0:def 5;

v <= v;
then v in ( downarrow v ) by WAYBEL_0:17;
then (not V c= ( ( downarrow v ) ` )) by A1,A7,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then (not V <= mdv) by YELLOW_1:3;
then (not V <= ( mdv "\/" mdw )) by A3,A6,A9,CKB15:1;

( mdv \/ mdw ) c= ( mdv "\/" mdw ) by A3,YELLOW_1:6;
then (not V c= ( mdv \/ mdw )) by A10,XBOOLE_1:1;
then X meets ( ( ( downarrow ( v "/\" w ) ) ` ) ` ) by A1,A11,SUBSET_1:24;
then ( X /\ ( ( ( downarrow ( v "/\" w ) ) ` ) ` ) ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then consider zz being set such that A12: zz in ( X /\ ( downarrow ( v "/\" w ) ) ) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
A13: zz in ( downarrow ( v "/\" w ) ) by A12,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A14: zz in X by A12,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
reconsider zz as (Element of L) by A12;
zz <= ( v "/\" w ) by A13,WAYBEL_0:17;
hence z in X by A5,A14,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
thus (z <= v & z <= w) by YELLOW_0:23;
end;

thus X is  upper by A1,A3,A4,WAYBEL11:31;
end;
assume A15: X is  filtered  upper;
assume (not V is  co-prime);

(Xx in ( sigma L ) & Y in ( sigma L )) by A4;
then reconsider Xx9 = Xx,Y9 = Y as (Subset of L);
A19: Y9 is  open by A3,A4,A2,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then A20: Y9 is  upper by WAYBEL11:def 4;
A21: Xx9 is  open by A3,A4,A2,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then ( Xx9 \/ Y9 ) is  open by A19;
then ( Xx \/ Y ) in ( sigma L ) by A3,A2,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then ( Xx \/ Y ) = ( Xx "\/" Y ) by YELLOW_1:8;
then A22: V c= ( Xx \/ Y ) by A16,YELLOW_1:3;
(not V c= Y) by A18,YELLOW_1:3;
then consider w being set such that A23: w in V and A24: (not w in Y) by TARSKI:def 3;
(not V c= Xx) by A17,YELLOW_1:3;
then consider v being set such that A25: v in V and A26: (not v in Xx) by TARSKI:def 3;
reconsider v,w as (Element of L) by A1,A25,A23;
A27: Xx9 is  upper by A21,WAYBEL11:def 4;
A28:now
assume A29: ( v "/\" w ) in ( Xx9 \/ Y9 );
per cases  by A29,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A30: ( v "/\" w ) in Xx9;

( v "/\" w ) <= v by YELLOW_0:23;
hence contradiction by A26,A27,A30,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
end;
suppose A31: ( v "/\" w ) in Y9;

( v "/\" w ) <= w by YELLOW_0:23;
hence contradiction by A24,A20,A31,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
end;
end;
( v "/\" w ) in X by A1,A15,A25,A23,WAYBEL_0:41;
hence contradiction by A1,A22,A28;
