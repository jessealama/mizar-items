theorem
Th1: (for X being set holds (for F being  finite (Subset-Family of X) holds (ex G being  finite (Subset-Family of X) st ((G c= F & ( union G ) = ( union F )) & (for g being (Subset of X) holds (g in G implies (not g c= ( union ( G \ { g } ) ))))))))
proof
let X being set;
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
(for F being  finite (Subset-Family of X) holds (( card F ) = $1 implies (ex G being  finite (Subset-Family of X) st ((G c= F & ( union G ) = ( union F )) & (for g being (Subset of X) holds (g in G implies (not g c= ( union ( G \ { g } ) ))))))));

thus P[ ( n + 1 ) ]
proof
let F being  finite (Subset-Family of X);

per cases ;
suppose (ex g being (Subset of X) st (g in F & g c= ( union ( F \ { g } ) )));

then consider g being (Subset of X) such that A4: g in F and A5: g c= ( union ( F \ { g } ) );
reconsider FF = ( F \ { g } ) as  finite (Subset-Family of X);
{ g } c= F by A4,ZFMISC_1:31;
then A6: F = ( FF \/ { g } ) by XBOOLE_1:45;
A7: ( union F ) c= ( union FF )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( union F );
then consider X being set such that A8: x in X and A9: X in F by TARSKI:def 4;
per cases  by A6,A9,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose X in FF;

then X c= ( union FF ) by ZFMISC_1:74;
hence thesis by A8;

suppose X in { g };

then X = g by TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A5,A8;

FF c= F by A6,XBOOLE_1:7;
hence G c= F by A10,XBOOLE_1:1;
( union FF ) c= ( union F ) by A6,XBOOLE_1:7,ZFMISC_1:77;
hence ( union G ) = ( union F ) by A11,A7,XBOOLE_0:def 10;

suppose A13: (not (ex g being (Subset of X) st (g in F & g c= ( union ( F \ { g } ) ))));

take G = F;

proof
let F being  finite (Subset-Family of X);

take G = F;
