reserve L for  complete  Scott TopLattice;
reserve x for (Element of L);
reserve V for (Element of ( InclPoset ( sigma L ) ));
theorem
Lm2: (for L being  complete  Scott TopLattice holds (for V being  filtered (Subset of L) holds (for F being (Subset-Family of L) holds (for CF being (Subset of ( InclPoset ( sigma L ) )) holds ((F = { ( downarrow u ) where u is (Element of L): u in V } & CF = ( COMPLEMENT F )) implies CF is  directed)))))
proof
let L being  complete  Scott TopLattice;
let V being  filtered (Subset of L);
let F being (Subset-Family of L);
let CF being (Subset of ( InclPoset ( sigma L ) ));
assume that
A1: F = { ( downarrow u ) where u is (Element of L): u in V }
and
A2: CF = ( COMPLEMENT F );
set IPs = ( InclPoset ( sigma L ) );
let x being (Element of IPs);
let y being (Element of IPs);
assume that
A3: x in CF
and
A4: y in CF;
A5: ( sigma L ) = (the topology of L) by CKB27:1;
then A6: (the carrier of IPs) = (the topology of L) by YELLOW_1:1;
then (x in ( sigma L ) & y in ( sigma L )) by A5;
then reconsider x9 = x,y9 = y as (Subset of L);
( x9 ` ) in F by A2,A3,SETFAM_1:def 7;
then consider ux being (Element of L) such that A7: ( x9 ` ) = ( downarrow ux ) and A8: ux in V by A1;
( y9 ` ) in F by A2,A4,SETFAM_1:def 7;
then consider uy being (Element of L) such that A9: ( y9 ` ) = ( downarrow uy ) and A10: uy in V by A1;
consider uz being (Element of L) such that A11: uz in V and A12: uz <= ux and A13: uz <= uy by A8,A10,WAYBEL_0:def 2;
( ( downarrow uz ) ` ) is  open by WAYBEL11:12;
then reconsider z = ( ( downarrow uz ) ` ) as (Element of IPs) by A6,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
take z;
( downarrow uz ) in F by A1,A11;
hence z in CF by A2,YELLOW_8:5;
( downarrow uz ) c= ( downarrow uy ) by A13,WAYBEL_0:21;
then A14: ( ( downarrow uy ) ` ) c= ( ( downarrow uz ) ` ) by SUBSET_1:12;
( downarrow uz ) c= ( downarrow ux ) by A12,WAYBEL_0:21;
then ( ( downarrow ux ) ` ) c= ( ( downarrow uz ) ` ) by SUBSET_1:12;
hence (x <= z & y <= z) by A7,A9,A14,YELLOW_1:3;
