begin
reserve L for  complete  Scott TopLattice;
reserve x for (Element of L);
reserve X for (Subset of L);
reserve V for (Element of ( InclPoset ( sigma L ) ));
theorem
(L is  continuous implies ( InclPoset ( sigma L ) ) is  continuous)
proof
assume A1: L is  continuous;
set IPs = ( InclPoset (the topology of L) );
A2: (the carrier of IPs) = (the topology of L) by YELLOW_1:1;
A3: ( sigma L ) = (the topology of L) by CKB27:1;
IPs is  satisfying_axiom_of_approximation
proof
let V being (Element of IPs);
set VV = { ( wayabove x ) where x is (Element of L): x in V };
set wV = ( waybelow V );
V in ( sigma L ) by A3,A2;
then A4: V = ( union VV ) by A1,CKB39:1;
now
let x being set;
hereby
assume x in V;
then consider xU being set such that A5: x in xU and A6: xU in VV by A4,TARSKI:def 4;
consider y being (Element of L) such that A7: xU = ( wayabove y ) and A8: y in V by A6;
( wayabove y ) is  open by A1,WAYBEL11:36;
then reconsider xU as (Element of IPs) by A2,A7,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
xU << V
proof
let D being non  empty  directed (Subset of IPs);
assume V <= ( sup D );
then V c= ( sup D ) by YELLOW_1:3;
then V c= ( union D ) by YELLOW_1:22;
then consider DD being set such that A9: y in DD and A10: DD in D by A8,TARSKI:def 4;
DD in ( sigma L ) by A3,A2,A10;
then reconsider DD as (Subset of L);
DD is  open by A2,A10,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then DD is  upper by WAYBEL11:def 4;
then A11: ( uparrow y ) c= DD by A9,WAYBEL11:42;
reconsider d = DD as (Element of IPs) by A10;
take d;
thus d in D by A10;
( wayabove y ) c= ( uparrow y ) by WAYBEL_3:11;
then ( wayabove y ) c= DD by A11,XBOOLE_1:1;
hence thesis by A7,YELLOW_1:3;
end;
then xU in wV;
hence x in ( union wV ) by A5,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
assume x in ( union wV );
then consider X being set such that A12: x in X and A13: X in wV by TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider X as (Element of IPs) by A13;
X << V by A13,WAYBEL_3:7;
then X <= V by WAYBEL_3:1;
then X c= V by YELLOW_1:3;
hence x in V by A12;
end;
then V = ( union ( waybelow V ) ) by TARSKI:1;
hence thesis by YELLOW_1:22;
end;
hence thesis by CKB27:1;
