theorem
Th15: (for P being  complete non empty Poset holds (for V being non empty (Subset of P) holds ( downarrow ( inf V ) ) = ( meet { ( downarrow u ) where u is (Element of P): u in V } )))
proof
let P being  complete non empty Poset;
let V being non empty (Subset of P);
set F = { ( downarrow u ) where u is (Element of P): u in V };
consider u being set such that A1: u in V by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
A2: F c= ( bool (the carrier of P) )
proof
let X being set;
assume X in F;
then (ex u being (Element of P) st (X = ( downarrow u ) & u in V));
hence thesis;
end;
reconsider u as (Element of P) by A1;
A3: ( downarrow u ) in F by A1;
reconsider F as (Subset-Family of P) by A2;
reconsider F as (Subset-Family of P);
now
let x being set;
hereby
assume A4: x in ( downarrow ( inf V ) );
then reconsider d = x as (Element of P);
A5: d <= ( inf V ) by A4,WAYBEL_0:17;
now
let Y being set;
assume Y in F;
then consider u being (Element of P) such that A6: Y = ( downarrow u ) and A7: u in V;
( inf V ) is_<=_than V by YELLOW_0:33;
then ( inf V ) <= u by A7,LATTICE3:def 8;
then d <= u by A5,ORDERS_2:3;
hence x in Y by A6,WAYBEL_0:17;
end;
hence x in ( meet F ) by A3,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
assume A8: x in ( meet F );
then reconsider d = x as (Element of P);
now
let b being (Element of P);
assume b in V;
then ( downarrow b ) in F;
then d in ( downarrow b ) by A8,SETFAM_1:def 1;
hence d <= b by WAYBEL_0:17;
end;
then d is_<=_than V by LATTICE3:def 8;
then d <= ( inf V ) by YELLOW_0:33;
hence x in ( downarrow ( inf V ) ) by WAYBEL_0:17;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
end;
