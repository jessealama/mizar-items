theorem
Th17: (for T being non empty TopSpace holds (for S being  irreducible (Subset of T) holds (for V being (Element of ( InclPoset (the topology of T) )) holds (V = ( S ` ) implies V is  prime))))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
let S being  irreducible (Subset of T);
let V being (Element of ( InclPoset (the topology of T) ));
assume that
A1: V = ( S ` );
set sL = (the topology of T);
let X being (Element of ( InclPoset sL )),Y being (Element of ( InclPoset sL ));
A2: (the carrier of ( InclPoset (the topology of T) )) = (the topology of T) by YELLOW_1:1;
then (X in sL & Y in sL);
then reconsider X9 = X,Y9 = Y as (Subset of T);
( X9 /\ Y9 ) in sL by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 1;
then A3: ( X /\ Y ) = ( X "/\" Y ) by YELLOW_1:9;
assume ( X "/\" Y ) <= V;
then ( X /\ Y ) c= V by A3,YELLOW_1:3;
then S c= ( ( X9 /\ Y9 ) ` ) by A1,CKB2:1;
then S c= ( ( X9 ` ) \/ ( Y9 ` ) ) by XBOOLE_1:54;
then S = ( ( ( X9 ` ) \/ ( Y9 ` ) ) /\ S ) by XBOOLE_1:28;
then A4: S = ( ( ( X9 ` ) /\ S ) \/ ( ( Y9 ` ) /\ S ) ) by XBOOLE_1:23;
A5: S is  closed by YELLOW_8:def 3;
Y9 is  open by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then ( Y9 ` ) is  closed;
then A6: ( ( Y9 ` ) /\ S ) is  closed by A5;
X9 is  open by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then ( X9 ` ) is  closed;
then ( ( X9 ` ) /\ S ) is  closed by A5;
then (S = ( ( X9 ` ) /\ S ) or S = ( ( Y9 ` ) /\ S )) by A6,A4,YELLOW_8:def 3;
then (S c= ( X9 ` ) or S c= ( Y9 ` )) by XBOOLE_1:17;
then (X c= V or Y c= V) by A1,CKB2:1;
hence (X <= V or Y <= V) by YELLOW_1:3;
end;
