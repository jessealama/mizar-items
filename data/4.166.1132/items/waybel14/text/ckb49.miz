theorem
((ex B being (Basis of L) st B = { ( uparrow x ): x in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) }) implies (( InclPoset ( sigma L ) ) is  algebraic & (for V holds (ex VV st (V = ( sup VV ) & (for W holds (W in VV implies W is  co-prime)))))))
proof
given B being (Basis of L) such that
A1: B = { ( uparrow k ) where k is (Element of L): k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) };

set IPs = ( InclPoset ( sigma L ) );
set IPt = ( InclPoset (the topology of L) );
A2: (the carrier of IPs) = ( sigma L ) by YELLOW_1:1;
A3: ( sigma L ) = (the topology of L) by CKB27:1;
A4: IPs = IPt by CKB27:1;
thus ( InclPoset ( sigma L ) ) is  algebraic
proof
thus (for X being (Element of IPs) holds ( compactbelow X ) is non empty  directed) by A3;
thus IPs is  up-complete by A4;
let X being (Element of IPs);
set cX = ( compactbelow X );
set GB = { G where G is (Subset of L): (G in B & G c= X) };
X in ( sigma L ) by A2;
then reconsider X9 = X as (Subset of L);
X9 is  open by A2,CKB28:1;
then A5: X = ( union GB ) by YELLOW_8:9;
A6:now
let x being set;
hereby
assume x in X;
then consider GG being set such that A7: x in GG and A8: GG in GB by A5,TARSKI:def 4;
consider G being (Subset of L) such that A9: G = GG and A10: G in B and A11: G c= X by A8;
consider k being (Element of L) such that A12: G = ( uparrow k ) and A13: k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) by A1,A10;
k is  compact by A13,WAYBEL_8:def 1;
then ( uparrow k ) is  Open by WAYBEL_8:2;
then ( uparrow k ) is  open by WAYBEL11:41;
then reconsider G as (Element of IPs) by A3,A2,A12,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
(for X being (Subset of L) holds (X is  open implies X is  upper)) by WAYBEL11:def 4;
then ( uparrow k ) is  compact by CKB25:1;
then A14: G is  compact by A3,A12,WAYBEL_3:36;
G <= X by A11,YELLOW_1:3;
then G in cX by A14;
hence x in ( union cX ) by A7,A9,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
assume x in ( union cX );
then consider G being set such that A15: x in G and A16: G in cX by TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider G as (Element of IPs) by A16;
G <= X by A16,WAYBEL_8:4;
then G c= X by YELLOW_1:3;
hence x in X by A15;
end;
( sup cX ) = ( union cX ) by A3,YELLOW_1:22;
hence thesis by A6,TARSKI:1;
end;

let V being (Element of ( InclPoset ( sigma L ) ));
V in ( sigma L ) by A2;
then reconsider V9 = V as (Subset of L);
set GB = { G where G is (Subset of L): (G in B & G c= V) };
GB c= (the carrier of IPs)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in GB;
then consider G being (Subset of L) such that A17: G = x and A18: G in B and G c= V;
G is  open by A18,YELLOW_8:10;
hence thesis by A2,A17,CKB28:1;
end;
then reconsider GB as (Subset of ( InclPoset ( sigma L ) ));
take GB;
V9 is  open by A2,CKB28:1;
then V = ( union GB ) by YELLOW_8:9;
hence V = ( sup GB ) by A3,YELLOW_1:22;
let x being (Element of ( InclPoset ( sigma L ) ));
assume x in GB;
then consider G being (Subset of L) such that A19: G = x and A20: G in B and G c= V;
(ex k being (Element of L) st (G = ( uparrow k ) & k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )))) by A1,A20;
hence thesis by A19,CKB33:1;
