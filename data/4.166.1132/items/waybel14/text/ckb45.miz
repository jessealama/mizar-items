theorem
Th39: ((for x holds (ex B being (Basis of x) st (for Y holds (Y in B implies Y is  open  filtered)))) iff (for V holds (ex VV st (V = ( sup VV ) & (for W holds (W in VV implies W is  co-prime))))))
proof
set IPs = ( InclPoset (the topology of L) );
A1: ( sigma L ) = (the topology of L) by CKB27:1;
then A2: (the carrier of IPs) = ( sigma L ) by YELLOW_1:1;
hereby
assume A3: (for x being (Element of L) holds (ex X being (Basis of x) st (for Y being (Subset of L) holds (Y in X implies Y is  open  filtered))));

Y is  open by A5;
then Y in ( sigma L ) by CKB28:1;
hence YY in (the carrier of ( InclPoset ( sigma L ) )) by A4,YELLOW_1:1;

then reconsider X as (Subset of ( InclPoset ( sigma L ) )) by TARSKI:def 3;
