theorem
Lm6: (for A being (Subset of Tf) holds (( Tf | A ) is  finite-ind & ( ind ( Tf | A ) ) <= ( ind Tf )))
proof
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
(for T holds ((T is  finite-ind & ( ind T ) = ( $1 - 1 )) implies (for A being (Subset of T) holds (( T | A ) is  finite-ind & ( ind ( T | A ) ) <= ( ind T )))));
( [#] Tf ) is  finite-ind by CKB16:def 1;
then reconsider i = ( ( ind Tf ) + 1 ) as Nat by CKB25:1;
A1: (for k being Nat holds ((for n holds (n < k implies P[ n ])) implies P[ k ]))
proof
