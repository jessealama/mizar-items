theorem
Th3: (for F holds (F = B implies (F in ( ( Seq_of_ind ( T | A ) ) . n ) iff B in ( ( Seq_of_ind T ) . n ))))
proof
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
(for F being (Subset of ( T | A )) holds (for B holds (F = B implies (F in ( ( Seq_of_ind ( T | A ) ) . $1 ) iff B in ( ( Seq_of_ind T ) . $1 )))));
A1: (for n holds (P[ n ] implies P[ ( n + 1 ) ]))
proof
set TA = ( T | A );
let n;
assume that
A2: P[ n ];
set n1 = ( n + 1 );
let F being (Subset of TA);
let B;
assume that
A3: F = B;
set TAF = ( ( T | A ) | F );
set TB = ( T | B );
A4: TAF = TB by A3,METRIZTS:9;

hereby
assume A6: F in ( ( Seq_of_ind TA ) . n1 );
per cases  by A6,CKB3:def 1;
suppose F in ( ( Seq_of_ind TA ) . n );

then B in ( ( Seq_of_ind T ) . n ) by A2,A3;
hence B in ( ( Seq_of_ind T ) . n1 ) by CKB3:def 1;
end;
suppose A7: (for p being (Point of TAF) holds (for U being  open (Subset of TAF) holds (p in U implies (ex W being  open (Subset of TAF) st ((p in W & W c= U) & ( Fr W ) in ( ( Seq_of_ind TA ) . n ))))));

reconsider W = W9 as  open (Subset of TB) by A4;
take W;
( Fr W ) is (Subset of T) by A5,XBOOLE_1:1;
hence ((p in W & W c= U) & ( Fr W ) in ( ( Seq_of_ind T ) . n )) by A2,A4,A9;
end;
hence B in ( ( Seq_of_ind T ) . n1 ) by CKB3:def 1;

now
let p being (Point of TAF);

assume that
A13: p in U;
reconsider U9 = U as  open (Subset of TB) by A4;

A15: P[ ( 0 ) ]
proof
A16: ( ( Seq_of_ind ( T | A ) ) . ( 0 ) ) = { ( {} ( T | A ) ) } by CKB3:def 1
.= { ( {} T ) }
.= ( ( Seq_of_ind T ) . ( 0 ) ) by CKB3:def 1;

hence thesis by A16;

hence thesis;
