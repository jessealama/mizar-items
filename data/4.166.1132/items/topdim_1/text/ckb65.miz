theorem
Th33: (for X being set holds (for f being (SetSequence of X) holds (ex g being (SetSequence of X) st ((( union ( rng f ) ) = ( union ( rng g ) ) & (for i,j being Nat holds (i <> j implies ( g . i ) misses ( g . j )))) & (for n holds (ex fn being  finite (Subset-Family of X) st (fn = { ( f . i ) where i is (Element of ( NAT )): i < n } & ( g . n ) = ( ( f . n ) \ ( union fn ) ))))))))
proof
let X being set;
let f being (SetSequence of X);
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(for n holds (n = $1 implies (ex fn being  finite (Subset-Family of X) st (fn = { ( f . i ) where i is (Element of ( NAT )): i < n } & $2 = ( ( f . n ) \ ( union fn ) )))));
A1: (for x being set holds (x in ( NAT ) implies (ex y being set st (y in ( bool X ) & P[ x,y ]))))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( NAT );
then reconsider n = x as (Element of ( NAT ));
deffunc F(Nat) = ( f . $1 );
set fn = { F(i) where i is (Element of ( NAT )): i in n };
A2: fn c= ( bool X )
proof
let z being set;
assume z in fn;
then (ex i being (Element of ( NAT )) st (z = F(i) & i in n));
hence thesis;
end;
A3: n is  finite;
fn is  finite from FRAENKEL:sch 21(A3);
then reconsider fn as  finite (Subset-Family of X) by A2;
take y = ( ( f . n ) \ ( union fn ) );
thus y in ( bool X );
let m being Nat;
assume that
A4: m = x;
set Fn = { ( f . i ) where i is (Element of ( NAT )): i < n };
take fn;
A5: fn c= Fn
proof
let z being set;
assume z in fn;
then consider i being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A6: z = ( f . i ) and A7: i in n;
i < n by A7,NAT_1:44;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
Fn c= fn
proof
let z being set;
assume z in Fn;
then consider i being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A8: z = ( f . i ) and A9: i < n;
i in n by A9,NAT_1:44;
hence thesis by A8;
end;
hence thesis by A4,A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
consider g being (SetSequence of X) such that A10: (for x being set holds (x in ( NAT ) implies P[ x,( g . x ) ])) from FUNCT_2:sch 1(A1);
take g;
A11: ( union ( rng f ) ) c= ( union ( rng g ) )
proof
let y being set;
defpred Q[ Nat ]
 means
y in ( f . $1 );
assume y in ( union ( rng f ) );
then consider Y being set such that A12: y in Y and A13: Y in ( rng f ) by TARSKI:def 4;
(ex x being set st (x in ( dom f ) & ( f . x ) = Y)) by A13,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then A14: (ex n st Q[ n ]) by A12;
consider Min being Nat such that A15: Q[ Min ] and A16: (for n holds (Q[ n ] implies Min <= n)) from NAT_1:sch 5(A14);
A17: Min in ( NAT ) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
then consider fn being  finite (Subset-Family of X) such that A18: fn = { ( f . i ) where i is (Element of ( NAT )): i < Min } and A19: ( g . Min ) = ( ( f . Min ) \ ( union fn ) ) by A10;
(not y in ( union fn ))
proof
assume y in ( union fn );
then consider Z being set such that A20: y in Z and A21: Z in fn by TARSKI:def 4;
(ex i being (Element of ( NAT )) st (Z = ( f . i ) & i < Min)) by A18,A21;
hence thesis by A16,A20;
end;
then A22: y in ( g . Min ) by A15,A19,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
( dom g ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( g . Min ) in ( rng g ) by A17,FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A22,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
( union ( rng g ) ) c= ( union ( rng f ) )
proof
let y being set;
assume y in ( union ( rng g ) );
then consider Y being set such that A23: y in Y and A24: Y in ( rng g ) by TARSKI:def 4;
consider x being set such that A25: x in ( dom g ) and A26: ( g . x ) = Y by A24,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider n = x as Nat by A25;
(ex fn being  finite (Subset-Family of X) st (fn = { ( f . i ) where i is (Element of ( NAT )): i < n } & ( g . n ) = ( ( f . n ) \ ( union fn ) ))) by A10,A25;
then A27: y in ( f . n ) by A23,A26,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
( dom f ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( f . n ) in ( rng f ) by A25,FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A27,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
hence ( union ( rng f ) ) = ( union ( rng g ) ) by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
A28: (for i,j being Nat holds (i < j implies ( g . i ) misses ( g . j )))
proof
let i being Nat;
let j being Nat;
assume that
A29: i < j;
j in ( NAT ) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
then consider fj being  finite (Subset-Family of X) such that A30: fj = { ( f . n ) where n is (Element of ( NAT )): n < j } and A31: ( g . j ) = ( ( f . j ) \ ( union fj ) ) by A10;
assume ( g . i ) meets ( g . j );
then consider x being set such that A32: x in ( g . i ) and A33: x in ( g . j ) by XBOOLE_0:3;
A34: i in ( NAT ) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
then (ex fi being  finite (Subset-Family of X) st (fi = { ( f . n ) where n is (Element of ( NAT )): n < i } & ( g . i ) = ( ( f . i ) \ ( union fi ) ))) by A10;
then A35: x in ( f . i ) by A32,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
( f . i ) in fj by A29,A30,A34;
then x in ( union fj ) by A35,TARSKI:def 4;
hence contradiction by A31,A33,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
thus (for i,j being Nat holds (i <> j implies ( g . i ) misses ( g . j )))
proof
let i being Nat;
let j being Nat;
assume i <> j;
then (i < j or j < i) by XXREAL_0:1;
hence thesis by A28;
end;

let n;
n in ( NAT ) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
hence thesis by A10;
