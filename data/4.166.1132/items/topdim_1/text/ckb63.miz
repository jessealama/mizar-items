theorem
Th31: ((T is  finite-ind & ( ind T ) <= n) iff (ex Bas being (Basis of T) st (for A holds (A in Bas implies (( Fr A ) is  finite-ind & ( ind ( Fr A ) ) <= ( n - 1 ))))))
proof
set TOP = (the topology of T);
set cT = (the carrier of T);
hereby
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(for p being (Point of T) holds (for A being (Subset of T) holds ($1 = [ p,A ] implies (($2 in TOP & ((not p in A) implies $2 = ( {} T ))) & (p in A implies (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (((W = $2 & p in W) & W c= A) & ( ind ( Fr W ) ) <= ( n - 1 ))))))));
assume that
A1: T is  finite-ind
and
A2: ( ind T ) <= n;
A3: (for x being set holds (x in [: cT,TOP :] implies (ex y being set st P[ x,y ])))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in [: cT,TOP :];
then consider p9,A9 being set such that A4: p9 in cT and A5: A9 in TOP and A6: x = [ p9,A9 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider p9 as (Point of T) by A4;
reconsider A9 as  open (Subset of T) by A5,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
per cases ;
suppose A7: (not p9 in A9);

take ( {} T );
let p being (Point of T);
let A;
assume that
A8: x = [ p,A ];
p = p9 by A6,A8,ZFMISC_1:27;
hence thesis by A6,A7,A8,PRE_TOPC:def 2,ZFMISC_1:27;
end;
suppose p9 in A9;

then consider W being  open (Subset of T) such that A9: (p9 in W & W c= A9) and ( Fr W ) is  finite-ind and A10: ( ind ( Fr W ) ) <= ( n - 1 ) by A1,A2,CKB41:1;
take W;
let p being (Point of T);
let A;
assume x = [ p,A ];
then (p = p9 & A = A9) by A6,ZFMISC_1:27;

end;
end;
consider f being Function such that A11: ( dom f ) = [: cT,TOP :] and A12: (for x being set holds (x in [: cT,TOP :] implies P[ x,( f . x ) ])) from CLASSES1:sch 1(A3);
A13: ( rng f ) c= TOP
proof
let y being set;
assume y in ( rng f );
then consider x being set such that A14: x in ( dom f ) and A15: ( f . x ) = y by FUNCT_1:def 3;
(ex p,A being set st ((p in cT & A in TOP) & x = [ p,A ])) by A11,A14,ZFMISC_1:def 2;

end;
then reconsider RNG = ( rng f ) as (Subset-Family of T) by XBOOLE_1:1;
now
let A being (Subset of T);
assume A is  open;
then A16: A in TOP by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
let p being (Point of T);
assume that
A17: p in A;
A18: [ p,A ] in [: cT,TOP :] by A16,A17,ZFMISC_1:87;

reconsider W as (Subset of T);
take W;
thus ((W in RNG & p in W) & W c= A) by A11,A18,A19,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;
then reconsider RNG as (Basis of T) by A13,YELLOW_9:32;
take RNG;
let B being (Subset of T);
assume B in RNG;
then consider x being set such that A20: x in ( dom f ) and A21: ( f . x ) = B by FUNCT_1:def 3;
consider p,A being set such that A22: p in cT and A23: A in TOP and A24: x = [ p,A ] by A11,A20,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
per cases ;
suppose p in A;

then (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (((W = ( f . [ p,A ] ) & p in W) & W c= A) & ( ind ( Fr W ) ) <= ( n - 1 ))) by A11,A12,A20,A23,A24;
hence (( Fr B ) is  finite-ind & ( ind ( Fr B ) ) <= ( n - 1 )) by A1,A21,A24;
end;
suppose A25: (not p in A);

A26: T is non  empty by A22;
B = ( {} T ) by A11,A12,A20,A21,A22,A23,A24,A25;
then A27: ( Fr B ) = ( {} T ) by A26,TOPGEN_1:39;
( ( 0 ) - 1 ) <= ( n - 1 ) by XREAL_1:9;
hence (( Fr B ) is  finite-ind & ( ind ( Fr B ) ) <= ( n - 1 )) by A27,CKB24:1;
end;
end;
given B being (Basis of T) such that
A28: (for A being (Subset of T) holds (A in B implies (( Fr A ) is  finite-ind & ( ind ( Fr A ) ) <= ( n - 1 ))));

A29:now
let p being (Point of T);

then consider W being (Subset of T) such that A30: W in B and A31: (p in W & W c= U) by YELLOW_9:31;
B c= TOP by TOPS_2:64;
then reconsider W as  open (Subset of T) by A30,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
take W;
thus (((p in W & W c= U) & ( Fr W ) is  finite-ind) & ( ind ( Fr W ) ) <= ( n - 1 )) by A28,A30,A31;
end;
then T is  finite-ind by CKB40:1;
