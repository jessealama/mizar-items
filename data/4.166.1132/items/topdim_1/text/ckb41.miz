theorem
Th16: (( ind Tf ) <= n iff (for p being (Point of Tf) holds (for U being  open (Subset of Tf) holds (p in U implies (ex W being  open (Subset of Tf) st (((p in W & W c= U) & ( Fr W ) is  finite-ind) & ( ind ( Fr W ) ) <= ( n - 1 )))))))
proof
set CT = ( [#] Tf );
set TT = ( Tf | CT );
A1: ( [#] TT ) = CT by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
Tf is (SubSpace of Tf) by TSEP_1:2;
then A2: ( the TopStruct of Tf ) = ( the TopStruct of TT ) by A1,TSEP_1:5;
A3: CT is  finite-ind by CKB16:def 1;
hereby
assume A4: ( ind Tf ) <= n;
let p being (Point of Tf);
let U being  open (Subset of Tf);
assume that
A5: p in U;
reconsider p9 = p as (Point of TT) by A1;
U in (the topology of Tf) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then reconsider U9 = U as  open (Subset of TT) by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
consider W9 being  open (Subset of TT) such that A6: (p9 in W9 & W9 c= U9) and A7: (( Fr W9 ) is  finite-ind & ( ind ( Fr W9 ) ) <= ( n - 1 )) by A3,A4,A5,CKB29:1;
W9 in (the topology of TT) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then reconsider W = W9 as  open (Subset of Tf) by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
Tf is non  empty by A5;
then (( Cl W ) = ( Cl W9 ) & ( Int W ) = ( Int W9 )) by A1,TOPS_3:54;
then A8: ( Fr W ) = ( ( Cl W9 ) \ ( Int W9 ) ) by TOPGEN_1:8
.= ( Fr W9 ) by TOPGEN_1:8;
take W;
( Fr W9 ) in ( ( Seq_of_ind TT ) . n ) by A7,CKB27:1;
then A9: ( Fr W ) in ( ( Seq_of_ind Tf ) . n ) by A8,CKB5:1;
then ( Fr W ) is  finite-ind by CKB6:def 1;
hence (((p in W & W c= U) & ( Fr W ) is  finite-ind) & ( ind ( Fr W ) ) <= ( n - 1 )) by A6,A9,CKB27:1;
end;
assume A10: (for p being (Point of Tf) holds (for U being  open (Subset of Tf) holds (p in U implies (ex W being  open (Subset of Tf) st (((p in W & W c= U) & ( Fr W ) is  finite-ind) & ( ind ( Fr W ) ) <= ( n - 1 ))))));
now
let p9 being (Point of TT);
let U9 being  open (Subset of TT);
assume that
A11: p9 in U9;
reconsider p = p9 as (Point of Tf) by A1;
U9 in (the topology of TT) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then reconsider U = U9 as  open (Subset of Tf) by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
consider W being  open (Subset of Tf) such that A12: (p in W & W c= U) and A13: (( Fr W ) is  finite-ind & ( ind ( Fr W ) ) <= ( n - 1 )) by A10,A11;
W in (the topology of Tf) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then reconsider W9 = W as  open (Subset of TT) by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
Tf is non  empty by A11;
then (( Cl W ) = ( Cl W9 ) & ( Int W ) = ( Int W9 )) by A1,TOPS_3:54;
then A14: ( Fr W ) = ( ( Cl W9 ) \ ( Int W9 ) ) by TOPGEN_1:8
.= ( Fr W9 ) by TOPGEN_1:8;
take W9;
( Fr W ) in ( ( Seq_of_ind Tf ) . n ) by A13,CKB27:1;
then A15: ( Fr W9 ) in ( ( Seq_of_ind TT ) . n ) by A14,CKB5:1;
then ( Fr W9 ) is  finite-ind by CKB6:def 1;
hence (((p9 in W9 & W9 c= U9) & ( Fr W9 ) is  finite-ind) & ( ind ( Fr W9 ) ) <= ( n - 1 )) by A12,A15,CKB27:1;
end;
hence thesis by A3,CKB29:1;
