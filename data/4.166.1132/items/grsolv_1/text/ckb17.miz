theorem
Th14: (for G,H being  strict Group holds (for h being (Homomorphism of G,H) holds (for A being  strict (Subgroup of G) holds (for a being (Element of G) holds (( ( h . a ) * ( h .: A ) ) = ( h .: ( a * A ) ) & ( ( h .: A ) * ( h . a ) ) = ( h .: ( A * a ) ))))))
proof
let G being  strict Group;
let H being  strict Group;
let h being (Homomorphism of G,H);
let A being  strict (Subgroup of G);
let a being (Element of G);
now
let x being set;
assume x in ( h .: ( a * A ) );
then consider y being set such that A1: y in (the carrier of G) and A2: y in ( a * A ) and A3: x = ( h . y ) by FUNCT_2:64;
reconsider y as (Element of G) by A1;
consider b being (Element of G) such that A4: y = ( a * b ) and A5: b in A by A2,GROUP_2:103;
b in (the carrier of A) by A5,STRUCT_0:def 5;
then ( h . b ) in ( h .: (the carrier of A) ) by FUNCT_2:35;
then ( h . b ) in (the carrier of ( h .: A )) by CKB12:1;
then A6: ( h . b ) in ( h .: A ) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
x = ( ( h . a ) * ( h . b ) ) by A3,A4,GROUP_6:def 6;
hence x in ( ( h . a ) * ( h .: A ) ) by A6,GROUP_2:103;
end;
then A7: ( h .: ( a * A ) ) c= ( ( h . a ) * ( h .: A ) ) by TARSKI:def 3;
now
let x being set;
assume x in ( ( h . a ) * ( h .: A ) );
then consider b1 being (Element of H) such that A8: x = ( ( h . a ) * b1 ) and A9: b1 in ( h .: A ) by GROUP_2:103;
consider b being (Element of A) such that A10: b1 = ( ( h | A ) . b ) by A9,GROUP_6:45;
A11: b in A by STRUCT_0:def 5;
reconsider b as (Element of G) by GROUP_2:42;
b1 = ( h . b ) by A10,FUNCT_1:49;
then A12: x = ( h . ( a * b ) ) by A8,GROUP_6:def 6;
( a * b ) in ( a * A ) by A11,GROUP_2:103;
hence x in ( h .: ( a * A ) ) by A12,FUNCT_2:35;
end;
then ( ( h . a ) * ( h .: A ) ) c= ( h .: ( a * A ) ) by TARSKI:def 3;
hence ( ( h . a ) * ( h .: A ) ) = ( h .: ( a * A ) ) by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
now
let x being set;
assume x in ( h .: ( A * a ) );
then consider y being set such that A13: y in (the carrier of G) and A14: y in ( A * a ) and A15: x = ( h . y ) by FUNCT_2:64;
reconsider y as (Element of G) by A13;
consider b being (Element of G) such that A16: y = ( b * a ) and A17: b in A by A14,GROUP_2:104;
b in (the carrier of A) by A17,STRUCT_0:def 5;
then ( h . b ) in ( h .: (the carrier of A) ) by FUNCT_2:35;
then ( h . b ) in (the carrier of ( h .: A )) by CKB12:1;
then A18: ( h . b ) in ( h .: A ) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
x = ( ( h . b ) * ( h . a ) ) by A15,A16,GROUP_6:def 6;
hence x in ( ( h .: A ) * ( h . a ) ) by A18,GROUP_2:104;
end;
then A19: ( h .: ( A * a ) ) c= ( ( h .: A ) * ( h . a ) ) by TARSKI:def 3;
now
let x being set;
assume x in ( ( h .: A ) * ( h . a ) );
then consider b1 being (Element of H) such that A20: x = ( b1 * ( h . a ) ) and A21: b1 in ( h .: A ) by GROUP_2:104;
consider b being (Element of A) such that A22: b1 = ( ( h | A ) . b ) by A21,GROUP_6:45;
A23: b in A by STRUCT_0:def 5;
reconsider b as (Element of G) by GROUP_2:42;
b1 = ( h . b ) by A22,FUNCT_1:49;
then A24: x = ( h . ( b * a ) ) by A20,GROUP_6:def 6;
( b * a ) in ( A * a ) by A23,GROUP_2:104;
hence x in ( h .: ( A * a ) ) by A24,FUNCT_2:35;
end;
then ( ( h .: A ) * ( h . a ) ) c= ( h .: ( A * a ) ) by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis by A19,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
