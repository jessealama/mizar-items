theorem
Th16: (for G,H being  strict Group holds (for h being (Homomorphism of G,H) holds (for A,B being  strict (Subgroup of G) holds (A is  strict  normal  strict  normal (Subgroup of B) implies ( h .: A ) is  strict  normal  strict  normal (Subgroup of ( h .: B ))))))
proof
let G being  strict Group;
let H being  strict Group;
let h being (Homomorphism of G,H);
let A being  strict (Subgroup of G);
let B being  strict (Subgroup of G);
assume A is  strict  normal  strict  normal (Subgroup of B);
then reconsider A1 = A as  strict  normal (Subgroup of B);
reconsider C = ( h .: A1 ) as  strict (Subgroup of ( h .: B )) by CKB16:1;
(for b2 being (Element of ( h .: B )) holds ( b2 * C ) c= ( C * b2 ))
proof
let b2 being (Element of ( h .: B ));
A1: b2 in ( h .: B ) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
now
consider b1 being (Element of B) such that A2: b2 = ( ( h | B ) . b1 ) by A1,GROUP_6:45;
reconsider b1 as (Element of G) by GROUP_2:42;
A3: b2 = ( h . b1 ) by A2,FUNCT_1:49;
reconsider b = b1 as (Element of B);
let x being set;
assume x in ( b2 * C );
then consider g being (Element of ( h .: B )) such that A4: x = ( b2 * g ) and A5: g in C by GROUP_2:103;
consider g1 being (Element of A1) such that A6: g = ( ( h | A1 ) . g1 ) by A5,GROUP_6:45;
reconsider g1 as (Element of G) by GROUP_2:42;
g = ( h . g1 ) by A6,FUNCT_1:49;
then A7: x = ( ( h . b1 ) * ( h . g1 ) ) by A3,A4,GROUP_2:43
.= ( h . ( b1 * g1 ) ) by GROUP_6:def 6;
g1 in A1 by STRUCT_0:def 5;
then A8: ( b1 * g1 ) in ( b1 * A1 ) by GROUP_2:103;
A9: ( h .: ( A1 * b1 ) ) = ( ( h .: A1 ) * ( h . b1 ) ) by CKB17:1;
( b1 * A1 ) = ( b * A1 ) by GROUP_6:2
.= ( A1 * b ) by GROUP_3:117
.= ( A1 * b1 ) by GROUP_6:2;
then x in ( h .: ( A1 * b1 ) ) by A7,A8,FUNCT_2:35;
hence x in ( C * b2 ) by A3,A9,GROUP_6:2;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 3;
end;
hence thesis by GROUP_3:118;
