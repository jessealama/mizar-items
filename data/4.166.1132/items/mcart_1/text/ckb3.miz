theorem
(X <> ( {} ) implies (ex Y st (Y in X & (for Y1 holds (for Y2 holds ((Y1 in Y2 & Y2 in Y) implies Y1 misses X))))))
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex Y1 st (Y1 in $1 & Y1 meets X));
consider Z1 such that A1: (for Y holds (Y in Z1 iff (Y in ( union X ) & P[ Y ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
defpred Q[ set ]
 means
$1 meets X;
consider Z2 such that A2: (for Y holds (Y in Z2 iff (Y in ( union ( union X ) ) & Q[ Y ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
assume X <> ( {} );
then consider Y such that A3: Y in ( ( X \/ Z1 ) \/ Z2 ) and A4: Y misses ( ( X \/ Z1 ) \/ Z2 ) by CKB1:1;
A5:now
assume A6: Y in Z1;
then consider Y1 such that A7: Y1 in Y and A8: Y1 meets X by A1;
Y in ( union X ) by A1,A6;
then Y1 in ( union ( union X ) ) by A7,TARSKI:def 4;
then Y1 in Z2 by A2,A8;
then Y1 in ( ( X \/ Z1 ) \/ Z2 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence contradiction by A4,A7,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
assume A9: (not thesis);
A10:now
assume A11: Y in X;
then consider Y1,Y2 such that A12: Y1 in Y2 and A13: Y2 in Y and A14: (not Y1 misses X) by A9;
Y2 in ( union X ) by A11,A13,TARSKI:def 4;
then Y2 in Z1 by A1,A12,A14;
then Y2 in ( X \/ Z1 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then Y2 in ( ( X \/ Z1 ) \/ Z2 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence contradiction by A4,A13,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
Y in ( X \/ ( Z1 \/ Z2 ) ) by A3,XBOOLE_1:4;
then Y in ( Z1 \/ Z2 ) by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then Y in Z2 by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then Y meets X by A2;
then Y meets ( X \/ Z1 ) by XBOOLE_1:70;
hence contradiction by A4,XBOOLE_1:70;
