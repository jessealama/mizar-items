theorem
Th4: (X <> ( {} ) implies (ex Y st (Y in X & (for Y1 holds (for Y2 holds (for Y3 holds (((Y1 in Y2 & Y2 in Y3) & Y3 in Y) implies Y1 misses X)))))))
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex Y1 st (ex Y2 st ((Y1 in Y2 & Y2 in $1) & Y1 meets X)));
consider Z1 such that A1: (for Y holds (Y in Z1 iff (Y in ( union X ) & P[ Y ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
defpred R[ set ]
 means
$1 meets X;
defpred Q[ set ]
 means
(ex Y1 st (Y1 in $1 & Y1 meets X));
consider Z2 such that A2: (for Y holds (Y in Z2 iff (Y in ( union ( union X ) ) & Q[ Y ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
consider Z3 such that A3: (for Y holds (Y in Z3 iff (Y in ( union ( union ( union X ) ) ) & R[ Y ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
assume X <> ( {} );
then consider Y such that A4: Y in ( ( ( X \/ Z1 ) \/ Z2 ) \/ Z3 ) and A5: Y misses ( ( ( X \/ Z1 ) \/ Z2 ) \/ Z3 ) by CKB1:1;
A6:now
assume A7: Y in Z2;
then consider Y1 such that A8: Y1 in Y and A9: Y1 meets X by A2;
Y in ( union ( union X ) ) by A2,A7;
then Y1 in ( union ( union ( union X ) ) ) by A8,TARSKI:def 4;
then Y1 in Z3 by A3,A9;
then Y1 in ( ( ( X \/ Z1 ) \/ Z2 ) \/ Z3 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence contradiction by A5,A8,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
A10:now
assume A11: Y in Z1;
then consider Y1,Y2 such that A12: Y1 in Y2 and A13: Y2 in Y and A14: Y1 meets X by A1;
Y in ( union X ) by A1,A11;
then Y2 in ( union ( union X ) ) by A13,TARSKI:def 4;
then Y2 in Z2 by A2,A12,A14;
then Y2 in ( ( X \/ Z1 ) \/ Z2 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then Y meets ( ( X \/ Z1 ) \/ Z2 ) by A13,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence contradiction by A5,XBOOLE_1:70;

Y3 in ( union X ) by A17,A19,TARSKI:def 4;
then Y3 in Z1 by A1,A18,A20;
then Y3 in ( X \/ Z1 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then Y3 in ( ( X \/ Z1 ) \/ Z2 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then Y3 in ( ( ( X \/ Z1 ) \/ Z2 ) \/ Z3 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence contradiction by A5,A19,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
then Y in ( ( Z1 \/ Z2 ) \/ Z3 ) by A15,A4,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
