theorem
Th8: (for N being  symmetric non  empty MetrStruct holds (for S2 being (sequence of N) holds (S2 is  Cauchy iff (for r holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex p st (for n holds (for k holds (p <= n implies ( dist (( S2 . ( n + k ) ),( S2 . n )) ) < r)))))))))
proof
let N being  symmetric non  empty MetrStruct;
let S2 being (sequence of N);
thus (S2 is  Cauchy implies (for r holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex p st (for n holds (for k holds (p <= n implies ( dist (( S2 . ( n + k ) ),( S2 . n )) ) < r)))))))
proof
assume A1: S2 is  Cauchy;
let r;
assume ( 0 ) < r;
then consider p such that A2: (for n holds (for m holds ((p <= n & p <= m) implies ( dist (( S2 . n ),( S2 . m )) ) < r))) by A1,CKB9:def 1;
take p;
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
let k being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume that
A3: p <= n;
n <= ( n + k ) by NAT_1:11;
then p <= ( n + k ) by A3,XXREAL_0:2;
hence thesis by A2,A3;
end;

assume A4: (for r holds (r > ( 0 ) implies (ex p st (for n holds (for k holds (p <= n implies ( dist (( S2 . ( n + k ) ),( S2 . n )) ) < r))))));
let r;
assume ( 0 ) < r;
then consider p such that A5: (for n holds (for k holds (p <= n implies ( dist (( S2 . ( n + k ) ),( S2 . n )) ) < r))) by A4;
take p;
let n;
let m;
assume that
A6: p <= n
and
A7: p <= m;
per cases ;
suppose n <= m;

then consider k being Nat such that A8: m = ( n + k ) by NAT_1:10;
reconsider m9 = m,n9 = n,k as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
m = ( n + k ) by A8;
then ( dist (( S2 . m9 ),( S2 . n9 )) ) < r by A5,A6;
hence thesis;
end;
suppose m <= n;

then consider k being Nat such that A9: n = ( m + k ) by NAT_1:10;
reconsider k as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
n = ( m + k ) by A9;
hence thesis by A5,A7;
