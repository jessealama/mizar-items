theorem
((N is  Reflexive  triangle & ( TopSpaceMetr N ) is  compact) implies N is  totally_bounded)
proof
assume A1: N is  Reflexive;
set TM = ( TopSpaceMetr N );
assume A2: N is  triangle;
assume A3: ( TopSpaceMetr N ) is  compact;
let r;
assume that
A4: r > ( 0 );
defpred X[ (Subset of N) ]
 means
(ex x being (Element of N) st $1 = ( Ball (x,r) ));
consider G being (Subset-Family of N) such that A5: (for C holds (C in G iff X[ C ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
A6: TM = TopStruct (# (the carrier of N),( Family_open_set N ) #) by PCOMPS_1:def 5;
then reconsider G as (Subset-Family of ( TopSpaceMetr N ));
(for x being (Element of TM) holds x in ( union G ))
proof
let x being (Element of TM);
reconsider x as (Element of N) by A6;
( dist (x,x) ) = ( 0 ) by A1,METRIC_1:1;
then A7: x in ( Ball (x,r) ) by A4,METRIC_1:11;
( Ball (x,r) ) in G by A5;
hence thesis by A7,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
then ( [#] TM ) = ( union G ) by SUBSET_1:28;
then A8: G is (Cover of TM) by SETFAM_1:45;
(for C being (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr N )) holds (C in G implies C is  open))
proof
let C being (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr N ));
assume that
A9: C in G;
reconsider C as (Subset of N) by A6;
(ex x being (Element of N) st C = ( Ball (x,r) )) by A5,A9;
then C in (the topology of TM) by A2,A6,PCOMPS_1:29;
hence thesis by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
end;
then G is  open by TOPS_2:def 1;
then consider H being (Subset-Family of TM) such that A10: H c= G and A11: H is (Cover of TM) and A12: H is  finite by A3,A8,COMPTS_1:def 1;
reconsider H as (Subset-Family of N) by A6;
take H;
( union H ) = (the carrier of TM) by A11,SETFAM_1:45;
hence thesis by A6,A5,A10,A12;
