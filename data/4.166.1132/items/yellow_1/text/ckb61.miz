definition
let S being RelStr;
let T being RelStr;
func MonMaps (S,T) ->  strict  full (SubRelStr of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) )) means 
(for f being (Function of S,T) holds (f in (the carrier of it) iff (f in ( Funcs ((the carrier of S),(the carrier of T)) ) & f is  monotone)));
existence
proof
set X = ( MonFuncs (S,T) );
X c= ( Funcs ((the carrier of S),(the carrier of T)) ) by ORDERS_3:11;
then reconsider X as (Subset of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) )) by CKB51:1;
take SX = ( subrelstr X );
let f being (Function of S,T);
hereby
assume f in (the carrier of SX);
then f in X by YELLOW_0:def 15;
then (ex f9 being (Function of S,T) st ((f9 = f & f9 in ( Funcs ((the carrier of S),(the carrier of T)) )) & f9 is  monotone)) by ORDERS_3:def 6;
hence (f in ( Funcs ((the carrier of S),(the carrier of T)) ) & f is  monotone);
end;
assume (f in ( Funcs ((the carrier of S),(the carrier of T)) ) & f is  monotone);
then f in X by ORDERS_3:def 6;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:def 15;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let A1 being  strict  full (SubRelStr of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ));
let A2 being  strict  full (SubRelStr of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ));
assume that
A1: (for f being (Function of S,T) holds (f in (the carrier of A1) iff (f in ( Funcs ((the carrier of S),(the carrier of T)) ) & f is  monotone)))
and
A2: (for f being (Function of S,T) holds (f in (the carrier of A2) iff (f in ( Funcs ((the carrier of S),(the carrier of T)) ) & f is  monotone)));
(the carrier of A2) c= (the carrier of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) )) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
then A3: (the carrier of A2) c= ( Funcs ((the carrier of S),(the carrier of T)) ) by CKB51:1;
A4: (the carrier of A2) c= (the carrier of A1)
proof
let a being set;
assume A5: a in (the carrier of A2);
then reconsider f = a as (Function of S,T) by A3,FUNCT_2:66;
f is  monotone by A2,A5;
hence thesis by A1,A3,A5;
end;
(the carrier of A1) c= (the carrier of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) )) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
then A6: (the carrier of A1) c= ( Funcs ((the carrier of S),(the carrier of T)) ) by CKB51:1;
(the carrier of A1) c= (the carrier of A2)
proof
let a being set;
assume A7: a in (the carrier of A1);
then reconsider f = a as (Function of S,T) by A6,FUNCT_2:66;
f is  monotone by A1,A7;
hence thesis by A2,A6,A7;
end;
then (the carrier of A1) = (the carrier of A2) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:57;
