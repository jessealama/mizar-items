proof
let L being LATTICE;
assume A1: L is  modular;
now
given a being (Element of L),b being (Element of L),c being (Element of L),d being (Element of L),e being (Element of L) such that
a <> b
and
a <> c
and
A2: a <> d
and
a <> e
and
b <> c
and
b <> d
and
b <> e
and
c <> d
and
c <> e
and
d <> e
and
( a "/\" b ) = a
and
( a "/\" c ) = a
and
( a "/\" d ) = a
and
( b "/\" e ) = b
and
( c "/\" e ) = c
and
A3: ( d "/\" e ) = d
and
A4: ( b "/\" c ) = a
and
A5: ( b "/\" d ) = a
and
A6: ( c "/\" d ) = a
and
A7: ( b "\/" c ) = e
and
( b "\/" d ) = e
and
( c "\/" d ) = e;

( ( b "/\" c ) "\/" ( b "/\" d ) ) = a by A4,A5,YELLOW_5:1;
hence (not L is  distributive) by A2,A3,A4,A6,A7,WAYBEL_1:def 3;
end;
hence (L is  distributive implies (not (ex a,b,c,d,e being (Element of L) st (((((((((((((((((((((a <> b & a <> c) & a <> d) & a <> e) & b <> c) & b <> d) & b <> e) & c <> d) & c <> e) & d <> e) & ( a "/\" b ) = a) & ( a "/\" c ) = a) & ( a "/\" d ) = a) & ( b "/\" e ) = b) & ( c "/\" e ) = c) & ( d "/\" e ) = d) & ( b "/\" c ) = a) & ( b "/\" d ) = a) & ( c "/\" d ) = a) & ( b "\/" c ) = e) & ( b "\/" d ) = e) & ( c "\/" d ) = e))));
now
assume (not L is  distributive);
then consider x,y,z being (Element of L) such that A8: ( x "/\" ( y "\/" z ) ) <> ( ( x "/\" y ) "\/" ( x "/\" z ) ) by WAYBEL_1:def 3;
set t = ( ( ( x "\/" y ) "/\" ( y "\/" z ) ) "/\" ( z "\/" x ) );

A13: ( z "/\" x ) <= x by YELLOW_0:23;
A14:now
assume b = t;

reconsider b,x1,y1,z1,t as (Element of L);
take b;
take x1;
take y1;
take z1;
take t;
