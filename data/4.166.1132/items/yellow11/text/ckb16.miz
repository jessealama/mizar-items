Th9: (for L being LATTICE holds ((ex K being  full (Sublattice of L) st ( N_5 ),K are_isomorphic ) iff (ex a,b,c,d,e being (Element of L) st ((((((((((((((((((a <> b & a <> c) & a <> d) & a <> e) & b <> c) & b <> d) & b <> e) & c <> d) & c <> e) & d <> e) & ( a "/\" b ) = a) & ( a "/\" c ) = a) & ( c "/\" e ) = c) & ( d "/\" e ) = d) & ( b "/\" c ) = a) & ( b "/\" d ) = b) & ( c "/\" d ) = a) & ( b "\/" c ) = e) & ( c "\/" d ) = e))))
proof
set cn = (the carrier of ( N_5 ));

A1: cn = { ( 0 ),( 3 \ 1 ),2,( 3 \ 2 ),3 } by YELLOW_1:1;
thus ((ex K being  full (Sublattice of L) st ( N_5 ),K are_isomorphic ) implies (ex a,b,c,d,e being (Element of L) st ((((((((((((((((((a <> b & a <> c) & a <> d) & a <> e) & b <> c) & b <> d) & b <> e) & c <> d) & c <> e) & d <> e) & ( a "/\" b ) = a) & ( a "/\" c ) = a) & ( c "/\" e ) = c) & ( d "/\" e ) = d) & ( b "/\" c ) = a) & ( b "/\" d ) = b) & ( c "/\" d ) = a) & ( b "\/" c ) = e) & ( c "\/" d ) = e)))
