func ==>.-relation TS -> (Relation of [: (the carrier of TS),( E ^omega ) :])
means
:Def4: ([ [ x1,x2 ],[ y1,y2 ] ] in it iff x1,x2 ==>. y1,y2,TS);
existence
proof
defpred P[ (Element of [: (the carrier of TS),( E ^omega ) :]),(Element of [: (the carrier of TS),( E ^omega ) :]) ]
 means
(ex x1 st (ex x2 st (ex y1 st (ex y2 st (([ x1,x2 ] = $1 & [ y1,y2 ] = $2) & x1,x2 ==>. y1,y2,TS)))));
consider R being (Relation of [: (the carrier of TS),( E ^omega ) :]) such that A1: (for s,t being (Element of [: (the carrier of TS),( E ^omega ) :]) holds ([ s,t ] in R iff P[ s,t ])) from RELSET_1:sch 2;
take R;
now
let x1;
let x2;
let y1;
let y2;
set s = [ x1,x2 ];
set t = [ y1,y2 ];
A2: (( dom R ) c= [: (the carrier of TS),( E ^omega ) :] & ( rng R ) c= [: (the carrier of TS),( E ^omega ) :]) by RELAT_1:def 18,RELAT_1:def 19;
thus (x1,x2 ==>. y1,y2,TS implies [ [ x1,x2 ],[ y1,y2 ] ] in R)
proof
assume A3: x1,x2 ==>. y1,y2,TS;
then y1 in TS by CKB25:1;
then A4: y1 in (the carrier of TS) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
x1 in TS by A3,CKB25:1;
then A5: x1 in (the carrier of TS) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
y2 in ( E ^omega ) by A3,CKB25:1;
then A6: t in [: (the carrier of TS),( E ^omega ) :] by A4,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
x2 in ( E ^omega ) by A3,CKB25:1;
then s in [: (the carrier of TS),( E ^omega ) :] by A5,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
hence thesis by A1,A3,A6;
end;

assume A7: [ [ x1,x2 ],[ y1,y2 ] ] in R;
then ([ x1,x2 ] in ( dom R ) & [ y1,y2 ] in ( rng R )) by RELAT_1:6;
then consider x19 being set,x29 being set,y19 being set,y29 being set such that A8: [ x19,x29 ] = s and A9: [ y19,y29 ] = t and A10: x19,x29 ==>. y19,y29,TS by A1,A7,A2;
A11: y1 = y19 by A9,ZFMISC_1:27;
(x1 = x19 & x2 = x29) by A8,ZFMISC_1:27;
hence x1,x2 ==>. y1,y2,TS by A9,A10,A11,ZFMISC_1:27;

hence thesis;

uniqueness
proof
let R1 being (Relation of [: (the carrier of TS),( E ^omega ) :]),R2 being (Relation of [: (the carrier of TS),( E ^omega ) :]);
assume that

and
A13: ([ [ x1,x2 ],[ y1,y2 ] ] in R2 iff x1,x2 ==>. y1,y2,TS);
now
let s being (Element of [: (the carrier of TS),( E ^omega ) :]),t being (Element of [: (the carrier of TS),( E ^omega ) :]);
consider x being set,u being set such that A14: x in (the carrier of TS) and A15: u in ( E ^omega ) and A16: s = [ x,u ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider u as (Element of ( E ^omega )) by A15;
reconsider x as (Element of TS) by A14;
consider y being set,v being set such that A17: y in (the carrier of TS) and A18: v in ( E ^omega ) and A19: t = [ y,v ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider v as (Element of ( E ^omega )) by A18;
reconsider y as (Element of TS) by A17;
([ s,t ] in R1 iff x,u ==>. y,v,TS) by A12,A16,A19;
hence ([ s,t ] in R1 iff [ s,t ] in R2) by A13,A16,A19;
end;
hence thesis by RELSET_1:def 2;
