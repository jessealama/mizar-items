means
:Def2: (for A being non empty (Subset of T) holds (ex a being (Element of T) st (a in A & (for b being (Element of T) holds (b in A implies (not a < b))))));
compatibility
proof
set R = (the InternalRel of T);
thus (T is  Noetherian implies (for A being non empty (Subset of T) holds (ex a being (Element of T) st (a in A & (for b being (Element of T) holds (b in A implies (not a < b)))))))
proof
assume A1: (for Y being set holds ((Y c= ( field R ) & Y <> ( {} )) implies (ex a being set st (a in Y & (for b being set holds ((b in Y & a <> b) implies (not [ a,b ] in R)))))));
let A being non empty (Subset of T);
set a = the (Element of A);
reconsider a as (Element of T);
set Y = ( A /\ ( field R ) );
per cases ;
suppose A2: A misses ( field R );

take a;
thus a in A;
let b being (Element of T);
assume that
b in A
and
A3: a < b;
a <= b by A3,ORDERS_2:def 6;
then [ a,b ] in R by ORDERS_2:def 5;
then a in ( field R ) by RELAT_1:15;
hence contradiction by A2,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
suppose A meets ( field R );

then Y <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then consider x being set such that A4: x in Y and A5: (for y being set holds ((y in Y & x <> y) implies (not [ x,y ] in R))) by A1,XBOOLE_1:17;
reconsider x as (Element of T) by A4;
take x;
thus x in A by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
let b being (Element of T);
assume that
A6: b in A
and
A7: x < b;
x <= b by A7,ORDERS_2:def 6;
then A8: [ x,b ] in R by ORDERS_2:def 5;
then b in ( field R ) by RELAT_1:15;
then b in Y by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence contradiction by A5,A7,A8;
end;

assume A9: (for A being non empty (Subset of T) holds (ex a being (Element of T) st (a in A & (for b being (Element of T) holds (b in A implies (not a < b))))));
let Y being set;
assume that
A10: Y c= ( field R )
and
A11: Y <> ( {} );
( field R ) c= ( (the carrier of T) \/ (the carrier of T) ) by RELSET_1:8;
then reconsider A = Y as non empty (Subset of T) by A10,A11,XBOOLE_1:1;
consider a being (Element of T) such that A12: a in A and A13: (for b being (Element of T) holds (b in A implies (not a < b))) by A9;
take a;
thus a in Y by A12;
let b being set;
assume that
A14: b in Y
and
A15: a <> b;
b in A by A14;
then reconsider b as (Element of T);
(not a < b) by A13,A14;
then (not a <= b) by A15,ORDERS_2:def 6;
