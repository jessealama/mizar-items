theorem
Th24: ((((((((X is  being_plane & Y is  being_plane) & a in X) & b in X) & a in Y) & b in Y) & X <> Y) & a <> b) implies ( X /\ Y ) is  being_line)
proof
assume that
A1: X is  being_plane
and
A2: Y is  being_plane
and
A3: (a in X & b in X)
and
A4: (a in Y & b in Y)
and
A5: X <> Y
and
A6: a <> b;

A8: Q c= Y by A2,A4,A6,CKB26:1;
A9: Q is  being_line by A6,AFF_1:def 3;
A10: Z c= Q
proof
assume (not Z c= Q);
then consider x being set such that A11: x in Z and A12: (not x in Q) by TARSKI:def 3;

A13: x in Y by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A14: x in X by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
(for y being set holds (y in X iff y in Y))
proof
let y being set;
