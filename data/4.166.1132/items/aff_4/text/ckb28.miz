theorem
Th20: (((((K is  being_line & P is  being_line) & Q is  being_line) & (not K // Q)) & Q c= ( Plane (K,P) )) implies ( Plane (K,Q) ) = ( Plane (K,P) ))
proof
assume that
A1: K is  being_line
and
A2: P is  being_line
and
A3: Q is  being_line
and
A4: (not K // Q)
and
A5: Q c= ( Plane (K,P) );
A6: ( Plane (K,Q) ) c= ( Plane (K,P) ) by A1,A5,CKB27:1;
consider a,b such that A7: a in Q and A8: b in Q and A9: a <> b by A3,AFF_1:19;
consider b9 such that A10: b,b9 // K and A11: b9 in P by A5,A8,CKB17:1;
b9,b // K by A10,AFF_1:34;
then A12: b9 in ( Plane (K,Q) ) by A8;
consider a9 such that A13: a,a9 // K and A14: a9 in P by A5,A7,CKB17:1;
A15: a9 <> b9
proof
consider A such that A16: a9 in A and A17: K // A by A1,AFF_1:49;
a9,a // A by A13,A17,CKB4:1;
then A18: a in A by A16,CKB3:1;
assume a9 = b9;
then a9,b // A by A10,A17,CKB4:1;
then A19: b in A by A16,CKB3:1;
A is  being_line by A17,AFF_1:36;
hence contradiction by A3,A4,A7,A8,A9,A17,A19,A18,AFF_1:18;
end;
a9,a // K by A13,AFF_1:34;
then a9 in ( Plane (K,Q) ) by A7;
then ( Plane (K,P) ) c= ( Plane (K,Q) ) by A1,A2,A3,A14,A11,A15,A12,CKB25:1,CKB27:1;
hence thesis by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
