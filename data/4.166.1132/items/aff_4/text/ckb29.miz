theorem
Th21: ((((K is  being_line & P is  being_line) & Q is  being_line) & Q c= ( Plane (K,P) )) implies (P // Q or (ex q st (q in P & q in Q))))
proof
assume that
A1: K is  being_line
and
A2: P is  being_line
and
A3: Q is  being_line
and
A4: Q c= ( Plane (K,P) );
consider a,b such that A5: a in Q and A6: b in Q and A7: a <> b by A3,AFF_1:19;
consider a9 such that A8: a,a9 // K and A9: a9 in P by A4,A5,CKB17:1;
consider A such that A10: a9 in A and A11: K // A by A1,AFF_1:49;
A12: a9,a // A by A8,A11,CKB4:1;
then A13: a in A by A10,CKB3:1;
consider b9 such that A14: b,b9 // K and A15: b9 in P by A4,A6,CKB17:1;
consider M such that A16: b9 in M and A17: K // M by A1,AFF_1:49;
A18: b9,b // M by A14,A17,CKB4:1;
then A19: b in M by A16,CKB3:1;
A20: A is  being_line by A11,AFF_1:36;
A21:now
assume A = M;
then A22: b in A by A16,A18,CKB3:1;
a in A by A10,A12,CKB3:1;
then a9 in Q by A3,A5,A6,A7,A10,A20,A22,AFF_1:18;
hence (ex q st (q in P & q in Q)) by A9;
end;
A // M by A11,A17,AFF_1:44;
