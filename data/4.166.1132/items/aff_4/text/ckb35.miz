theorem
Th26: (((((((((X is  being_plane & Y is  being_plane) & M is  being_line) & N is  being_line) & M c= X) & N c= X) & M c= Y) & N c= Y) & M <> N) implies X = Y)
proof
assume that
A1: X is  being_plane
and
A2: Y is  being_plane
and
A3: M is  being_line
and
A4: N is  being_line
and
A5: (M c= X & N c= X)
and
A6: (M c= Y & N c= Y)
and
A7: M <> N;
consider a,b such that A8: a in M and A9: b in M and A10: a <> b by A3,AFF_1:19;
A11:now
given q such that
A12: q in M
and
A13: q in N;

consider p such that A14: q <> p and A15: p in N by A4,AFF_1:20;
A16: (not p in M) by A3,A4,A7,A12,A13,A14,A15,AFF_1:18;
A17:now
assume b <> q;
then (not  LIN b,q,p) by A3,A9,A12,A16,CKB34:1;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A5,A6,A9,A12,A15,CKB33:1;
end;
now
assume a <> q;
then (not  LIN a,q,p) by A3,A8,A12,A16,CKB34:1;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A5,A6,A8,A12,A15,CKB33:1;
end;
hence thesis by A10,A17;
end;
consider c,d such that A18: c in N and d in N and c <> d by A4,AFF_1:19;
now
assume M // N;
then (not c in M) by A7,A18,AFF_1:45;
then (not  LIN a,b,c) by A3,A8,A9,A10,CKB34:1;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A5,A6,A8,A9,A18,CKB33:1;
end;
hence thesis by A1,A3,A4,A5,A11,CKB30:1;
