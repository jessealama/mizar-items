theorem
Th54: ((((not  LIN a,b,c) & a9 <> b9) & a,b // a9,b9) implies (ex c9 st (a,c // a9,c9 & b,c // b9,c9)))
proof
assume that
A1: (not  LIN a,b,c)
and
A2: a9 <> b9
and
A3: a,b // a9,b9;
now
consider X such that A4: a in X and A5: b in X and A6: c in X and A7: X is  being_plane by CKB50:1;

A21: b9 in AB9 by AFF_1:15;
A22: (not b9 in X)
proof

proof
