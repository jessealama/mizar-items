proof
assume that
A1: p in M
and
A2: a in M
and
A3: b in M
and
A4: p in N
and
A5: a9 in N
and
A6: b9 in N
and
A7: (not p in P)
and
A8: (not p in Q)
and
A9: M <> N
and
A10: a in P
and
A11: a9 in P
and
A12: b in Q
and
A13: b9 in Q
and
A14: M is  being_line
and
A15: N is  being_line
and
A16: P is  being_line
and
A17: Q is  being_line;
A18: a <> a9 by A1,A2,A4,A5,A7,A9,A10,A14,A15,AFF_1:18;
 LIN p,a,b by A1,A2,A3,A14,AFF_1:21;
then consider c such that A19:  LIN p,a9,c and A20: a,a9 // b,c by A7,A10,CKB2:1;
set D = ( Line (b,c) );
A21: b in D by AFF_1:15;
A22: c in D by AFF_1:15;
A23: b <> b9 by A1,A3,A4,A6,A8,A9,A12,A14,A15,AFF_1:18;
A24: c in N by A4,A5,A7,A11,A15,A19,AFF_1:25;
then A25: b <> c by A1,A3,A4,A8,A9,A12,A14,A15,AFF_1:18;
then A26: D is  being_line by AFF_1:def 3;
now
assume D <> Q;
then A27: c <> b9 by A12,A13,A17,A23,A26,A21,A22,AFF_1:18;
 LIN b9,c,a9 by A5,A6,A15,A24,AFF_1:21;
then consider q such that A28:  LIN b9,b,q and A29: c,b // a9,q by A27,CKB2:1;
a9,a // c,b by A20,AFF_1:4;
then a9,a // a9,q by A25,A29,AFF_1:5;
then  LIN a9,a,q by AFF_1:def 1;
then A30: q in P by A10,A11,A16,A18,AFF_1:25;
q in Q by A12,A13,A17,A23,A28,AFF_1:25;
hence (ex q st (q in P & q in Q)) by A30;

hence thesis by A10,A11,A12,A16,A17,A18,A20,A25,A22,AFF_1:38;
