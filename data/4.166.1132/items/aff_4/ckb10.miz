theorem
Th8: ((((((((((((q in M & q in N) & a in M) & b in N) & b9 in N) & q <> a) & q <> b) & M <> N) & (a,b // a9,b9 or b,a // b9,a9)) & M is  being_line) & N is  being_line) & q = a9) implies q = b9)
proof
assume that
A1: q in M
and
A2: q in N
and
A3: a in M
and
A4: b in N
and
A5: b9 in N
and
A6: q <> a
and
A7: (q <> b & M <> N)
and
A8: (a,b // a9,b9 or b,a // b9,a9)
and
A9: M is  being_line
and
A10: N is  being_line
and
A11: q = a9;
A12: (not  LIN q,a,b)
proof
assume (not thesis);
then consider A such that A13: (A is  being_line & q in A) and A14: a in A and A15: b in A by AFF_1:21;
M = A by A1,A3,A6,A9,A13,A14,AFF_1:18;
hence contradiction by A2,A4,A7,A10,A13,A15,AFF_1:18;
end;
( LIN q,b,b9 & a,b // a9,b9) by A2,A4,A5,A8,A10,AFF_1:4,AFF_1:21;
hence thesis by A11,A12,AFF_1:55;
