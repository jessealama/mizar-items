theorem
Th23: (((((X is  being_plane & a in X) & M c= X) & a in N) & (M // N or N // M)) implies N c= X)
proof
assume that
A1: X is  being_plane
and
A2: a in X
and
A3: M c= X
and
A4: a in N
and
A5: (M // N or N // M);
A6: M is  being_line by A5,AFF_1:36;
consider K,P such that A7: K is  being_line and A8: P is  being_line and (not K // P) and A9: X = ( Plane (K,P) ) by A1,CKB16:def 1;
A10: N is  being_line by A5,AFF_1:36;
A11:now
assume A12: (not K // M);
then A13: X = ( Plane (K,M) ) by A3,A6,A7,A8,A9,CKB28:1;
A14: a in ( Plane (K,M) ) by A2,A3,A6,A7,A8,A9,A12,CKB28:1;
now
consider a9 such that A15: a,a9 // K and A16: a9 in M by A14,CKB17:1;
consider b9 such that A17: a9 <> b9 and A18: b9 in M by A6,AFF_1:20;
consider b such that A19: a9,a // b9,b and A20: a9,b9 // a,b by DIRAF:40;
assume A21: M <> N;
then a <> a9 by A4,A5,A16,AFF_1:45;
then b,b9 // K by A15,A19,CKB5:1;
then A22: b in ( Plane (K,M) ) by A18;
A23: a <> b
proof
assume a = b;
then a,a9 // a,b9 by A19,AFF_1:4;
then  LIN a,a9,b9 by AFF_1:def 1;
then  LIN a9,b9,a by AFF_1:6;
then a in M by A6,A16,A17,A18,AFF_1:25;
hence contradiction by A4,A5,A21,AFF_1:45;
end;
a,b // M by A6,A16,A17,A18,A20,AFF_1:32,AFF_1:52;
then a,b // N by A5,CKB4:1;
then b in N by A4,CKB3:1;
hence thesis by A2,A4,A6,A10,A7,A13,A23,A22,CKB25:1;
end;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
now
assume K // M;
then K // N by A5,AFF_1:44;
hence thesis by A2,A4,A9,CKB24:1;
end;
hence thesis by A11;
