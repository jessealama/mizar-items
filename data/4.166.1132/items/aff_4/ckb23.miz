theorem
Th18: ((((((((((((a in M & b in M) & a9 in N) & b9 in N) & a in P) & a9 in P) & b in Q) & b9 in Q) & M <> N) & M // N) & P is  being_line) & Q is  being_line) implies (P // Q or (ex q st (q in P & q in Q))))
proof
assume that
A1: a in M
and
A2: b in M
and
A3: a9 in N
and
A4: b9 in N
and
A5: a in P
and
A6: a9 in P
and
A7: b in Q
and
A8: b9 in Q
and
A9: M <> N
and
A10: M // N
and
A11: P is  being_line
and
A12: Q is  being_line;
A13: a <> a9 by A1,A3,A9,A10,AFF_1:45;
A14: N is  being_line by A10,AFF_1:36;
A15: b <> b9 by A2,A4,A9,A10,AFF_1:45;
A16: M is  being_line by A10,AFF_1:36;
now
assume A17: a <> b;
consider c such that A18: a,b // a9,c and A19: a,a9 // b,c by DIRAF:40;
set D = ( Line (b,c) );
A20: b in D by AFF_1:15;
A21: c in D by AFF_1:15;
a,b // N by A1,A2,A10,A16,AFF_1:43,AFF_1:52;
then a9,c // N by A17,A18,AFF_1:32;
then A22: c in N by A3,A14,AFF_1:23;
then A23: b <> c by A2,A9,A10,AFF_1:45;
then A24: D is  being_line by AFF_1:def 3;
now
assume D <> Q;
then A25: c <> b9 by A7,A8,A12,A15,A24,A20,A21,AFF_1:18;
 LIN b9,c,a9 by A3,A4,A14,A22,AFF_1:21;
then consider q such that A26:  LIN b9,b,q and A27: c,b // a9,q by A25,CKB2:1;
a9,a // c,b by A19,AFF_1:4;
then a9,a // a9,q by A23,A27,AFF_1:5;
then  LIN a9,a,q by AFF_1:def 1;
then A28: q in P by A5,A6,A11,A13,AFF_1:25;
q in Q by A7,A8,A12,A15,A26,AFF_1:25;
hence (ex q st (q in P & q in Q)) by A28;

hence thesis by A5,A6,A7,A11,A12,A13,A19,A23,A21,AFF_1:38;

hence thesis by A5,A7;
