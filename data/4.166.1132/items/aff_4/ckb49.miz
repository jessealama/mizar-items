theorem
Th36: (for a holds (for A holds (A is  being_line implies (ex X st ((a in X & A c= X) & X is  being_plane)))))
proof
let a;
let A;
assume A1: A is  being_line;
then consider p,q such that A2: p in A and q in A and p <> q by AFF_1:19;
A3:now
consider b such that A4: (not b in A) by A1,CKB14:1;
consider P such that A5: (a in P & b in P) and A6: P is  being_line by CKB13:1;
set X = ( Plane (P,A) );
A7: A c= X by A6,CKB19:1;
assume A8: a in A;
then (not P // A) by A4,A5,AFF_1:45;
then X is  being_plane by A1,A6,CKB16:def 1;
hence thesis by A8,A7;
end;
now
consider P such that A9: a in P and A10: p in P and A11: P is  being_line by CKB13:1;
set X = ( Plane (P,A) );
A c= X by A11,CKB19:1;
then A12: P c= X by A2,A10,A11,CKB24:1,AFF_1:41;
assume (not a in A);
then (not P // A) by A2,A9,A10,AFF_1:45;
then X is  being_plane by A1,A11,CKB16:def 1;
hence thesis by A9,A11,A12,CKB19:1;
end;
hence thesis by A3;
