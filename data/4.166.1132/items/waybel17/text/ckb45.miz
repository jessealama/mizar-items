theorem
Th20: (for S,T being  complete LATTICE holds (for f being (Function of S,T) holds (for N being (net of S) holds (for j being (Element of N) holds (for j9 being (Element of ( f * N )) holds (j9 = j implies (f is  monotone implies ( f . ( "/\" ({ ( N . k ) where k is (Element of N): k >= j },S) ) ) <= ( "/\" ({ ( ( f * N ) . l ) where l is (Element of ( f * N )): l >= j9 },T) ))))))))
proof
let S being  complete LATTICE;
let T being  complete LATTICE;
let f being (Function of S,T);
let N being (net of S);
let j being (Element of N);
let j9 being (Element of ( f * N ));
assume A1: j9 = j;
assume A2: f is  monotone;
A3: ( dom f ) = (the carrier of S) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A4: ( the RelStr of ( f * N ) ) = ( the RelStr of N ) by WAYBEL_9:def 8;
A5: ( dom (the mapping of N) ) = (the carrier of N) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A6: { ( ( f * N ) . l ) where l is (Element of ( f * N )): l >= j9 } c= ( f .: { ( N . l1 ) where l1 is (Element of N): l1 >= j } )
proof
let s being set;
assume s in { ( ( f * N ) . l ) where l is (Element of ( f * N )): l >= j9 };
then consider x being (Element of ( f * N )) such that A7: s = ( ( f * N ) . x ) and A8: x >= j9;
reconsider x as (Element of N) by A4;
[ j9,x ] in (the InternalRel of ( f * N )) by A8,ORDERS_2:def 5;
then A9: x >= j by A1,A4,ORDERS_2:def 5;
A10: s = ( ( f * (the mapping of N) ) . x ) by A7,WAYBEL_9:def 8
.= ( f . ( N . x ) ) by A5,FUNCT_1:13;
( N . x ) in { ( N . z ) where z is (Element of N): z >= j } by A9;
hence thesis by A3,A10,FUNCT_1:def 6;
end;
A11: ( f .: { ( N . l1 ) where l1 is (Element of N): l1 >= j } ) c= { ( ( f * N ) . l ) where l is (Element of ( f * N )): l >= j9 }
proof
let s being set;
assume s in ( f .: { ( N . l1 ) where l1 is (Element of N): l1 >= j } );
then consider x being set such that x in ( dom f ) and A12: x in { ( N . l1 ) where l1 is (Element of N): l1 >= j } and A13: s = ( f . x ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
consider l2 being (Element of N) such that A14: x = ( N . l2 ) and A15: l2 >= j by A12;
reconsider l29 = l2 as (Element of ( f * N )) by A4;
A16: s = ( ( f * (the mapping of N) ) . l2 ) by A5,A13,A14,FUNCT_1:13
.= ( ( f * N ) . l29 ) by WAYBEL_9:def 8;
[ j,l2 ] in (the InternalRel of N) by A15,ORDERS_2:def 5;
then l29 >= j9 by A1,A4,ORDERS_2:def 5;
hence thesis by A16;
end;
set K = { ( N . k ) where k is (Element of N): k >= j };
K c= (the carrier of S)
proof
let r being set;
assume r in K;
then (ex f being (Element of N) st (r = ( N . f ) & f >= j));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider K as (Subset of S);
{ ( ( f * N ) . l ) where l is (Element of ( f * N )): l >= j9 } = ( f .: K ) by A6,A11,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by A2,CKB40:1;
