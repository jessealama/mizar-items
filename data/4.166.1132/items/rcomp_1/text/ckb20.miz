theorem
Th30: (for X holds (((X <> ( {} ) & X is  closed) & X is  bounded_above) implies ( upper_bound X ) in X))
proof
let X;
assume that
A1: X <> ( {} )
and
A2: X is  closed
and
A3: X is  bounded_above
and
A4: (not ( upper_bound X ) in X);
set s1 = ( upper_bound X );
defpred P[ (Element of ( NAT )),(Element of ( REAL )) ]
 means
(ex q st ((q = $2 & q in X) & ( s1 - q ) < ( 1 / ( $1 + 1 ) )));
A5: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (ex p being (Element of ( REAL )) st P[ n,p ]))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
( 0 ) < ( ( n + 1 ) " );
then ( 0 ) < ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ) by XCMPLX_1:215;
then consider t such that A6: t in X and A7: ( s1 - ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ) ) < t by A1,A3,SEQ_4:def 1;
take t;
s1 < ( t + ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ) ) by A7,XREAL_1:19;
then ( s1 - t ) < ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ) by XREAL_1:19;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
consider f being (Function of ( NAT ),( REAL )) such that A8: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ n,( f . n ) ]) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A5);
A9:now
let n;
(ex q st ((q = ( f . n ) & q in X) & ( s1 - q ) < ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ))) by A8;
hence (( f . n ) in X & ( s1 - ( f . n ) ) < ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ));
end;
A10: ( rng f ) c= X
proof
let x;
assume x in ( rng f );
then consider y such that A11: y in ( dom f ) and A12: x = ( f . y ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider y as (Element of ( NAT )) by A11,FUNCT_2:def 1;
( f . y ) in X by A9;
hence thesis by A12;
end;
A13:now
let s;
assume A14: ( 0 ) < s;
consider n such that A15: ( s " ) < n by SEQ_4:3;
take k = n;
let m;
assume k <= m;
then ( k + 1 ) <= ( m + 1 ) by XREAL_1:6;
then A16: ( 1 / ( m + 1 ) ) <= ( 1 / ( k + 1 ) ) by XREAL_1:118;
( f . m ) in X by A9;
then ( f . m ) <= s1 by A3,SEQ_4:def 1;
then A17: ( 0 ) <= ( s1 - ( f . m ) ) by XREAL_1:48;
( ( s " ) + ( 0 ) ) < ( n + 1 ) by A15,XREAL_1:8;
then ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ) < ( 1 / ( s " ) ) by A14,XREAL_1:76;
then ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ) < s by XCMPLX_1:216;
then ( 1 / ( m + 1 ) ) < s by A16,XXREAL_0:2;
then ( s1 - ( f . m ) ) < s by A9,XXREAL_0:2;
then ( abs ( - ( ( f . m ) - s1 ) ) ) < s by A17,ABSVALUE:def 1;
hence ( abs ( ( f . m ) - s1 ) ) < s by COMPLEX1:52;
end;
then A18: f is  convergent by SEQ_2:def 6;
then ( lim f ) = s1 by A13,SEQ_2:def 7;
hence contradiction by A2,A4,A18,A10,CKB7:def 1;
end;
