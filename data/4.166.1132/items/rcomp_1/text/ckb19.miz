theorem
(X is  bounded  closed implies X is  compact)
proof
assume that
A1: X is  bounded
and
A2: X is  closed;
now
let s1;
assume that
A3: ( rng s1 ) c= X;
A4: s1 is  bounded_below
proof
consider p such that A5: p is (LowerBound of X) by A1,XXREAL_2:def 9;
A6: (for q holds (q in X implies p <= q)) by A5,XXREAL_2:def 2;
take r = ( p - 1 );
A7: ( r + 1 ) = ( p - ( 1 - 1 ) );
A8: (for t holds (t in ( rng s1 ) implies r < t))
proof
let t;
assume t in ( rng s1 );
then A9: p <= t by A3,A6;
r < p by A7,XREAL_1:29;
hence thesis by A9,XXREAL_0:2;
end;
(for n holds r < ( s1 . n ))
proof
let n;
n in ( NAT );
then n in ( dom s1 ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( s1 . n ) in ( rng s1 ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A8;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
s1 is  bounded_above
proof
consider p such that A10: p is (UpperBound of X) by A1,XXREAL_2:def 10;
A11: (for q holds (q in X implies q <= p)) by A10,XXREAL_2:def 1;
take r = ( p + 1 );
A12: (for t holds (t in ( rng s1 ) implies t < r))
proof
let t;
assume t in ( rng s1 );
then A13: t <= p by A3,A11;
p < r by XREAL_1:29;
hence thesis by A13,XXREAL_0:2;
end;
(for n holds ( s1 . n ) < r)
proof
let n;
n in ( NAT );
then n in ( dom s1 ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( s1 . n ) in ( rng s1 ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A12;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
then s1 is  bounded by A4,SEQ_2:def 8;
then consider s2 being Real_Sequence such that A14: s2 is (subsequence of s1) and A15: s2 is  convergent by SEQ_4:40;
(ex Nseq st s2 = ( s1 * Nseq )) by A14,VALUED_0:def 17;
then ( rng s2 ) c= ( rng s1 ) by RELAT_1:26;
then ( rng s2 ) c= X by A3,XBOOLE_1:1;
then ( lim s2 ) in X by A2,A15,CKB7:def 1;
hence (ex s2 st ((s2 is (subsequence of s1) & s2 is  convergent) & ( lim s2 ) in X)) by A14,A15;
end;
hence thesis by CKB6:def 1;
end;
