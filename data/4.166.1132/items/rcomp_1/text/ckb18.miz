theorem
Th28: (X is  compact implies X is  bounded)
proof
assume A1: X is  compact;
assume A2: (not X is  bounded);
per cases  by A2;
suppose A3: (not X is  bounded_above);

defpred P[ (Element of ( NAT )),(Element of ( REAL )) ]
 means
(ex q st ((q = $2 & q in X) & $1 < q));
A4: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (ex p being (Element of ( REAL )) st P[ n,p ]))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
(not n is (UpperBound of X)) by A3,XXREAL_2:def 10;
then consider t being  ext-real number such that A5: (t in X & n < t) by XXREAL_2:def 1;
take t;
thus thesis by A5;
end;
consider f being (Function of ( NAT ),( REAL )) such that A6: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ n,( f . n ) ]) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A4);
A7:now
let n;
(ex q st ((q = ( f . n ) & q in X) & n < q)) by A6;
hence (( f . n ) in X & n < ( f . n ));
end;
A8: (for p holds (p in X implies (ex r st (ex n st (( 0 ) < r & (for m holds (n < m implies r < ( abs ( ( f . m ) - p ) ))))))))
proof
let p;
assume that
p in X;
consider q such that A9: q = 1;
take r = q;
consider k such that A10: ( p + 1 ) < k by SEQ_4:3;
take n = k;
thus ( 0 ) < r by A9;
let m;
assume n < m;
then ( p + 1 ) < m by A10,XXREAL_0:2;
then ( p + 1 ) < ( f . m ) by A7,XXREAL_0:2;
then 1 < ( ( f . m ) - p ) by XREAL_1:20;
hence thesis by A9,ABSVALUE:def 1;
end;
( rng f ) c= X
proof
let x;
assume x in ( rng f );
then consider y such that A11: y in ( dom f ) and A12: x = ( f . y ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider y as (Element of ( NAT )) by A11,FUNCT_2:def 1;
( f . y ) in X by A7;
hence thesis by A12;
end;
then (ex s2 st ((s2 is (subsequence of f) & s2 is  convergent) & ( lim s2 ) in X)) by A1,CKB6:def 1;
hence contradiction by A8,CKB17:1;
end;
suppose A13: (not X is  bounded_below);

defpred P[ (Element of ( NAT )),(Element of ( REAL )) ]
 means
(ex q st ((q = $2 & q in X) & q < ( - $1 )));
A14: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (ex p being (Element of ( REAL )) st P[ n,p ]))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
(not ( - n ) is (LowerBound of X)) by A13,XXREAL_2:def 9;
then consider t being  ext-real number such that A15: (t in X & t < ( - n )) by XXREAL_2:def 2;
take t;
thus thesis by A15;
end;
consider f being (Function of ( NAT ),( REAL )) such that A16: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ n,( f . n ) ]) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A14);
A17:now
let n;
(ex q st ((q = ( f . n ) & q in X) & q < ( - n ))) by A16;
hence (( f . n ) in X & ( f . n ) < ( - n ));
end;
A18: (for p holds (p in X implies (ex r st (ex n st (( 0 ) < r & (for m holds (n < m implies r < ( abs ( ( f . m ) - p ) ))))))))
proof
let p;
assume that
p in X;
consider q such that A19: q = 1;
take r = q;
consider k such that A20: ( abs ( p - 1 ) ) < k by SEQ_4:3;
take n = k;
thus ( 0 ) < r by A19;
let m;
assume n < m;
then A21: ( - m ) < ( - n ) by XREAL_1:24;
( - k ) < ( p - 1 ) by A20,SEQ_2:1;
then ( - m ) < ( p - 1 ) by A21,XXREAL_0:2;
then ( f . m ) < ( p - 1 ) by A17,XXREAL_0:2;
then ( ( f . m ) + 1 ) < p by XREAL_1:20;
then 1 < ( p - ( f . m ) ) by XREAL_1:20;
then r < ( abs ( - ( ( f . m ) - p ) ) ) by A19,ABSVALUE:def 1;
hence thesis by COMPLEX1:52;
end;
( rng f ) c= X
proof
let x;
assume x in ( rng f );
then consider y such that A22: y in ( dom f ) and A23: x = ( f . y ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider y as (Element of ( NAT )) by A22,FUNCT_2:def 1;
( f . y ) in X by A17;
hence thesis by A23;
end;
then (ex s2 st ((s2 is (subsequence of f) & s2 is  convergent) & ( lim s2 ) in X)) by A1,CKB6:def 1;
hence contradiction by A18,CKB17:1;
