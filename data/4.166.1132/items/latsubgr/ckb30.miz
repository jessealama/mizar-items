let G2 being Group;

existence
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(for H being  strict (Subgroup of G1) holds (H = $1 implies (for A being (Subset of G2) holds (A = ( f .: (the carrier of H) ) implies $2 = ( gr ( f .: (the carrier of H) ) )))));
A1: (for e being set holds (e in (the carrier of ( lattice G1 )) implies (ex u being set st (u in (the carrier of ( lattice G2 )) & P[ e,u ]))))
proof
let e being set;
assume e in (the carrier of ( lattice G1 ));
then reconsider E = e as  strict (Subgroup of G1) by GROUP_3:def 1;
reconsider u = ( gr ( f .: (the carrier of E) ) ) as  strict (Subgroup of G2);
reconsider u as (Element of ( lattice G2 )) by GROUP_3:def 1;
take u;
thus thesis;

consider f1 being (Function of (the carrier of ( lattice G1 )),(the carrier of ( lattice G2 ))) such that A2: (for e being set holds (e in (the carrier of ( lattice G1 )) implies P[ e,( f1 . e ) ])) from FUNCT_2:sch 1(A1);
take f1;
let H being  strict (Subgroup of G1);
let A being (Subset of G2);
A3: H in (the carrier of ( lattice G1 )) by GROUP_3:def 1;
assume A = ( f .: (the carrier of H) );
hence thesis by A2,A3;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let f1 being (Function of (the carrier of ( lattice G1 )),(the carrier of ( lattice G2 ))),f2 being (Function of (the carrier of ( lattice G1 )),(the carrier of ( lattice G2 )));
assume that
A4: (for H being  strict (Subgroup of G1) holds (for A being (Subset of G2) holds (A = ( f .: (the carrier of H) ) implies ( f1 . H ) = ( gr A ))))
and
A5: (for H being  strict (Subgroup of G1) holds (for A being (Subset of G2) holds (A = ( f .: (the carrier of H) ) implies ( f2 . H ) = ( gr A ))));
(for h being set holds (h in (the carrier of ( lattice G1 )) implies ( f1 . h ) = ( f2 . h )))
proof
let h being set;
assume h in (the carrier of ( lattice G1 ));
then reconsider H = h as  strict (Subgroup of G1) by GROUP_3:def 1;
thus ( f1 . h ) = ( gr ( f .: (the carrier of H) ) ) by A4
.= ( f2 . h ) by A5;
end;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:12;
