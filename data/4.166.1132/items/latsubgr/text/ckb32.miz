theorem
(for G1,G2 being Group holds (for f being (Homomorphism of G1,G2) holds (f is  one-to-one implies ( FuncLatt f ) is  one-to-one)))
proof
let G1 being Group;
let G2 being Group;
let f being (Homomorphism of G1,G2);
assume that
A1: f is  one-to-one;
(for x1,x2 being set holds (((x1 in ( dom ( FuncLatt f ) ) & x2 in ( dom ( FuncLatt f ) )) & ( ( FuncLatt f ) . x1 ) = ( ( FuncLatt f ) . x2 )) implies x1 = x2))
proof
reconsider y = ( f . ( 1_ G1 ) ) as (Element of G2);
let x1 being set;

assume that
A2: (x1 in ( dom ( FuncLatt f ) ) & x2 in ( dom ( FuncLatt f ) ))

A4: (for g being (Element of G2) holds (g in ( f .: (the carrier of x1) ) implies ( g " ) in ( f .: (the carrier of x1) )))
proof
let g being (Element of G2);
assume g in ( f .: (the carrier of x1) );
then consider x being (Element of G1) such that A5: x in (the carrier of x1) and A6: g = ( f . x ) by FUNCT_2:65;
