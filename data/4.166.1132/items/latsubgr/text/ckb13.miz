definition
let G being Group;
func carr G -> (Function of ( Subgroups G ),( bool (the carrier of G) ))
means
:Def1: (for H being  strict (Subgroup of G) holds ( it . H ) = (the carrier of H));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(for h being  strict (Subgroup of G) holds (h = $1 implies $2 = (the carrier of h)));
A1: (for e being set holds (e in ( Subgroups G ) implies (ex u being set st (u in ( bool (the carrier of G) ) & P[ e,u ]))))
proof
let e being set;
assume e in ( Subgroups G );
then reconsider E = e as  strict (Subgroup of G) by GROUP_3:def 1;
reconsider u = ( carr E ) as (Subset of G);
take u;
thus thesis by GROUP_2:def 9;
end;
consider f being (Function of ( Subgroups G ),( bool (the carrier of G) )) such that A2: (for e being set holds (e in ( Subgroups G ) implies P[ e,( f . e ) ])) from FUNCT_2:sch 1(A1);
take f;
let H being  strict (Subgroup of G);
H in ( Subgroups G ) by GROUP_3:def 1;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let F1 being (Function of ( Subgroups G ),( bool (the carrier of G) )),F2 being (Function of ( Subgroups G ),( bool (the carrier of G) ));
assume that
A3: (for H1 being  strict (Subgroup of G) holds ( F1 . H1 ) = (the carrier of H1))
and
A4: (for H2 being  strict (Subgroup of G) holds ( F2 . H2 ) = (the carrier of H2));
(for h being set holds (h in ( Subgroups G ) implies ( F1 . h ) = ( F2 . h )))
proof
let h being set;
assume h in ( Subgroups G );
then reconsider H = h as  strict (Subgroup of G) by GROUP_3:def 1;
thus ( F1 . h ) = (the carrier of H) by A3
.= ( F2 . h ) by A4;
end;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:12;
