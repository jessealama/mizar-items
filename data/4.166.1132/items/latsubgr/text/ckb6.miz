theorem
(for G1,G2 being Group holds (for f being (Homomorphism of G1,G2) holds (for H1 being (Subgroup of G1) holds (ex H2 being  strict (Subgroup of G2) st (the carrier of H2) = ( f .: (the carrier of H1) )))))
proof
let G1 being Group;
let G2 being Group;
let f being (Homomorphism of G1,G2);
let H1 being (Subgroup of G1);
reconsider y = ( f . ( 1_ G1 ) ) as (Element of G2);
A1: (for g being (Element of G2) holds (g in ( f .: (the carrier of H1) ) implies ( g " ) in ( f .: (the carrier of H1) )))
proof
let g being (Element of G2);
assume g in ( f .: (the carrier of H1) );
then consider x being (Element of G1) such that A2: x in (the carrier of H1) and A3: g = ( f . x ) by FUNCT_2:65;
x in H1 by A2,STRUCT_0:def 5;
then ( x " ) in H1 by GROUP_2:51;
then A4: ( x " ) in (the carrier of H1) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
( f . ( x " ) ) = ( ( f . x ) " ) by GROUP_6:32;
hence thesis by A3,A4,FUNCT_2:35;
end;
A5: (for g1,g2 being (Element of G2) holds ((g1 in ( f .: (the carrier of H1) ) & g2 in ( f .: (the carrier of H1) )) implies ( g1 * g2 ) in ( f .: (the carrier of H1) )))
proof
let g1 being (Element of G2);
let g2 being (Element of G2);
assume that
A6: g1 in ( f .: (the carrier of H1) )
and
A7: g2 in ( f .: (the carrier of H1) );
consider x being (Element of G1) such that A8: x in (the carrier of H1) and A9: g1 = ( f . x ) by A6,FUNCT_2:65;
consider y being (Element of G1) such that A10: y in (the carrier of H1) and A11: g2 = ( f . y ) by A7,FUNCT_2:65;
A12: y in H1 by A10,STRUCT_0:def 5;
x in H1 by A8,STRUCT_0:def 5;
then ( x * y ) in H1 by A12,GROUP_2:50;
then A13: ( x * y ) in (the carrier of H1) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
( f . ( x * y ) ) = ( ( f . x ) * ( f . y ) ) by GROUP_6:def 6;
hence thesis by A9,A11,A13,FUNCT_2:35;
end;
( 1_ G1 ) in H1 by GROUP_2:46;
then (( dom f ) = (the carrier of G1) & ( 1_ G1 ) in (the carrier of H1)) by FUNCT_2:def 1,STRUCT_0:def 5;
then y in ( f .: (the carrier of H1) ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
then consider H2 being  strict (Subgroup of G2) such that A14: (the carrier of H2) = ( f .: (the carrier of H1) ) by A1,A5,GROUP_2:52;
take H2;
thus thesis by A14;
