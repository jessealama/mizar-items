theorem
(for G1,G2 being Group holds (for f being (Homomorphism of G1,G2) holds (for H2 being (Subgroup of G2) holds (ex H1 being  strict (Subgroup of G1) st (the carrier of H1) = ( f " (the carrier of H2) )))))
proof
let G1 being Group,G2 being Group;
let f being (Homomorphism of G1,G2);
let H2 being (Subgroup of G2);
A1: (for g being (Element of G1) holds (g in ( f " (the carrier of H2) ) implies ( g " ) in ( f " (the carrier of H2) )))
proof
let g being (Element of G1);
assume g in ( f " (the carrier of H2) );
then ( f . g ) in (the carrier of H2) by FUNCT_2:38;
then ( f . g ) in H2 by STRUCT_0:def 5;
then ( ( f . g ) " ) in H2 by GROUP_2:51;
then ( f . ( g " ) ) in H2 by GROUP_6:32;
then ( f . ( g " ) ) in (the carrier of H2) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:38;
end;
A2: (for g1,g2 being (Element of G1) holds ((g1 in ( f " (the carrier of H2) ) & g2 in ( f " (the carrier of H2) )) implies ( g1 * g2 ) in ( f " (the carrier of H2) )))
proof
let g1 being (Element of G1),g2 being (Element of G1);
assume that
A3: g1 in ( f " (the carrier of H2) )
and
A4: g2 in ( f " (the carrier of H2) );
( f . g2 ) in (the carrier of H2) by A4,FUNCT_2:38;
then A5: ( f . g2 ) in H2 by STRUCT_0:def 5;
( f . g1 ) in (the carrier of H2) by A3,FUNCT_2:38;
then ( f . g1 ) in H2 by STRUCT_0:def 5;
then ( ( f . g1 ) * ( f . g2 ) ) in H2 by A5,GROUP_2:50;
then ( f . ( g1 * g2 ) ) in H2 by GROUP_6:def 6;
then ( f . ( g1 * g2 ) ) in (the carrier of H2) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:38;
end;
( 1_ G2 ) in H2 by GROUP_2:46;
then ( 1_ G2 ) in (the carrier of H2) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
then ( f . ( 1_ G1 ) ) in (the carrier of H2) by GROUP_6:31;
then ( f " (the carrier of H2) ) <> ( {} ) by FUNCT_2:38;
then consider H1 being  strict (Subgroup of G1) such that A6: (the carrier of H1) = ( f " (the carrier of H2) ) by A1,A2,GROUP_2:52;
take H1;
thus thesis by A6;
