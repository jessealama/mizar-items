theorem
(for G1,G2 being Group holds (for f being (Homomorphism of G1,G2) holds (for H1,H2 being (Subgroup of G2) holds (for H3,H4 being (Subgroup of G1) holds (((the carrier of H3) = ( f " (the carrier of H1) ) & (the carrier of H4) = ( f " (the carrier of H2) )) implies (H1 is (Subgroup of H2) implies H3 is (Subgroup of H4)))))))
proof
let G1 being Group,G2 being Group;
let f being (Homomorphism of G1,G2);
let H1 being (Subgroup of G2),H2 being (Subgroup of G2);
let H3 being (Subgroup of G1),H4 being (Subgroup of G1);
assume that
A1: ((the carrier of H3) = ( f " (the carrier of H1) ) & (the carrier of H4) = ( f " (the carrier of H2) ));
assume H1 is (Subgroup of H2);
then (the carrier of H1) c= (the carrier of H2) by GROUP_2:def 5;
hence thesis by A1,GROUP_2:57,RELAT_1:143;
