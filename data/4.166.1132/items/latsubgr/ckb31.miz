theorem
(for G being Group holds ( FuncLatt ( id (the carrier of G) ) ) = ( id (the carrier of ( lattice G )) ))
proof
let G being Group;
set f = ( id (the carrier of G) );
A1: (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of ( lattice G )) implies ( ( FuncLatt f ) . x ) = x))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of ( lattice G ));
then reconsider x as  strict (Subgroup of G) by GROUP_3:def 1;
A2: (the carrier of x) c= ( f .: (the carrier of x) )
proof
let z being set;
assume A3: z in (the carrier of x);
(the carrier of x) c= (the carrier of G) by GROUP_2:def 5;
then reconsider z as (Element of G) by A3;
( f . z ) = z by FUNCT_1:17;
hence thesis by A3,FUNCT_2:35;
end;
A4: ( f .: (the carrier of x) ) c= (the carrier of x)
proof
let z being set;
assume A5: z in ( f .: (the carrier of x) );
then reconsider z as (Element of G);
(ex Z being (Element of G) st (Z in (the carrier of x) & z = ( f . Z ))) by A5,FUNCT_2:65;
hence thesis by FUNCT_1:17;
end;
then reconsider X = (the carrier of x) as (Subset of G) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
( f .: (the carrier of x) ) = (the carrier of x) by A4,A2,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then ( ( FuncLatt f ) . x ) = ( gr X ) by CKB30:def 1;
hence thesis by CKB3:1;
end;
( dom ( FuncLatt f ) ) = (the carrier of ( lattice G )) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence thesis by A1,FUNCT_1:17;
end;
