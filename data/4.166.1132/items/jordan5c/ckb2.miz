proof
consider EX being (Point of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) such that A3: EX in ( P /\ Q ) and A4: (ex g being (Function of ( I[01] ),( ( TOP-REAL 2 ) | P )) st (ex s2 being Real st ((((((g is  being_homeomorphism & ( g .

then (for g being (Function of ( I[01] ),( ( TOP-REAL 2 ) | P )) holds (for s2 being Real holds ((((((g is  being_homeomorphism & ( g .
