existence
proof
consider EX being (Point of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) such that A3: EX in ( P /\ Q ) and A4: (ex g being (Function of ( I[01] ),( ( TOP-REAL 2 ) | P )) st (ex s2 being Real st ((((((g is  being_homeomorphism & ( g .

EX in P by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then (for g being (Function of ( I[01] ),( ( TOP-REAL 2 ) | P )) holds (for s2 being Real holds ((((((g is  being_homeomorphism & ( g .

consider g being (Function of ( I[01] ),( ( TOP-REAL 2 ) | P )) such that A10: g is  being_homeomorphism and A11: (( g . ( 0 ) ) = p1 & ( g . 1 ) = p2) by A2,TOPREAL1:def 1;
A12: ( rng g ) = ( [#] ( ( TOP-REAL 2 ) | P ) ) by A10,TOPS_2:def 5
.= P by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
then consider ss1 being set such that A13: ss1 in ( dom g ) and A14: ( g . ss1 ) = IT1 by A5,A6,FUNCT_1:def 3;
A15: ( dom g ) = ( [#] ( I[01] ) ) by A10,TOPS_2:def 5

A21: ss2 <= 1 by A18,BORSUK_1:43;

suppose ss1 < ss2;
