reserve k for (Element of ( NAT ));
reserve f for non constant  standard special_circular_sequence;
theorem
((1 <= k & ( k + 1 ) <= ( len f )) implies ( Int ( right_cell (f,k) ) ) misses ( L~ f ))
proof
assume that
A1: 1 <= k
and
A2: ( k + 1 ) <= ( len f );
k <= ( k + 1 ) by NAT_1:11;
then k <= ( len f ) by A2,XXREAL_0:2;
then A3: k in ( dom f ) by A1,FINSEQ_3:25;
then consider i1 being (Element of ( NAT )),j1 being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A4: [ i1,j1 ] in ( Indices ( GoB f ) ) and A5: ( f /. k ) = ( ( GoB f ) * (i1,j1) ) by GOBOARD2:14;
A6: i1 <= ( len ( GoB f ) ) by A4,MATRIX_1:38;
j1 <> ( 0 ) by A4,MATRIX_1:38;
then consider j being Nat such that A7: j1 = ( j + 1 ) by NAT_1:6;
i1 <> ( 0 ) by A4,MATRIX_1:38;
then consider i being Nat such that A8: i1 = ( i + 1 ) by NAT_1:6;
i <= i1 by A8,NAT_1:11;
then A9: i <= ( len ( GoB f ) ) by A6,XXREAL_0:2;
A10: j1 <= ( width ( GoB f ) ) by A4,MATRIX_1:38;
( k + 1 ) >= 1 by NAT_1:11;
then A11: ( k + 1 ) in ( dom f ) by A2,FINSEQ_3:25;
then consider i2 being (Element of ( NAT )),j2 being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A12: [ i2,j2 ] in ( Indices ( GoB f ) ) and A13: ( f /. ( k + 1 ) ) = ( ( GoB f ) * (i2,j2) ) by GOBOARD2:14;
reconsider i19 = i1,i29 = i2,j19 = j1,j29 = j2 as (Element of ( REAL )) by XREAL_0:def 1;
( ( abs ( i1 - i2 ) ) + ( abs ( j1 - j2 ) ) ) = 1 by A3,A4,A5,A11,A12,A13,GOBOARD5:12;
then A14: ((( abs ( i19 - i29 ) ) = 1 & j1 = j2) or (( abs ( j19 - j29 ) ) = 1 & i1 = i2)) by SEQM_3:42;
reconsider i,j as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
A15: i1 = ( i + 1 ) by A8;
A16: j1 = ( j + 1 ) by A7;
A17: j2 <= ( width ( GoB f ) ) by A12,MATRIX_1:38;
A18: i2 <= ( len ( GoB f ) ) by A12,MATRIX_1:38;
j <= j1 by A7,NAT_1:11;
then A19: j <= ( width ( GoB f ) ) by A10,XXREAL_0:2;
per cases  by A14,SEQM_3:41;
suppose (i1 = i2 & ( j1 + 1 ) = j2);

then ( right_cell (f,k) ) = ( cell (( GoB f ),i1,j1) ) by A1,A2,A4,A5,A15,A12,A13,GOBOARD5:27;
hence thesis by A6,A10,GOBOARD7:12;
end;
suppose (( i1 + 1 ) = i2 & j1 = j2);

then ( right_cell (f,k) ) = ( cell (( GoB f ),i1,j) ) by A1,A2,A4,A5,A7,A12,A13,GOBOARD5:28;
hence thesis by A6,A19,GOBOARD7:12;
