theorem
Th16: (FS is  c=-linear implies ( union FS ) is (Filter of X))
proof
A1: (for S being set holds (S in FS implies S c= ( bool X )))
proof
let S being set;
assume S in FS;
then S is (Element of ( Filters X ));
hence thesis;
end;
consider S being set such that A2: S in FS by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
assume A3: FS is  c=-linear;
A4: (for Y1 holds (for Y2 holds (((Y1 in ( union FS ) & Y2 in ( union FS )) implies ( Y1 /\ Y2 ) in ( union FS )) & ((Y1 in ( union FS ) & Y1 c= Y2) implies Y2 in ( union FS )))))
proof
let Y1;
let Y2;
thus ((Y1 in ( union FS ) & Y2 in ( union FS )) implies ( Y1 /\ Y2 ) in ( union FS ))
proof
assume that
A5: Y1 in ( union FS )
and
A6: Y2 in ( union FS );
consider S1 being set such that A7: Y1 in S1 and A8: S1 in FS by A5,TARSKI:def 4;
A9: S1 is (Filter of X) by A8,CKB30:1;
consider S2 being set such that A10: Y2 in S2 and A11: S2 in FS by A6,TARSKI:def 4;
A12: S1,S2 are_c=-comparable  by A3,A8,A11,ORDINAL1:def 8;
A13: S2 is (Filter of X) by A11,CKB30:1;
per cases  by A12,XBOOLE_0:def 9;
suppose S1 c= S2;

then ( Y1 /\ Y2 ) in S2 by A7,A10,A13,CKB4:def 1;
hence thesis by A11,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
suppose S2 c= S1;

then ( Y1 /\ Y2 ) in S1 by A7,A10,A9,CKB4:def 1;
hence thesis by A8,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
end;

assume that
A14: Y1 in ( union FS )
and
A15: Y1 c= Y2;
consider S1 being set such that A16: Y1 in S1 and A17: S1 in FS by A14,TARSKI:def 4;
S1 is (Filter of X) by A17,CKB30:1;
then Y2 in S1 by A15,A16,CKB4:def 1;
hence thesis by A17,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
A18: (not ( {} ) in ( union FS ))
proof
assume ( {} ) in ( union FS );
then consider S being set such that A19: ( {} ) in S and A20: S in FS by TARSKI:def 4;
S is (Filter of X) by A20,CKB30:1;
hence contradiction by A19,CKB4:def 1;
end;
S is (Filter of X) by A2,CKB30:1;
then X in S by CKB7:1;
then ( union FS ) is non empty non empty (Subset-Family of X) by A1,A2,TARSKI:def 4,ZFMISC_1:76;
hence thesis by A18,A4,CKB4:def 1;
end;
