provided
A1: (for t being (Element of A()) holds (t in x() implies (ex ff being (Element of B()) st P[ t,ff ])))
proof
set b = the (Element of B());
set M = { { ff where ff is (Element of B()): P[ tt,ff ] } where tt is (Element of A()): tt in x() };
set f = the (Function of A(),B());
assume A2: (not thesis);
then consider t being (Element of A()) such that A3: t in x() and (not P[ t,( f . t ) ]);
{ ff where ff is (Element of B()): P[ t,ff ] } in M by A3;
then reconsider M as non  empty set;
now
let X;
assume X in M;
then consider t being (Element of A()) such that A4: X = { ff where ff is (Element of B()): P[ t,ff ] } and A5: t in x();
consider ff being (Element of B()) such that A6: P[ t,ff ] by A1,A5;
ff in X by A4,A6;
hence X <> ( {} );
end;
then consider Choice being Function such that ( dom Choice ) = M and A7: (X in M implies ( Choice . X ) in X) by FUNCT_1:111;
defpred Q[ (Element of A()),set ]
 means
(($1 in x() implies $2 = ( Choice . { ff where ff is (Element of B()): P[ $1,ff ] } )) & ($1 in x() or $2 = b));
A8:now
let t being (Element of A());
A9:now
set s = { ff where ff is (Element of B()): P[ t,ff ] };
assume t in x();
then s in M;
then ( Choice . s ) in s by A7;
then (ex ff being (Element of B()) st (( Choice . s ) = ff & P[ t,ff ]));
hence ( Choice . s ) is (Element of B());
end;
(t in x() implies t in x());
hence (ex y being (Element of B()) st Q[ t,y ]) by A9;
end;
consider f being (Function of A(),B()) such that A10: (for x being (Element of A()) holds Q[ x,( f . x ) ]) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A8);
now
let t being (Element of A());
assume A11: t in x();
then A12: { ff where ff is (Element of B()): P[ t,ff ] } in M;
( f . t ) = ( Choice . { ff where ff is (Element of B()): P[ t,ff ] } ) by A10,A11;
then ( f . t ) in { ff where ff is (Element of B()): P[ t,ff ] } by A7,A12;
then (ex ff being (Element of B()) st (( f . t ) = ff & P[ t,ff ]));
hence P[ t,( f . t ) ];
end;
hence contradiction by A2;
