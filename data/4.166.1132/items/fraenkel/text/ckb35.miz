begin
reserve x for set;
scheme FraenkelFin9 { A,B() -> non empty set,X() -> set,P[set,set] } : { x where x is (Element of B()): (ex w being (Element of A()) st (P[ w,x ] & w in X())) } is  finite
provided
A1: X() is  finite
and
A2: (for w being (Element of A()) holds (for x,y being (Element of B()) holds ((P[ w,x ] & P[ w,y ]) implies x = y)))
proof
set M = { x where x is (Element of B()): (ex w being (Element of A()) st (P[ w,x ] & w in X())) };
defpred Q[ set,set ]
 means
((P[ $1,$2 ] & $1 in X()) & $2 in B());
A3: (for x,y being set holds ((x in A() & Q[ x,y ]) implies y in B()));
A4: (for x,y1,y2 being set holds (((x in A() & Q[ x,y1 ]) & Q[ x,y2 ]) implies y1 = y2)) by A2;
consider f being (PartFunc of A(),B()) such that A5: (for x holds (x in ( dom f ) iff (x in A() & (ex y being set st Q[ x,y ])))) and A6: (for x holds (x in ( dom f ) implies Q[ x,( f . x ) ])) from PARTFUN1:sch 2(A3,A4);
M = ( f .: X() )
proof
thus M c= ( f .: X() )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in M;
then consider u being (Element of B()) such that A7: x = u and A8: (ex w being (Element of A()) st (P[ w,u ] & w in X()));
consider w being (Element of A()) such that A9: P[ w,u ] and A10: w in X() by A8;
A11: w in ( dom f ) by A5,A9,A10;
then Q[ w,( f . w ) ] by A6;
then ( f . w ) = x by A2,A7,A9;
hence thesis by A10,A11,FUNCT_1:def 6;
end;

let x being set;
assume x in ( f .: X() );
then consider y being set such that A12: y in ( dom f ) and A13: y in X() and A14: x = ( f . y ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
reconsider x as (Element of B()) by A6,A12,A14;
P[ y,x ] by A6,A12,A14;
hence thesis by A12,A13;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
