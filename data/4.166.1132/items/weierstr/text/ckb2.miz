theorem
Th2: (for M being MetrSpace holds (for n being Nat holds (for F being (Subset-Family of M) holds (for p being FinSequence holds (((F is  being_ball-family & ( rng p ) = F) & ( dom p ) = ( Seg ( n + 1 ) )) implies (ex G being (Subset-Family of M) st ((G is  finite & G is  being_ball-family) & (ex q being FinSequence st ((( rng q ) = G & ( dom q ) = ( Seg n )) & (ex x being (Point of M) st (ex r being Real st ( union F ) c= ( ( union G ) \/ ( Ball (x,r) ) ))))))))))))
proof
let M being MetrSpace;
let n being Nat;
let F being (Subset-Family of M);
let p being FinSequence;
assume that
A1: F is  being_ball-family
and
A2: ( rng p ) = F
and
A3: ( dom p ) = ( Seg ( n + 1 ) );
( n + 1 ) in ( dom p ) by A3,FINSEQ_1:4;
then ( p . ( n + 1 ) ) in F by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then consider x being (Point of M) such that A4: (ex r being Real st ( p . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( Ball (x,r) )) by A1,TOPMETR:def 4;
consider r being Real such that A5: ( p . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( Ball (x,r) ) by A4;
reconsider q = ( p | ( Seg n ) ) as FinSequence by FINSEQ_1:15;
A6: ( rng q ) c= ( rng p ) by RELAT_1:70;
then reconsider G = ( rng q ) as (Subset-Family of M) by A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
reconsider G as (Subset-Family of M);
( len p ) = ( n + 1 ) by A3,FINSEQ_1:def 3;
then n <= ( len p ) by NAT_1:11;
then A7: ( dom q ) = ( Seg n ) by FINSEQ_1:17;
then A8: ( ( dom q ) \/ { ( n + 1 ) } ) = ( dom p ) by A3,FINSEQ_1:9;
A9: (ex x being (Point of M) st (ex r being Real st ( union F ) c= ( ( union G ) \/ ( Ball (x,r) ) )))
proof
take x;
take r;
( union F ) c= ( ( union G ) \/ ( Ball (x,r) ) )
proof
let t being set;
assume t in ( union F );
then consider A being set such that A10: t in A and A11: A in F by TARSKI:def 4;
consider s being set such that A12: s in ( dom p ) and A13: A = ( p . s ) by A2,A11,FUNCT_1:def 3;
now
per cases  by A8,A12,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
case s in ( dom q );
then (( q . s ) in G & ( q . s ) = A) by A13,FUNCT_1:47,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then A14: t in ( union G ) by A10,TARSKI:def 4;
( union G ) c= ( ( union G ) \/ ( Ball (x,r) ) ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
hence thesis by A14;
end;
case s in { ( n + 1 ) };
then ( p . s ) = ( Ball (x,r) ) by A5,TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A10,A13,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
take G;
(for x being set holds (x in G implies (ex y being (Point of M) st (ex r being Real st x = ( Ball (y,r) ))))) by A1,A2,A6,TOPMETR:def 4;
hence thesis by A7,A9,TOPMETR:def 4;
end;
