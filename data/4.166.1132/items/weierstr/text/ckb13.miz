theorem
Th18: (for P being (Subset of ( R^1 )) holds (P is  compact implies ( [#] P ) is  closed))
proof
let P being (Subset of ( R^1 ));
assume A1: P is  compact;
now
per cases ;
case A2: ( [#] P ) <> ( {} );
A3: ( R^1 ) is  T_2 by PCOMPS_1:34,TOPMETR:def 6;
(for s1 being Real_Sequence holds ((( rng s1 ) c= ( [#] P ) & s1 is  convergent) implies ( lim s1 ) in ( [#] P )))
proof
let s1 being Real_Sequence;
assume that
A4: ( rng s1 ) c= ( [#] P )
and
A5: s1 is  convergent;
set x = ( lim s1 );
reconsider x as (Point of ( R^1 )) by TOPMETR:17;
thus ( lim s1 ) in ( [#] P )
proof
assume (not ( lim s1 ) in ( [#] P ));
then x in ( P ` ) by SUBSET_1:29;
then consider Otx,OtP being (Subset of ( R^1 )) such that A6: Otx is  open and OtP is  open and A7: x in Otx and A8: (P c= OtP & Otx misses OtP) by A1,A2,A3,COMPTS_1:6;
A9: ( R^1 ) = TopStruct (# (the carrier of ( RealSpace )),( Family_open_set ( RealSpace ) ) #) by PCOMPS_1:def 5,TOPMETR:def 6;
then reconsider x as (Point of ( RealSpace ));
consider r being  real number such that A10: r > ( 0 ) and A11: ( Ball (x,r) ) c= Otx by A6,A7,TOPMETR:15,TOPMETR:def 6;
reconsider r as Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
A12: ( Ball (x,r) ) = { q where q is (Element of ( RealSpace )): ( dist (x,q) ) < r } by METRIC_1:17;
( rng s1 ) misses Otx by A4,A8,XBOOLE_1:1,XBOOLE_1:63;
then A13: ( Ball (x,r) ) misses ( rng s1 ) by A11,XBOOLE_1:63;
(not (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n <= m implies ( abs ( ( s1 . m ) - ( lim s1 ) ) ) < r))))
proof
given n being (Element of ( NAT )) such that
A14: (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n <= m implies ( abs ( ( s1 . m ) - ( lim s1 ) ) ) < r));

set m = ( n + 1 );
( abs ( ( s1 . m ) - ( lim s1 ) ) ) < r by A14,NAT_1:11;
then ( ( real_dist ) . (( s1 . m ),( lim s1 )) ) < r by METRIC_1:def 12;
then A15: ( ( real_dist ) . (( lim s1 ),( s1 . m )) ) < r by METRIC_1:9;
reconsider y = ( s1 . m ) as (Element of ( RealSpace )) by A9,TOPMETR:17;
A16: ( s1 . m ) in ( rng s1 ) by FUNCT_2:4;
( dist (x,y) ) = ( (the distance of ( RealSpace )) . (x,y) ) by METRIC_1:def 1;
then y in ( Ball (x,r) ) by A12,A15,METRIC_1:def 13;
then y in ( ( Ball (x,r) ) /\ ( rng s1 ) ) by A16,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by A13,XBOOLE_0:def 7;

hence thesis by A5,A10,SEQ_2:def 7;

hence thesis by RCOMP_1:def 4;
end;
case A17: ( [#] P ) = ( {} );

and
s1 is  convergent;
(ex x being set st x in ( NAT )) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
