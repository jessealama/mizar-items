theorem
Th3: (for M being MetrSpace holds (for F being (Subset-Family of M) holds ((F is  finite & F is  being_ball-family) implies (ex x being (Point of M) st (ex r being Real st ( union F ) c= ( Ball (x,r) ))))))
proof
let M being MetrSpace;
let F being (Subset-Family of M);
assume that
A1: F is  finite
and
A2: F is  being_ball-family;
consider p being FinSequence such that A3: ( rng p ) = F by A1,FINSEQ_1:52;
A4: (for F being (Subset-Family of M) holds ((F is  finite & F is  being_ball-family) implies (for n being Nat holds (for p being FinSequence holds ((( rng p ) = F & ( dom p ) = ( Seg n )) implies (ex x being (Point of M) st (ex r being Real st ( union F ) c= ( Ball (x,r) ))))))))
proof
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
(for F being (Subset-Family of M) holds ((F is  finite & F is  being_ball-family) implies (for n being Nat holds (n = $1 implies (for p being FinSequence holds ((( rng p ) = F & ( dom p ) = ( Seg n )) implies (ex x being (Point of M) st (ex r being Real st ( union F ) c= ( Ball (x,r) )))))))));
A5: (for k being Nat holds (P[ k ] implies P[ ( k + 1 ) ]))
proof
let k being Nat;
assume A6: P[ k ];
let F being (Subset-Family of M);
assume that
F is  finite
and
A7: F is  being_ball-family;
let n being Nat;
assume A8: n = ( k + 1 );
let p being FinSequence;
assume (( rng p ) = F & ( dom p ) = ( Seg n ));
then consider F1 being (Subset-Family of M) such that A9: (F1 is  finite & F1 is  being_ball-family) and A10: (ex p1 being FinSequence st ((( rng p1 ) = F1 & ( dom p1 ) = ( Seg k )) & (ex x2 being (Point of M) st (ex r2 being Real st ( union F ) c= ( ( union F1 ) \/ ( Ball (x2,r2) ) ))))) by A7,A8,CKB2:1;
consider x1 being (Point of M) such that A11: (ex r being Real st ( union F1 ) c= ( Ball (x1,r) )) by A6,A9,A10;
consider x2 being (Point of M) such that A12: (ex r2 being Real st ( union F ) c= ( ( union F1 ) \/ ( Ball (x2,r2) ) )) by A10;
consider r2 being Real such that A13: ( union F ) c= ( ( union F1 ) \/ ( Ball (x2,r2) ) ) by A12;
consider r1 being Real such that A14: ( union F1 ) c= ( Ball (x1,r1) ) by A11;
consider x being (Point of M) such that A15: (ex r being Real st ( ( Ball (x1,r1) ) \/ ( Ball (x2,r2) ) ) c= ( Ball (x,r) )) by CKB1:1;
take x;
consider r being Real such that A16: ( ( Ball (x1,r1) ) \/ ( Ball (x2,r2) ) ) c= ( Ball (x,r) ) by A15;
take r;
( ( union F1 ) \/ ( Ball (x2,r2) ) ) c= ( ( Ball (x1,r1) ) \/ ( Ball (x2,r2) ) ) by A14,XBOOLE_1:9;
then ( union F ) c= ( ( Ball (x1,r1) ) \/ ( Ball (x2,r2) ) ) by A13,XBOOLE_1:1;
hence thesis by A16,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
A17: P[ ( 0 ) ]
proof
let F being (Subset-Family of M);
assume that
F is  finite
and
F is  being_ball-family;
let n being Nat;
assume n = ( 0 );
then A18: ( Seg n ) = ( {} );
(for p being FinSequence holds ((( rng p ) = F & ( dom p ) = ( Seg n )) implies (ex x being (Point of M) st (ex r being Real st ( union F ) c= ( Ball (x,r) )))))
proof
set x = the (Point of M);
let p being FinSequence;
assume A19: (( rng p ) = F & ( dom p ) = ( Seg n ));
take x;
take ( 0 );
( union F ) = ( {} ) by A19,A18,RELAT_1:42,ZFMISC_1:2;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_1:2;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
(for n being Nat holds P[ n ]) from NAT_1:sch 2(A17,A5);
hence thesis;
end;
(ex n being Nat st ( dom p ) = ( Seg n )) by FINSEQ_1:def 2;
hence thesis by A2,A4,A3;
