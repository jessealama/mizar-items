theorem
Th14: (for T,S being non  empty TopSpace holds (for f being (Function of T,S) holds (for P being (Subset of T) holds ((P is  compact & f is  continuous) implies ( f .: P ) is  compact))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
let S being non  empty TopSpace;
let f being (Function of T,S);
let P being (Subset of T);
assume that
A1: P is  compact
and
A2: f is  continuous;
P c= ( [#] T );
then A3: P c= ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
(for F0 being (Subset-Family of S) holds ((F0 is (Cover of ( f .: P )) & F0 is  open) implies (ex G being (Subset-Family of S) st ((G c= F0 & G is (Cover of ( f .: P ))) & G is  finite))))
proof
let F0 being (Subset-Family of S);
assume that
A4: F0 is (Cover of ( f .: P ))
and
A5: F0 is  open;
set B0 = ( f " F0 );
A6: ( f .: P ) c= ( union F0 ) by A4,SETFAM_1:def 11;
P c= ( union B0 )
proof
let x being set;
thus (x in P implies x in ( union B0 ))
proof
A7: ( f " ( union F0 ) ) c= ( union ( f " F0 ) )
proof
let y being set;
assume A8: y in ( f " ( union F0 ) );
thus y in ( union ( f " F0 ) )
proof
( f . y ) in ( union F0 ) by A8,FUNCT_1:def 7;
then consider Q being set such that A9: (( f . y ) in Q & Q in F0) by TARSKI:def 4;
A10: y in ( dom f ) by A8,FUNCT_1:def 7;
(ex Z being set st (y in Z & Z in ( f " F0 )))
proof
set Z = ( f " Q );
take Z;
thus thesis by A10,A9,FUNCT_1:def 7,FUNCT_2:def 9;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 4;
end;

end;
assume A11: x in P;
then A12: ( f . x ) in ( f .: P ) by A3,FUNCT_1:def 6;
reconsider x as (Point of T) by A11;
A13: ( f . x ) in ( union F0 ) by A6,A12;
A14: ( f " { ( f . x ) } ) c= ( f " ( union F0 ) )
proof
let y being set;
assume A15: y in ( f " { ( f . x ) } );
then ( f . y ) in { ( f . x ) } by FUNCT_1:def 7;
then A16: ( f . y ) in ( union F0 ) by A13,TARSKI:def 1;
y in ( dom f ) by A15,FUNCT_1:def 7;
hence thesis by A16,FUNCT_1:def 7;
end;
( f . x ) in { ( f . x ) } by TARSKI:def 1;
then x in ( f " { ( f . x ) } ) by A3,A11,FUNCT_1:def 7;
then x in ( f " ( union F0 ) ) by A14;
hence thesis by A7;
end;

end;
then A17: B0 is (Cover of P) by SETFAM_1:def 11;
B0 is  open by A2,A5,CKB4:1;
then (ex B being (Subset-Family of T) st ((B c= B0 & B is (Cover of P)) & B is  finite)) by A1,A17,COMPTS_1:def 4;
then consider G being (Subset-Family of S) such that A18: ((G c= F0 & G is (Cover of ( f .: P ))) & G is  finite) by CKB7:1;
take G;
thus thesis by A18;
end;
hence thesis by COMPTS_1:def 4;
end;
