theorem
Th17: (for P being (Subset of ( R^1 )) holds (P is  compact implies ( [#] P ) is  bounded))
proof
let P being (Subset of ( R^1 ));
assume A1: P is  compact;
thus ( [#] P ) is  bounded
proof
now
per cases ;
case ( [#] P ) <> ( {} );
set r0 = 1;
defpred P[ (Subset of ( R^1 )) ]
 means
(ex x being (Point of ( RealSpace )) st (x in ( [#] P ) & $1 = ( Ball (x,r0) )));
consider R being (Subset-Family of ( R^1 )) such that A2: (for A being (Subset of ( R^1 )) holds (A in R iff P[ A ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
(for x being set holds (x in ( [#] P ) implies x in ( union R )))
proof
let x being set;
assume A3: x in ( [#] P );
then reconsider x as (Point of ( RealSpace )) by METRIC_1:def 13;
consider A being (Subset of ( RealSpace )) such that A4: A = ( Ball (x,r0) );
( R^1 ) = TopStruct (# (the carrier of ( RealSpace )),( Family_open_set ( RealSpace ) ) #) by PCOMPS_1:def 5,TOPMETR:def 6;
then reconsider A as (Subset of ( R^1 ));
(ex A being set st (x in A & A in R))
proof
take A;
( dist (x,x) ) = ( 0 ) by METRIC_1:1;
hence thesis by A2,A3,A4,METRIC_1:11;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 4;
end;
then ( [#] P ) c= ( union R ) by TARSKI:def 3;
then A5: R is (Cover of P) by SETFAM_1:def 11;
(for A being (Subset of ( R^1 )) holds (A in R implies A is  open))
proof
let A being (Subset of ( R^1 ));
assume A in R;
then (ex x being (Point of ( RealSpace )) st (x in ( [#] P ) & A = ( Ball (x,r0) ))) by A2;
hence thesis by TOPMETR:14,TOPMETR:def 6;
end;
then R is  open by TOPS_2:def 1;
then consider R0 being (Subset-Family of ( R^1 )) such that A6: R0 c= R and A7: R0 is (Cover of P) and A8: R0 is  finite by A1,A5,COMPTS_1:def 4;

A10: (for A being set holds (A in R0 implies (ex x being (Point of ( RealSpace )) st (ex r being Real st A = ( Ball (x,r) )))))
proof
let A being set;
assume A11: A in R0;
then reconsider A as (Subset of ( R^1 ));
consider x being (Point of ( RealSpace )) such that x in ( [#] P ) and A12: A = ( Ball (x,r0) ) by A2,A6,A11;
take x;
take r0;
thus thesis by A12;
end;

then reconsider R0 as (Subset-Family of ( RealSpace ));
R0 is  being_ball-family by A10,TOPMETR:def 4;
then consider x1 being (Point of ( RealSpace )) such that A13: (ex r1 being Real st ( union R0 ) c= ( Ball (x1,r1) )) by A8,CKB3:1;

A15: ( [#] P ) c= ( Ball (x1,r1) ) by A9,A14,XBOOLE_1:1;
reconsider x1 as Real by METRIC_1:def 13;
A16: (for p being Real holds (p in ( [#] P ) implies (( x1 - r1 ) <= p & p <= ( x1 + r1 ))))
proof
let p being Real;
reconsider a = x1,b = p as (Element of ( RealSpace )) by METRIC_1:def 13;
assume p in ( [#] P );
then ( dist (a,b) ) < r1 by A15,METRIC_1:11;
then A17: ( abs ( x1 - p ) ) < r1 by TOPMETR:11;
then ( - r1 ) <= ( x1 - p ) by ABSVALUE:5;
then ( ( - r1 ) + p ) <= x1 by XREAL_1:19;
then A18: p <= ( x1 - ( - r1 ) ) by XREAL_1:19;
( x1 - p ) <= r1 by A17,ABSVALUE:5;
then x1 <= ( p + r1 ) by XREAL_1:20;
hence thesis by A18,XREAL_1:20;
end;
( x1 - r1 ) is (LowerBound of ( [#] P ))
proof
let r being  ext-real number;
thus thesis by A16;
end;
then A19: ( [#] P ) is  bounded_below by XXREAL_2:def 9;
( x1 + r1 ) is (UpperBound of ( [#] P ))
proof
let r being  ext-real number;
thus thesis by A16;
end;
then ( [#] P ) is  bounded_above by XXREAL_2:def 10;
hence thesis by A19,XXREAL_2:def 11;
end;
case A20: ( [#] P ) = ( {} );
( 0 ) is (LowerBound of ( [#] P ))
proof
let r being  ext-real number;
thus thesis by A20;
end;
then A21: ( [#] P ) is  bounded_below by XXREAL_2:def 9;
( 0 ) is (UpperBound of ( [#] P ))
proof
let r being  ext-real number;
thus thesis by A20;
end;
then ( [#] P ) is  bounded_above by XXREAL_2:def 10;
hence thesis by A21,XXREAL_2:def 11;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
