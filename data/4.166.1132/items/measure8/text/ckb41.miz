proof
set C = ( C_Meas M );
now
let E being set;
assume A1: E in F;

(for A being (Subset of X) holds ( ( C . ( A /\ E9 ) ) + ( C . ( A /\ ( X \ E9 ) ) ) ) <= ( C . A ))
proof

(for n being Nat holds ( Bseq . n ) in F)
proof

A16: (for n being Nat holds ( ( vol (M,seq) ) . n ) = ( ( ( vol (M,Bseq) ) . n ) + ( ( vol (M,Cseq) ) . n ) ))
proof
let n being Nat;

( Bseq . n ) misses ( Cseq . n ) by A19,XBOOLE_1:76,XBOOLE_1:79;

(for r being  ext-real number holds (r in ( Svc (M,A) ) implies CA <= r))
proof
let r being  ext-real number;

then (ex G being (Covering of A,F) st r = ( SUM ( vol (M,G) ) )) by CKB19:def 1;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
then CA is (LowerBound of ( Svc (M,A) )) by XXREAL_2:def 2;
then CA <= ( inf ( Svc (M,A) ) ) by XXREAL_2:def 4;
hence CA <= ( ( C_Meas M ) . A ) by CKB21:def 1;
