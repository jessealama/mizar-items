theorem
Th17: (A in F implies (ex FSets being (Sep_Sequence of F) st (A = ( union ( rng FSets ) ) & (for n being Nat holds ( FSets . n ) c= ( CA . n )))))
proof
deffunc F((Element of ( NAT ))) = ( ( ( Partial_Diff_Union CA ) . $1 ) /\ A );
consider FSets being (Function of ( NAT ),( bool X )) such that A1: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( FSets . n ) = F(n)) from FUNCT_2:sch 4;
reconsider FSets as (SetSequence of X);
assume A2: A in F;

(for m,n being Nat holds (m <> n implies ( FSets . m ) misses ( FSets . n )))
proof
let m being Nat;
let n being Nat;
