theorem
Th24: (for S,T being non empty TopSpace holds (for N being (net of S) holds (for f being (Function of S,T) holds (f is  continuous implies ( f .: ( Lim N ) ) c= ( Lim ( f * N ) )))))
proof
let S being non empty TopSpace,T being non empty TopSpace;
let N being (net of S);
A1: ( [#] T ) <> ( {} );
let f being (Function of S,T);
assume that
A2: f is  continuous;
let p being set;
assume A3: p in ( f .: ( Lim N ) );
then reconsider p as (Point of T);
consider x being set such that A4: x in (the carrier of S) and A5: x in ( Lim N ) and A6: p = ( f . x ) by A3,FUNCT_2:64;
reconsider x as (Element of S) by A4;
now
let V being (a_neighborhood of p);
A7: p in ( Int V ) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
A9: x in ( f " ( Int V ) ) by A6,A7,FUNCT_2:38;
( f " ( Int V ) ) is  open by A1,A2,TOPS_2:43;
then ( f " ( Int V ) ) is (a_neighborhood of x) by A9,CONNSP_2:3;
then N is_eventually_in ( f " ( Int V ) ) by A5,YELLOW_6:def 15;
then consider i being (Element of N) such that A10: (for j being (Element of N) holds (j >= i implies ( N . j ) in ( f " ( Int V ) ))) by WAYBEL_0:def 11;
A11: (the mapping of ( f * N )) = ( f * (the mapping of N) ) by WAYBEL_9:def 8;
A12: ( the RelStr of ( f * N ) ) = ( the RelStr of N ) by WAYBEL_9:def 8;
then reconsider i9 = i as (Element of ( f * N ));
thus ( f * N ) is_eventually_in V
proof
take i9;
let j9 being (Element of ( f * N ));
reconsider j = j9 as (Element of N) by A12;
A13: ( f . ( N . j ) ) = ( ( f * N ) . j9 ) by A11,FUNCT_2:15;
assume j9 >= i9;
then ( N . j ) in ( f " ( Int V ) ) by A10,A12,YELLOW_0:1;
then A14: ( f . ( N . j ) ) in ( Int V ) by FUNCT_2:38;
( Int V ) c= V by TOPS_1:16;
hence thesis by A13,A14;
end;

end;
hence thesis by YELLOW_6:def 15;
