theorem
Th14: (for T being Semilattice holds (for S being  full non empty (SubRelStr of T) holds (S is  meet-inheriting iff (for X being  finite non empty (Subset of S) holds ( "/\" (X,T) ) in (the carrier of S)))))
proof
let T being Semilattice;
let S being  full non empty (SubRelStr of T);
hereby
assume A1: S is  meet-inheriting;
let X being  finite non empty (Subset of S);
A2: X is  finite;
defpred P[ set ]
 means
($1 <> ( {} ) implies ( "/\" ($1,T) ) in (the carrier of S));
A3: P[ ( {} ) ];
A4:now
let y being set,x being set;
assume that
A5: y in X
and
A6: x c= X
and
A7: P[ x ];
thus P[ ( x \/ { y } ) ]
proof
assume ( x \/ { y } ) <> ( {} );
reconsider y9 = y as (Element of S) by A5;
reconsider z = y9 as (Element of T) by YELLOW_0:58;
A8: x c= (the carrier of S) by A6,XBOOLE_1:1;
(the carrier of S) c= (the carrier of T) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
then reconsider x9 = x as  finite (Subset of T) by A6,A8,XBOOLE_1:1;
A9:  ex_inf_of { z },T by YELLOW_0:38;
A10: ( inf { z } ) = y9 by YELLOW_0:39;
now
assume A11: x9 <> ( {} );
then  ex_inf_of x9,T by YELLOW_0:55;
then A12: ( inf ( x9 \/ { z } ) ) = ( ( inf x9 ) "/\" z ) by A9,A10,YELLOW_2:4;
 ex_inf_of { ( inf x9 ),z },T by YELLOW_0:21;
then ( inf { ( inf x9 ),z } ) in (the carrier of S) by A1,A7,A11,YELLOW_0:def 16;
hence ( inf ( x9 \/ { z } ) ) in (the carrier of S) by A12,YELLOW_0:40;
end;
hence thesis by A10;
end;

end;
P[ X ] from FINSET_1:sch 2(A2,A3,A4);
hence ( "/\" (X,T) ) in (the carrier of S);
end;
assume A13: (for X being  finite non empty (Subset of S) holds ( "/\" (X,T) ) in (the carrier of S));
let x being (Element of T),y being (Element of T);
assume that
A14: x in (the carrier of S)
and
A15: y in (the carrier of S);
{ x,y } c= (the carrier of S) by A14,A15,ZFMISC_1:32;
hence thesis by A13;
