theorem
Th45: (for S,T being  Lawson  complete TopLattice holds (for f being  meet-preserving (Function of S,T) holds (f is  continuous iff (f is  directed-sups-preserving & (for X being non empty (Subset of S) holds f preserves_inf_of X)))))
proof
let S being  Lawson  complete TopLattice,T being  Lawson  complete TopLattice;
A1: ( [#] T ) <> ( {} );
set Ss = the  Scott (TopAugmentation of S);
set Ts = the  Scott (TopAugmentation of T);
set Sl = the  lower  correct (TopAugmentation of S);
set Tl = the  lower  correct (TopAugmentation of T);
A2: S is (TopAugmentation of S) by YELLOW_9:44;
A3: T is (TopAugmentation of T) by YELLOW_9:44;
A4: S is (Refinement of Ss,Sl) by A2,WAYBEL19:29;
A5: T is (Refinement of Ts,Tl) by A3,WAYBEL19:29;
A6: T is (TopAugmentation of Ts) by YELLOW_9:45;
A7: S is (TopAugmentation of Ss) by YELLOW_9:45;
A8: ( the RelStr of Ss ) = ( the RelStr of S ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
A9: ( the RelStr of Sl ) = ( the RelStr of S ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
A10: ( the RelStr of Ts ) = ( the RelStr of T ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
A11: ( the RelStr of Tl ) = ( the RelStr of T ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
let f being  meet-preserving (Function of S,T);
reconsider g = f as (Function of Sl,Tl) by A9,A11;
reconsider h = f as (Function of Ss,Ts) by A8,A10;
A12: ( [#] Ts ) <> ( {} );
hereby
assume A13: f is  continuous;
now
let P being (Subset of Ts);
reconsider A = P as (Subset of Ts);
reconsider C = A as (Subset of T) by A10;
assume A14: P is  open;
then C is  open by A6,WAYBEL19:37;
then A15: ( f " C ) is  open by A1,A13,TOPS_2:43;
A is  upper by A14,WAYBEL11:def 4;
then ( h " A ) is  upper by A8,A10,WAYBEL17:2,WAYBEL_9:1;
then ( f " C ) is  upper by A8,WAYBEL_0:25;
hence ( h " P ) is  open by A7,A15,WAYBEL19:41;
end;
then h is  continuous by A12,TOPS_2:43;
hence f is  directed-sups-preserving by A8,A10,CKB9:1;
(for X being non empty  filtered (Subset of S) holds f preserves_inf_of X)
proof
let F being non empty  filtered (Subset of S);
assume  ex_inf_of F,S;
thus  ex_inf_of ( f .: F ),T by YELLOW_0:17;
{ ( inf F ) } = ( Lim ( F opp+id ) ) by WAYBEL19:43;
then ( Im (f,( inf F )) ) c= ( Lim ( f * ( F opp+id ) ) ) by A13,CKB28:1;
then { ( f . ( inf F ) ) } c= ( Lim ( f * ( F opp+id ) ) ) by SETWISEO:8;
then A16: ( f . ( inf F ) ) in ( Lim ( f * ( F opp+id ) ) ) by ZFMISC_1:31;
reconsider G = ( f .: F ) as  filtered non empty (Subset of T) by WAYBEL20:24;
A17: ( rng (the mapping of ( f * ( F opp+id ) )) ) = ( rng ( f * (the mapping of ( F opp+id )) ) ) by WAYBEL_9:def 8
.= ( rng ( f * ( id F ) ) ) by WAYBEL19:27
.= ( rng ( f | F ) ) by RELAT_1:65
.= G by RELAT_1:115;
( Lim ( f * ( F opp+id ) ) ) = { ( inf ( f * ( F opp+id ) ) ) } by CKB54:1
.= { ( Inf (the mapping of ( f * ( F opp+id ) )) ) } by WAYBEL_9:def 2
.= { ( inf G ) } by A17,YELLOW_2:def 6;
hence thesis by A16,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
hence (for X being non empty (Subset of S) holds f preserves_inf_of X) by CKB7:1;
end;
assume f is  directed-sups-preserving;
then A18: h is  directed-sups-preserving by A8,A10,CKB9:1;
assume (for X being non empty (Subset of S) holds f preserves_inf_of X);
then (for X being non empty (Subset of Sl) holds g preserves_inf_of X) by A9,A11,WAYBEL_0:65;
then g is  continuous by WAYBEL19:8;
hence thesis by A4,A5,A18,WAYBEL19:24;
