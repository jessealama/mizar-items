theorem
Th44: (for T being  Lawson  complete TopLattice holds (for N being  eventually-filtered (net of T) holds ( Lim N ) = { ( inf N ) }))
proof
let T being  Lawson  complete TopLattice;
set S = the  Scott (TopAugmentation of T);
let N being  eventually-filtered (net of T);
reconsider F = ( rng (the mapping of N) ) as  filtered non  empty (Subset of T) by CKB53:1;
A1: (the topology of S) = ( sigma T ) by YELLOW_9:51;
A2: ( the RelStr of S ) = ( the RelStr of T ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
A3: ( inf N ) = ( Inf (the mapping of N) ) by WAYBEL_9:def 2
.= ( "/\" (F,T) ) by YELLOW_2:def 6;
A4: ( dom (the mapping of N) ) = (the carrier of N) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
thus ( Lim N ) c= { ( inf N ) }
proof
let p being set;
assume A5: p in ( Lim N );
then reconsider p as (Element of T);
p is_<=_than F
proof
let u being (Element of T);
assume u in F;
then consider i being set such that A6: i in ( dom (the mapping of N) ) and A7: u = ( (the mapping of N) . i ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider i as (Element of N) by A6;
consider ii being (Element of N) such that A8: (for k being (Element of N) holds (ii <= k implies ( N . i ) >= ( N . k ))) by WAYBEL_0:12;
( downarrow u ) is  closed by WAYBEL19:38;
then A9: ( Cl ( downarrow u ) ) = ( downarrow u ) by PRE_TOPC:22;
N is_eventually_in ( downarrow u )
proof
take ii;
let j being (Element of N);
assume j >= ii;
then ( N . j ) <= ( N . i ) by A8;
hence thesis by A7,WAYBEL_0:17;
end;
then ( Lim N ) c= ( downarrow u ) by A9,WAYBEL19:26;
hence thesis by A5,WAYBEL_0:17;
end;
then A10: p <= ( inf N ) by A3,YELLOW_0:33;
( inf N ) is_<=_than F by A3,YELLOW_0:33;
then A11: F c= ( uparrow ( inf N ) ) by YELLOW_2:2;
( uparrow ( inf N ) ) is  closed by WAYBEL19:38;
then ( Cl ( uparrow ( inf N ) ) ) = ( uparrow ( inf N ) ) by PRE_TOPC:22;
then A12: ( Cl F ) c= ( uparrow ( inf N ) ) by A11,PRE_TOPC:19;
p in ( Cl F ) by A5,WAYBEL_9:24;
then p >= ( inf N ) by A12,WAYBEL_0:18;
then p = ( inf N ) by A10,ORDERS_2:2;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 1;

reconsider K = ( ( sigma T ) \/ { ( ( uparrow x ) ` ) where x is (Element of T): (not contradiction) } ) as (prebasis of T) by WAYBEL19:30;

assume that
A13: ( inf F ) in A
and
A14: A in K;
per cases  by A14,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A15: A in ( sigma T );

then reconsider a = A as (Subset of S) by A1;
a is  open by A1,A15,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then a is  upper by WAYBEL11:def 4;
then A16: A is  upper by A2,WAYBEL_0:25;
set i = the (Element of N);
thus N is_eventually_in A
proof
take i;
let j being (Element of N);
( N . j ) in F by A4,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then ( N . j ) >= ( inf F ) by YELLOW_2:22;
hence thesis by A13,A16,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
end;

end;
suppose A in { ( ( uparrow x ) ` ) where x is (Element of T): (not contradiction) };

then consider x being (Element of T) such that A17: A = ( ( uparrow x ) ` );
(not ( inf F ) >= x) by A13,A17,YELLOW_9:1;
then (not F is_>=_than x) by YELLOW_0:33;
then consider y being (Element of T) such that A18: y in F and A19: (not y >= x) by LATTICE3:def 8;
consider i being set such that A20: i in (the carrier of N) and A21: y = ( (the mapping of N) . i ) by A4,A18,FUNCT_1:def 3;
thus N is_eventually_in A
proof
reconsider i as (Element of N) by A20;
consider ii being (Element of N) such that A22: (for k being (Element of N) holds (ii <= k implies ( N . i ) >= ( N . k ))) by WAYBEL_0:12;
take ii;
let j being (Element of N);
assume j >= ii;
then ( N . j ) <= ( N . i ) by A22;
then (not ( N . j ) >= x) by A19,A21,ORDERS_2:3;
hence thesis by A17,YELLOW_9:1;
end;

end;
end;
then ( inf F ) in ( Lim N ) by WAYBEL19:25;
hence thesis by A3,ZFMISC_1:31;
