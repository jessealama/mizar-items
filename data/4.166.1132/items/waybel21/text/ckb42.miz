theorem
Th33: (for S,T being  up-complete non  empty Poset holds (for f being  monotone (Function of S,T) holds (for D being non  empty  directed (Subset of S) holds ( lim_inf ( f * ( Net-Str D ) ) ) = ( sup ( f .: D ) ))))
proof
let S being  up-complete non  empty Poset;
let T being  up-complete non  empty Poset;
let f being  monotone (Function of S,T);
let X being non  empty  directed (Subset of S);
set M = ( Net-Str X );
set N = ( f * M );
deffunc up((Element of N)) = { ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= $1 };
deffunc infy((Element of N)) = ( "/\" (up($1),T) );
set NT = { infy(j) where j is (Element of N): (not contradiction) };
A1: ( the RelStr of N ) = ( the RelStr of M ) by WAYBEL_9:def 8;
A2: (the mapping of N) = ( f * (the mapping of M) ) by WAYBEL_9:def 8;
A3: (the carrier of M) = X by CKB41:1;
A4: (the mapping of M) = ( id X ) by CKB41:1;
A5:now
let i being (Element of N);
thus ( N . i ) = ( f . ( ( id X ) . i ) ) by A1,A2,A4,FUNCT_2:15
.= ( f . i ) by A1,A3,FUNCT_1:18;
end;
A6: (for i being (Element of N) holds infy(i) = ( f . i ))
proof
let i being (Element of N);
i in X by A1,A3;
then reconsider x = i as (Element of S);
A7: i <= i;
( N . i ) = ( f . x ) by A5;
then ( f . x ) in up(i) by A7;
then A8: (for z being (Element of T) holds (z is_<=_than up(i) implies z <= ( f . x ))) by LATTICE3:def 8;
( f . x ) is_<=_than up(i)
proof
let z being (Element of T);
assume z in up(i);
then consider j being (Element of N) such that A9: z = ( N . j ) and A10: j >= i;
reconsider j as (Element of N);
j in X by A1,A3;
then reconsider y = j as (Element of S);
A11: M is  full  full (SubRelStr of S) by CKB41:1;
( the RelStr of S ) = ( the RelStr of S );
then N is  full  full (SubRelStr of S) by A1,A11,CKB15:1;
then y >= x by A10,YELLOW_0:59;
then ( f . y ) >= ( f . x ) by WAYBEL_1:def 2;
hence thesis by A5,A9;
end;
hence thesis by A8,YELLOW_0:31;
end;
NT = ( f .: X )
proof
thus NT c= ( f .: X )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in NT;
then consider j being (Element of N) such that A12: x = infy(j);
reconsider j as (Element of N);
A13: x = ( f . j ) by A6,A12;
j in X by A1,A3;
hence thesis by A13,FUNCT_2:35;
end;

let y being set;
assume y in ( f .: X );
then consider x being set such that A14: x in (the carrier of S) and A15: x in X and A16: y = ( f . x ) by FUNCT_2:64;
reconsider x as (Element of S) by A14;
reconsider i = x as (Element of N) by A1,A15,CKB41:1;
( f . x ) = infy(i) by A6;
hence thesis by A16;
end;
hence thesis by WAYBEL11:def 6;
