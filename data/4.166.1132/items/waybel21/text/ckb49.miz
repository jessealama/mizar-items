theorem
(for T being non  empty RelStr holds (for N being (net of T) holds (for M being non  empty  full (SubNetStr of N) holds ((for i being (Element of N) holds (ex j being (Element of N) st (j >= i & j in (the carrier of M)))) implies (M is (subnet of N) & ( incl (M,N) ) is (Embedding of M,N))))))
proof
let T being non  empty RelStr;
let N being (net of T);
let M being non  empty  full (SubNetStr of N);
assume that
A1: (for i being (Element of N) holds (ex j being (Element of N) st (j >= i & j in (the carrier of M))));
A2: (the mapping of M) = ( (the mapping of N) | (the carrier of M) ) by YELLOW_6:def 6;
A3: M is  full  full (SubRelStr of N) by YELLOW_6:def 7;
then A4: (the carrier of M) c= (the carrier of N) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
M is  directed
proof
let x being (Element of M);
let y being (Element of M);
reconsider i = x,j = y as (Element of N) by A3,YELLOW_0:58;
consider k being (Element of N) such that A5: k >= i and A6: k >= j by YELLOW_6:def 3;
consider l being (Element of N) such that A7: l >= k and A8: l in (the carrier of M) by A1;
reconsider z = l as (Element of M) by A8;
take z;
A9: l >= i by A5,A7,YELLOW_0:def 2;
l >= j by A6,A7,YELLOW_0:def 2;
hence thesis by A9,YELLOW_6:12;
end;
then reconsider K = M as (net of T) by A3;
A10:now
set f = ( incl (K,N) );
A11: f = ( id (the carrier of K) ) by A4,YELLOW_9:def 1;
hence (the mapping of K) = ( (the mapping of N) * f ) by A2,RELAT_1:65;
let m being (Element of N);
consider j being (Element of N) such that A12: j >= m and A13: j in (the carrier of K) by A1;
reconsider n = j as (Element of K) by A13;
take n;
let p being (Element of K);
reconsider q = p as (Element of N) by A3,YELLOW_0:58;
assume n <= p;
then A14: j <= q by YELLOW_6:11;
( f . p ) = q by A11,FUNCT_1:18;
hence m <= ( f . p ) by A12,A14,YELLOW_0:def 2;
end;
hence M is (subnet of N) by YELLOW_6:def 9;
hence thesis by A10,CKB45:def 1;
end;
