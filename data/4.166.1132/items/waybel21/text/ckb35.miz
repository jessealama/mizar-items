theorem
(for S being non  empty Poset holds (for N being  monotone  reflexive (net of S) holds { ( "/\" ({ ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= j },S) ) where j is (Element of N): (not contradiction) } is  directed non  empty  directed non  empty (Subset of S)))
proof
let S being non  empty Poset;
let N being  monotone  reflexive (net of S);
set X = { ( "/\" ({ ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= j },S) ) where j is (Element of N): (not contradiction) };
set jj = the (Element of N);
A1: ( "/\" ({ ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= jj },S) ) in X;
X c= (the carrier of S)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in X;
then (ex j being (Element of N) st x = ( "/\" ({ ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= j },S) ));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider X as non  empty (Subset of S) by A1;
X is  directed
proof
let x being (Element of S);
let y being (Element of S);
assume x in X;
then consider j1 being (Element of N) such that A2: x = ( "/\" ({ ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= j1 },S) );
assume y in X;
then consider j2 being (Element of N) such that A3: y = ( "/\" ({ ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= j2 },S) );
reconsider j1,j2 as (Element of N);
( [#] N ) is  directed by WAYBEL_0:def 6;
then consider j being (Element of N) such that j in ( [#] N ) and A4: j >= j1 and A5: j >= j2 by WAYBEL_0:def 1;
set z = ( "/\" ({ ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= j },S) );
take z;
thus z in X;
deffunc up((Element of N)) = { ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= $1 };
A6: (for j being (Element of N) holds  ex_inf_of up(j),S)
proof
let j being (Element of N);
reconsider j9 = j as (Element of N);
now
take x = ( N . j );
j9 <= j9;
then A7: x in up(j);
thus x is_<=_than up(j)
proof
let y being (Element of S);
assume y in up(j);
then (ex i being (Element of N) st (y = ( N . i ) & i >= j));
hence x <= y by WAYBEL11:def 9;
end;

let y being (Element of S);
assume y is_<=_than up(j);
hence y <= x by A7,LATTICE3:def 8;
end;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:16;
end;
then A8:  ex_inf_of up(j1),S;
A9:  ex_inf_of up(j2),S by A6;
A10:  ex_inf_of up(j),S by A6;
set A = { ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= j };
A c= { ( N . k ) where k is (Element of N): k >= j1 }
proof
let a being set;
assume a in A;
then consider k being (Element of N) such that A11: a = ( N . k ) and A12: k >= j;
reconsider k as (Element of N);
k >= j1 by A4,A12,ORDERS_2:3;
hence thesis by A11;
end;
hence z >= x by A2,A8,A10,YELLOW_0:35;
A c= { ( N . k ) where k is (Element of N): k >= j2 }
proof
let a being set;
assume a in A;
then consider k being (Element of N) such that A13: a = ( N . k ) and A14: k >= j;
reconsider k as (Element of N);
k >= j2 by A5,A14,ORDERS_2:3;
hence thesis by A13;
end;
hence thesis by A3,A9,A10,YELLOW_0:35;
end;
hence thesis;
