theorem
Th30: (for S,T being non empty TopPoset holds (for X being non empty  filtered (Subset of S) holds (for f being  monotone (Function of S,T) holds (for Y being non empty  filtered (Subset of T) holds (Y = ( f .: X ) implies ( f * ( X opp+id ) ) is (subnet of ( Y opp+id )))))))
proof
let S being non empty TopPoset,T being non empty TopPoset;
let X being non empty  filtered (Subset of S);
let f being  monotone (Function of S,T);
let Y being non empty  filtered (Subset of T);
assume that
A1: Y = ( f .: X );
set N = ( f * ( X opp+id ) );
set M = ( Y opp+id );
A2: ( the RelStr of N ) = ( the RelStr of ( X opp+id ) ) by WAYBEL_9:def 8;
A3: (the mapping of N) = ( f * (the mapping of ( X opp+id )) ) by WAYBEL_9:def 8;
A4: (the carrier of M) = Y by YELLOW_9:7;
A5: (the mapping of M) = ( id Y ) by WAYBEL19:27;
A6: (the carrier of ( X opp+id )) = X by YELLOW_9:7;
(the mapping of ( X opp+id )) = ( id X ) by WAYBEL19:27;
then A7: (the mapping of N) = ( f | X ) by A3,RELAT_1:65;
then A8: ( rng (the mapping of N) ) = ( f .: X ) by RELAT_1:115;
( dom (the mapping of N) ) = X by A2,A6,FUNCT_2:def 1;
then reconsider g = ( f | X ) as (Function of N,M) by A1,A2,A4,A6,A7,A8,FUNCT_2:def 1,RELSET_1:4;
take g;
thus (the mapping of N) = ( (the mapping of M) * g ) by A1,A5,A7,A8,RELAT_1:53;
let m being (Element of M);
consider n being set such that A9: n in (the carrier of S) and A10: n in X and A11: m = ( f . n ) by A1,A4,FUNCT_2:64;
reconsider n as (Element of N) by A2,A10,YELLOW_9:7;
take n;
let p being (Element of N);
p in X by A2,A6;
then reconsider n9 = n,p9 = p as (Element of S) by A9;
reconsider fp = ( f . p9 ) as (Element of M) by A1,A2,A4,A6,FUNCT_2:35;
( X opp+id ) is (SubRelStr of ( S opp )) by YELLOW_9:7;
then A12: N is (SubRelStr of ( S opp )) by A2,CKB15:1;
A13: M is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( T opp )) by YELLOW_9:7;
assume n <= p;
then ( n9 ~ ) <= ( p9 ~ ) by A12,YELLOW_0:59;
then n9 >= p9 by LATTICE3:9;
then ( f . n9 ) >= ( f . p9 ) by WAYBEL_1:def 2;
then ( ( f . n9 ) ~ ) <= ( ( f . p9 ) ~ ) by LATTICE3:9;
then fp >= m by A11,A13,YELLOW_0:60;
hence m <= ( g . p ) by A2,A6,FUNCT_1:49;
end;
