begin
reserve F for Field;
reserve x for (Element of [: (the carrier of F),(the carrier of F),(the carrier of F) :]);
definition
let F;
func c3compl F -> (UnOp of [: (the carrier of F),(the carrier of F),(the carrier of F) :])
means
:Def3: ( it . x ) = [ ( - ( x `1 ) ),( - ( x `2 ) ),( - ( x `3 ) ) ];
existence
proof
deffunc O((Element of [: (the carrier of F),(the carrier of F),(the carrier of F) :])) = [ ( - ( $1 `1 ) ),( - ( $1 `2 ) ),( - ( $1 `3 ) ) ];
consider f being (UnOp of [: (the carrier of F),(the carrier of F),(the carrier of F) :]) such that A1: ( f . x ) = O(x) from FUNCT_2:sch 4;
take f;
thus thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let f being (UnOp of [: (the carrier of F),(the carrier of F),(the carrier of F) :]),g being (UnOp of [: (the carrier of F),(the carrier of F),(the carrier of F) :]);
assume that
A2: ( f . x ) = [ ( - ( x `1 ) ),( - ( x `2 ) ),( - ( x `3 ) ) ]
and
A3: ( g . x ) = [ ( - ( x `1 ) ),( - ( x `2 ) ),( - ( x `3 ) ) ];
( f . x ) = ( g . x )
proof
thus ( f . x ) = [ ( - ( x `1 ) ),( - ( x `2 ) ),( - ( x `3 ) ) ] by A2
.= ( g . x ) by A3;
end;
hence f = g by FUNCT_2:63;
end;
