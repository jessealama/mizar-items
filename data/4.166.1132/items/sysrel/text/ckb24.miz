theorem
Th40: (((R c= ( R * R ) & ( R * ( R \ ( id ( rng R ) ) ) ) = ( {} )) implies ( id ( rng R ) ) c= R) & ((R c= ( R * R ) & ( ( R \ ( id ( dom R ) ) ) * R ) = ( {} )) implies ( id ( dom R ) ) c= R))
proof
thus ((R c= ( R * R ) & ( R * ( R \ ( id ( rng R ) ) ) ) = ( {} )) implies ( id ( rng R ) ) c= R)
proof
assume that
A1: R c= ( R * R )
and
A2: ( R * ( R \ ( id ( rng R ) ) ) ) = ( {} );
(for y holds (y in ( rng R ) implies [ y,y ] in R))
proof
let y;
assume y in ( rng R );
then consider x such that A3: [ x,y ] in R by RELAT_1:def 5;
consider z such that A4: [ x,z ] in R and A5: [ z,y ] in R by A1,A3,RELAT_1:def 8;
z = y
proof
assume z <> y;
then (not [ z,y ] in ( id ( rng R ) )) by RELAT_1:def 10;
then [ z,y ] in ( R \ ( id ( rng R ) ) ) by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence contradiction by A2,A4,RELAT_1:def 8;
end;
hence thesis by A5;
end;
hence thesis by RELAT_1:47;

assume that
A6: R c= ( R * R )
and
A7: ( ( R \ ( id ( dom R ) ) ) * R ) = ( {} );
(for x holds (x in ( dom R ) implies [ x,x ] in R))
proof
let x;
assume x in ( dom R );
then consider y such that A8: [ x,y ] in R by RELAT_1:def 4;
consider z such that A9: [ x,z ] in R and A10: [ z,y ] in R by A6,A8,RELAT_1:def 8;
z = x
proof
assume z <> x;
then (not [ x,z ] in ( id ( dom R ) )) by RELAT_1:def 10;
then [ x,z ] in ( R \ ( id ( dom R ) ) ) by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence contradiction by A7,A10,RELAT_1:def 8;
end;
hence thesis by A9;
end;
hence thesis by RELAT_1:47;
