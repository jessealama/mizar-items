theorem
Th2: ((((for a holds (for b holds (a in b implies ( L . a ) c= ( L . b )))) & (for a holds (( L . a ) in ( Union L ) & ( L . a ) is  epsilon-transitive))) & ( Union L ) is  predicatively_closed) implies ( Union L ) |= ( the_axiom_of_power_sets ))
proof
assume that
A1: (for a holds (for b holds (a in b implies ( L . a ) c= ( L . b ))))
and
A2: (for a holds (( L . a ) in ( Union L ) & ( L . a ) is  epsilon-transitive))
and
A3: ( Union L ) is  predicatively_closed;
set M = ( Union L );
A4: (X in ( L . a ) implies ( ( L . a ) /\ ( bool X ) ) in M)
proof
set f = the (Function of ( VAR ),( L . a ));
assume X in ( L . a );
then reconsider e = X as (Element of ( L . a ));
( L . a ) in M by A2;
then A5: ( Section (( All (( x. 2 ),( ( ( x. 2 ) 'in' ( x. ( 0 ) ) ) => ( ( x. 2 ) 'in' ( x. 1 ) ) )) ),( f / (( x. 1 ),e) )) ) in M by A3,CKB2:def 1;
( L . a ) is  epsilon-transitive by A2;
hence thesis by A5,CKB3:1;

A10: (for d being (Element of D) holds (ex a st P[ d,a ]))
proof
let d being (Element of D);
d in M by XBOOLE_0:def 4;

A14: ( rng f ) c= W
proof
let u;

proof

( Union L ) is  epsilon-transitive
proof

reconsider u as Ordinal by A22;
u in ( On W ) by A22,ZF_REFLE:def 2;
then reconsider u as (Ordinal of W) by ZF_REFLE:7;
( L . u ) is  epsilon-transitive by A2;
then A24: X c= ( L . u ) by A23,ORDINAL1:def 2;
let u1;
A25: ( L . u ) c= ( Union L ) by ZF_REFLE:16;
assume u1 in X;
