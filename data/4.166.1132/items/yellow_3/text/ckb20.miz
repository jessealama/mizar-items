proof
[" P,R "] c= [: [: A,X :],[: B,Y :] :]
proof
let q being set;
assume A1: q in [" P,R "];
then consider a being set,b being set such that A2: q = [ a,b ] by CKB19:1;
[ ( ( q `1 ) `2 ),( ( q `2 ) `2 ) ] in R by A1,CKB19:1;
then consider s being set,t being set such that A3: [ ( ( q `1 ) `2 ),( ( q `2 ) `2 ) ] = [ s,t ] and A4: s in X and A5: t in Y by RELSET_1:2;
consider a2 being set,b2 being set such that A6: ( q `2 ) = [ a2,b2 ] by A1,CKB19:1;
[ ( ( q `1 ) `1 ),( ( q `2 ) `1 ) ] in P by A1,CKB19:1;
then consider x being set,y being set such that A7: [ ( ( q `1 ) `1 ),( ( q `2 ) `1 ) ] = [ x,y ] and A8: x in A and A9: y in B by RELSET_1:2;
consider a1 being set,b1 being set such that A10: ( q `1 ) = [ a1,b1 ] by A1,CKB19:1;
A11: b = [ a2,b2 ] by A2,A6,MCART_1:7;
then A12: ( b `2 ) = t by A3,A6,ZFMISC_1:27;
A13: a = [ a1,b1 ] by A2,A10,MCART_1:7;
then A14: ( a `2 ) = s by A3,A10,ZFMISC_1:27;
( b `1 ) = y by A7,A6,A11,ZFMISC_1:27;
then A15: b in [: B,Y :] by A9,A5,A11,A12,MCART_1:11;
( a `1 ) = x by A7,A10,A13,ZFMISC_1:27;
then a in [: A,X :] by A8,A4,A13,A14,MCART_1:11;
