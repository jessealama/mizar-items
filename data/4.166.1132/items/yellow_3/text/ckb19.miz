theorem
Th10: (for P,R being Relation holds (for x being set holds (x in [" P,R "] iff (((([ ( ( x `1 ) `1 ),( ( x `2 ) `1 ) ] in P & [ ( ( x `1 ) `2 ),( ( x `2 ) `2 ) ] in R) & (ex a,b being set st x = [ a,b ])) & (ex c,d being set st ( x `1 ) = [ c,d ])) & (ex e,f being set st ( x `2 ) = [ e,f ])))))
proof
let P being Relation;
let R being Relation;
let x being set;
hereby
assume A1: x in [" P,R "];
then consider y,z being set such that A2: x = [ y,z ] by RELAT_1:def 1;
consider p,q,s,t being set such that A3: y = [ p,q ] and A4: z = [ s,t ] and A5: ([ p,s ] in P & [ q,t ] in R) by A1,A2,CKB18:def 1;
(( ( x `1 ) `1 ) = p & ( ( x `1 ) `2 ) = q) by A2,A3,A4,CKB5:1;
hence ([ ( ( x `1 ) `1 ),( ( x `2 ) `1 ) ] in P & [ ( ( x `1 ) `2 ),( ( x `2 ) `2 ) ] in R) by A2,A3,A4,A5,CKB5:1;
thus (ex a,b being set st x = [ a,b ]) by A2;
thus (ex c,d being set st ( x `1 ) = [ c,d ]) by A2,A3,MCART_1:7;
thus (ex e,f being set st ( x `2 ) = [ e,f ]) by A2,A4,MCART_1:7;
end;
assume that
A6: [ ( ( x `1 ) `1 ),( ( x `2 ) `1 ) ] in P
and
A7: [ ( ( x `1 ) `2 ),( ( x `2 ) `2 ) ] in R
and
A8: (ex a,b being set st x = [ a,b ])
and
A9: (ex c,d being set st ( x `1 ) = [ c,d ])
and
A10: (ex e,f being set st ( x `2 ) = [ e,f ]);
consider c,d being set such that A11: ( x `1 ) = [ c,d ] by A9;
consider e,f being set such that A12: ( x `2 ) = [ e,f ] by A10;
[ c,( ( x `2 ) `1 ) ] in P by A6,A11,MCART_1:7;
then A13: [ c,e ] in P by A12,MCART_1:7;
consider a,b being set such that A14: x = [ a,b ] by A8;
[ d,( ( x `2 ) `2 ) ] in R by A7,A11,MCART_1:7;
then A15: [ d,f ] in R by A12,MCART_1:7;
A16: b = [ e,f ] by A14,A12,MCART_1:7;
a = [ c,d ] by A14,A11,MCART_1:7;
hence thesis by A14,A16,A13,A15,CKB18:def 1;
