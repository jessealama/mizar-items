let L being RelStr;
cluster ( Sub L ) ->  reflexive  antisymmetric  transitive;
coherence
proof
set R = ( Sub L );
thus R is  reflexive
proof
let x being (Element of R);
reconsider A = x as  strict (SubRelStr of L) by CKB29:def 1;
A is (SubRelStr of A) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
hence thesis by CKB30:1;
end;

thus R is  antisymmetric
proof
let x being (Element of R),y being (Element of R);
reconsider A = x,B = y as  strict (SubRelStr of L) by CKB29:def 1;
assume that
A1: x <= y
and
A2: y <= x;

then A4: (the carrier of B) c= (the carrier of A) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
A5: A is (SubRelStr of B) by A1,CKB30:1;
then (the carrier of A) c= (the carrier of B) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
then A6: (the carrier of A) = (the carrier of B) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
A7: (the InternalRel of B) c= (the InternalRel of A) by A3,YELLOW_0:def 13;
(the InternalRel of A) c= (the InternalRel of B) by A5,YELLOW_0:def 13;
hence thesis by A7,A6,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;

thus R is  transitive
proof
let x being (Element of R),y being (Element of R),z being (Element of R);
reconsider A = x,B = y,C = z as  strict (SubRelStr of L) by CKB29:def 1;
assume that
A8: x <= y
