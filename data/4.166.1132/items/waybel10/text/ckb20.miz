theorem
Th9: (for S,T being non empty RelStr holds (for R being non empty (SubRelStr of S) holds (for f being (Function of S,T) holds (for g being (Function of T,S) holds ((f is  one-to-one & g = ( f " )) implies (( g | ( Image ( f | R ) ) ) is (Function of ( Image ( f | R ) ),R) & ( g | ( Image ( f | R ) ) ) = ( ( f | R ) " )))))))
proof
let S being non empty RelStr,T being non empty RelStr;
let R being non empty (SubRelStr of S);
let f being (Function of S,T);
let g being (Function of T,S);
assume that
A1: f is  one-to-one
and
A2: g = ( f " );
set h = ( g | ( Image ( f | R ) ) );
A3: ( dom f ) = (the carrier of S) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A4: ( dom h ) = (the carrier of ( Image ( f | R ) )) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A5: (the carrier of R) c= (the carrier of S) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
( rng h ) c= (the carrier of R)
proof
let y being set;
assume y in ( rng h );
then consider x being set such that A6: x in ( dom h ) and A7: y = ( h . x ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider x as (Element of ( Image ( f | R ) )) by A6;
consider a being (Element of R) such that A8: ( ( f | R ) . a ) = x by YELLOW_2:10;
A9: ( f . a ) = x by A8,CKB17:1;
A10: a in (the carrier of R);
y = ( g . x ) by A7,CKB17:1;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A5,A3,A10,A9,FUNCT_1:32;
end;
hence h is (Function of ( Image ( f | R ) ),R) by A4,RELSET_1:4;
A11: ( rng ( f | R ) ) = (the carrier of ( Image ( f | R ) )) by YELLOW_0:def 15;
A12: ( f | R ) is  one-to-one by A1,CKB18:1;
A13:now
let x being set;
A14: ( dom ( f | R ) ) = (the carrier of R) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
assume A15: x in (the carrier of ( Image ( f | R ) ));
then consider y being set such that A16: y in ( dom ( f | R ) ) and A17: x = ( ( f | R ) . y ) by A11,FUNCT_1:def 3;
A18: y = ( ( ( f | R ) " ) . x ) by A12,A16,A17,FUNCT_1:32;
x = ( f . y ) by A16,A17,CKB17:1;
then y = ( g . x ) by A1,A2,A5,A3,A16,A14,FUNCT_1:32;
hence ( h . x ) = ( ( ( f | R ) " ) . x ) by A15,A18,CKB17:1;
end;
( dom ( ( f | R ) " ) ) = ( rng ( f | R ) ) by A12,FUNCT_1:33;
hence thesis by A4,A11,A13,FUNCT_1:2;
end;
