theorem
Th12: (for X being set holds (for L being non empty RelStr holds (for f,g being (Function of X,(the carrier of L)) holds (for x,y being (Element of ( L |^ X )) holds ((x = f & y = g) implies (x <= y iff f <= g))))))
proof
let X being set;
let L being non empty RelStr;
let f being (Function of X,(the carrier of L)),g being (Function of X,(the carrier of L));
let x being (Element of ( L |^ X )),y being (Element of ( L |^ X ));
assume that
A1: x = f
and
A2: y = g;
set J = ( X --> L );
A3: ( L |^ X ) = ( product J ) by YELLOW_1:def 5;
A4: (the carrier of ( product J )) = ( product ( Carrier J ) ) by YELLOW_1:def 4;
then A5: (x <= y iff (ex f,g being Function st ((f = x & g = y) & (for i being set holds (i in X implies (ex R being RelStr st (ex xi,yi being (Element of R) st (((R = ( J . i ) & xi = ( f . i )) & yi = ( g . i )) & xi <= yi)))))))) by A3,YELLOW_1:def 4;
hereby
assume A6: x <= y;
thus f <= g
proof
let i being set;
assume A7: i in X;
then A8: ( J . i ) = L by FUNCOP_1:7;
(ex R being RelStr st (ex xi,yi being (Element of R) st (((R = ( J . i ) & xi = ( f . i )) & yi = ( g . i )) & xi <= yi))) by A1,A2,A5,A6,A7;
hence thesis by A8;
end;

end;
assume A9: (for j being set holds (j in X implies (ex a,b being (Element of L) st ((a = ( f . j ) & b = ( g . j )) & a <= b))));
now
reconsider f9 = f,g9 = g as Function;
take f9;
take g9;
thus (f9 = x & g9 = y) by A1,A2;
let i being set;
assume A10: i in X;
then A11: ( J . i ) = L by FUNCOP_1:7;
(ex a,b being (Element of L) st ((a = ( f . i ) & b = ( g . i )) & a <= b)) by A9,A10;
hence (ex R being RelStr st (ex xi,yi being (Element of R) st (((R = ( J . i ) & xi = ( f9 . i )) & yi = ( g9 . i )) & xi <= yi))) by A11;
end;
hence thesis by A4,A3,YELLOW_1:def 4;
end;
