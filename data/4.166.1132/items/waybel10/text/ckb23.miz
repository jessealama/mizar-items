definition
let L being non empty  reflexive RelStr;
func ClOpers L -> non empty  full  strict (SubRelStr of ( MonMaps (L,L) ))
means
:Def2: (for f being (Function of L,L) holds (f is (Element of it) iff f is  closure));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
$1 is  closure  closure (Function of L,L);
set h = the  closure (Function of L,L);
h in ( Funcs ((the carrier of L),(the carrier of L)) ) by FUNCT_2:9;
then A1: h in (the carrier of ( MonMaps (L,L) )) by YELLOW_1:def 6;
A2: P[ h ];
consider S being non empty  full  strict (SubRelStr of ( MonMaps (L,L) )) such that A3: (for f being (Element of ( MonMaps (L,L) )) holds (f is (Element of S) iff P[ f ])) from CKB1:sch 1(A2,A1);
take S;
let f being (Function of L,L);
hereby
assume A4: f is (Element of S);
then f is (Element of ( MonMaps (L,L) )) by YELLOW_0:58;
hence f is  closure by A3,A4;
end;
assume A5: f is  closure;
f in ( Funcs ((the carrier of L),(the carrier of L)) ) by FUNCT_2:9;
then f in (the carrier of ( MonMaps (L,L) )) by A5,YELLOW_1:def 6;
hence thesis by A3,A5;

correctness
proof
let S1 being non empty  full  strict (SubRelStr of ( MonMaps (L,L) )),S2 being non empty  full  strict (SubRelStr of ( MonMaps (L,L) ));
assume that
A6: (for f being (Function of L,L) holds (f is (Element of S1) iff f is  closure))
and
A7: (for f being (Function of L,L) holds (f is (Element of S2) iff f is  closure));
(the carrier of S1) = (the carrier of S2)
proof
hereby
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of S1);
then reconsider y = x as (Element of S1);
y is (Element of ( MonMaps (L,L) )) by YELLOW_0:58;
then reconsider y as (Function of L,L) by CKB22:1;
y is  closure by A6;
then y is (Element of S2) by A7;
hence x in (the carrier of S2);
end;
let x being set;
