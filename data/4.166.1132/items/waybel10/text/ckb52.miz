theorem
Th24: (for L being RelStr holds (for S being  full (SubRelStr of L) holds (for X being (Subset of S) holds ((X is  directed  directed (Subset of L) implies X is  directed) & (X is  filtered  filtered (Subset of L) implies X is  filtered)))))
proof
let L being RelStr;
let S being  full (SubRelStr of L);
let X being (Subset of S);
hereby
assume A1: X is  directed  directed (Subset of L);
thus X is  directed
proof
A2: (the carrier of S) c= (the carrier of L) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
let x being (Element of S);
let y being (Element of S);
assume that
A3: x in X
and
A4: y in X;
A5: y in (the carrier of S) by A3;
x in (the carrier of S) by A3;
then reconsider x9 = x,y9 = y as (Element of L) by A5,A2;
consider z being (Element of L) such that A6: z in X and A7: z >= x9 and A8: z >= y9 by A1,A3,A4,WAYBEL_0:def 1;
reconsider z as (Element of S) by A6;
take z;
thus thesis by A6,A7,A8,YELLOW_0:60;
end;

end;
assume A9: X is  filtered  filtered (Subset of L);
A10: (the carrier of S) c= (the carrier of L) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
let x being (Element of S);
let y being (Element of S);
assume that
A11: x in X
and
A12: y in X;
A13: y in (the carrier of S) by A11;
x in (the carrier of S) by A11;
then reconsider x9 = x,y9 = y as (Element of L) by A13,A10;
consider z being (Element of L) such that A14: z in X and A15: z <= x9 and A16: z <= y9 by A9,A11,A12,WAYBEL_0:def 2;
reconsider z as (Element of S) by A14;
take z;
thus thesis by A14,A15,A16,YELLOW_0:60;
