theorem
Th4: (for L,S being RelStr holds ((S is  full  full (SubRelStr of L) iff ( S opp ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( L opp ))) & (( S opp ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of L) iff S is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( L opp )))))
proof
let L being RelStr;
let S being RelStr;
A1: ( ( (the InternalRel of L) |_2 (the carrier of S) ) ~ ) = ( ( (the InternalRel of L) ~ ) |_2 (the carrier of S) ) by ORDERS_1:83;
hereby
assume A2: S is  full  full (SubRelStr of L);
then (the InternalRel of S) = ( (the InternalRel of L) |_2 (the carrier of S) ) by YELLOW_0:def 14;
hence ( S opp ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( L opp )) by A1,A2,CKB6:1,YELLOW_0:def 14;
end;
A3: ( ( ( (the InternalRel of L) ~ ) |_2 (the carrier of S) ) ~ ) = ( ( ( (the InternalRel of L) ~ ) ~ ) |_2 (the carrier of S) ) by ORDERS_1:83;
hereby
assume A4: ( S opp ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( L opp ));
then (the InternalRel of ( S opp )) = ( (the InternalRel of ( L opp )) |_2 (the carrier of S) ) by YELLOW_0:def 14;
hence S is  full  full (SubRelStr of L) by A3,A4,CKB6:1,YELLOW_0:def 14;
end;
hereby
assume A5: ( S opp ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of L);
then (the InternalRel of ( S opp )) = ( (the InternalRel of L) |_2 (the carrier of S) ) by YELLOW_0:def 14;
hence S is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( L opp )) by A1,A5,CKB6:1,YELLOW_0:def 14;
end;
assume A6: S is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( L opp ));
then (the InternalRel of S) = ( (the InternalRel of ( L opp )) |_2 (the carrier of S) ) by YELLOW_0:def 14;
hence thesis by A1,A6,CKB6:1,YELLOW_0:def 14;
