theorem
Th3: (for L,S being RelStr holds ((S is (SubRelStr of L) iff ( S opp ) is (SubRelStr of ( L opp ))) & (( S opp ) is (SubRelStr of L) iff S is (SubRelStr of ( L opp )))))
proof
let L being RelStr,S being RelStr;
thus (S is (SubRelStr of L) implies ( S opp ) is (SubRelStr of ( L opp )))
proof
assume that
A1: (the carrier of S) c= (the carrier of L)
and
A2: (the InternalRel of S) c= (the InternalRel of L);
thus ((the carrier of ( S opp )) c= (the carrier of ( L opp )) & (the InternalRel of ( S opp )) c= (the InternalRel of ( L opp ))) by A1,A2,CKB5:1;
end;

thus (( S opp ) is (SubRelStr of ( L opp )) implies S is (SubRelStr of L))
proof
assume that
A3: (the carrier of ( S opp )) c= (the carrier of ( L opp ))
and
A4: (the InternalRel of ( S opp )) c= (the InternalRel of ( L opp ));
thus ((the carrier of S) c= (the carrier of L) & (the InternalRel of S) c= (the InternalRel of L)) by A3,A4,CKB5:1;
end;

thus (( S opp ) is (SubRelStr of L) implies S is (SubRelStr of ( L opp )))
proof
assume that
A5: (the carrier of ( S opp )) c= (the carrier of L)
and
A6: (the InternalRel of ( S opp )) c= (the InternalRel of L);
thus ((the carrier of S) c= (the carrier of ( L opp )) & (the InternalRel of S) c= (the InternalRel of ( L opp ))) by A5,A6,CKB5:1;
end;

assume that
A7: (the carrier of S) c= (the carrier of ( L opp ))
and
A8: (the InternalRel of S) c= (the InternalRel of ( L opp ));
thus ((the carrier of ( S opp )) c= (the carrier of L) & (the InternalRel of ( S opp )) c= (the InternalRel of L)) by A7,A8,CKB5:1;
end;
