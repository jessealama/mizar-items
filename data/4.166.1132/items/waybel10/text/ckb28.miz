theorem
Th15: (for L being  complete LATTICE holds (for c1,c2 being  closure (Function of L,L) holds (c1 <= c2 iff ( Image c2 ) is (SubRelStr of ( Image c1 )))))
proof
let L being  complete LATTICE;
let c1 being  closure (Function of L,L);
let c2 being  closure (Function of L,L);
hereby
assume A1: c1 <= c2;
(the carrier of ( Image c2 )) c= (the carrier of ( Image c1 ))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of ( Image c2 ));
then consider y being (Element of L) such that A2: ( c2 . y ) = x by YELLOW_2:10;
A3: ( c2 . ( c2 . y ) ) = ( c2 . y ) by YELLOW_2:18;
A4: ( c1 . ( c2 . y ) ) <= ( c2 . ( c2 . y ) ) by A1,YELLOW_2:9;
( c2 . y ) <= ( c1 . ( c2 . y ) ) by CKB16:1;
then ( c1 . ( c2 . y ) ) = x by A2,A4,A3,ORDERS_2:2;
then x in ( rng c1 ) by FUNCT_2:4;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:def 15;
end;
hence ( Image c2 ) is (SubRelStr of ( Image c1 )) by CKB27:1;
end;
assume that
A5: (the carrier of ( Image c2 )) c= (the carrier of ( Image c1 ))
and
(the InternalRel of ( Image c2 )) c= (the InternalRel of ( Image c1 ));
now
let x being (Element of L);
( c2 . x ) in ( rng c2 ) by FUNCT_2:4;
then ( c2 . x ) in (the carrier of ( Image c2 )) by YELLOW_0:def 15;
then (ex a being (Element of L) st ( c1 . a ) = ( c2 . x )) by A5,YELLOW_2:10;
then A6: ( c1 . ( c2 . x ) ) = ( c2 . x ) by YELLOW_2:18;
x <= ( c2 . x ) by CKB16:1;
hence ( c1 . x ) <= ( c2 . x ) by A6,WAYBEL_1:def 2;
end;
hence thesis by YELLOW_2:9;
end;
