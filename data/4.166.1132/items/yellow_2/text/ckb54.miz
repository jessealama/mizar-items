theorem
Th47: (for L being  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice holds (for X being non  empty (Subset of ( Ids L )) holds ( meet X ) is (Ideal of L)))
proof
let L being  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice;
let X being non  empty (Subset of ( Ids L ));
A1: (for J being set holds (J in X implies J is (Ideal of L)))
proof
let J being set;
assume J in X;
then J in ( Ids L );
then (ex Y being (Ideal of L) st Y = J);
hence thesis;
end;
X c= ( bool (the carrier of L) )
proof
let x;
assume x in X;
then x is (Ideal of L) by A1;
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider F = X as (Subset-Family of L);
(for J being (Subset of L) holds (J in F implies J is  lower)) by A1;
then reconsider I = ( meet X ) as  lower (Subset of L) by CKB42:1;
(for J being set holds (J in X implies ( Bottom L ) in J))
proof
let J being set;
assume J in X;
then reconsider J9 = J as (Ideal of L) by A1;
set j = the (Element of J9);
( Bottom L ) <= j by YELLOW_0:44;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:def 19;
end;
then reconsider I as non  empty  lower (Subset of L) by SETFAM_1:def 1;
(for J being (Subset of L) holds (J in F implies J is  lower  directed)) by A1;
then I is (Ideal of L) by CKB44:1;
