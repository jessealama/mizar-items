theorem
(for L being non  empty RelStr holds (for S,T being non  empty  full (SubRelStr of L) holds ((the carrier of S) c= (the carrier of T) implies (for X being (Subset of S) holds (X is (Subset of T) & (for Y being (Subset of T) holds (X = Y implies ((X is  filtered implies Y is  filtered) & (X is  directed implies Y is  directed)))))))))
proof
let L being non  empty RelStr;
let S1 being non  empty  full (SubRelStr of L);
let S2 being non  empty  full (SubRelStr of L);
assume A1: (the carrier of S1) c= (the carrier of S2);
let X being (Subset of S1);
thus X is (Subset of S2) by A1,XBOOLE_1:1;
let X2 being (Subset of S2);
assume that
A2: X = X2;
hereby
assume A3: X is  filtered;
thus X2 is  filtered
proof
let x being (Element of S2);
let y being (Element of S2);
assume A4: (x in X2 & y in X2);
then reconsider x9 = x,y9 = y as (Element of S1) by A2;
consider z being (Element of S1) such that A5: z in X and A6: (z <= x9 & z <= y9) by A2,A3,A4,WAYBEL_0:def 2;
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y,z1 = z as (Element of L) by YELLOW_0:58;
reconsider z as (Element of S2) by A2,A5;
take z;
(z1 <= x1 & z1 <= y1) by A6,YELLOW_0:59;
hence thesis by A2,A5,YELLOW_0:60;
end;

end;
assume A7: X is  directed;
let x being (Element of S2);
let y being (Element of S2);
assume A8: (x in X2 & y in X2);
then reconsider x9 = x,y9 = y as (Element of S1) by A2;
consider z being (Element of S1) such that A9: z in X and A10: (x9 <= z & y9 <= z) by A2,A7,A8,WAYBEL_0:def 1;
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y,z1 = z as (Element of L) by YELLOW_0:58;
reconsider z as (Element of S2) by A2,A9;
take z;
(x1 <= z1 & y1 <= z1) by A10,YELLOW_0:59;
hence thesis by A2,A9,YELLOW_0:60;
