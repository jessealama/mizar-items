theorem
(for L being  with_infima  antisymmetric RelStr holds (for F being (Subset-Family of L) holds ((for X being (Subset of L) holds (X in F implies X is  upper  filtered)) implies ( meet F ) is  filtered  filtered (Subset of L))))
proof
let L being  with_infima  antisymmetric RelStr;
let F being (Subset-Family of L);
assume A1: (for X being (Subset of L) holds (X in F implies X is  upper  filtered));
reconsider F9 = F as (Subset-Family of L);
reconsider M = ( meet F9 ) as (Subset of L);
per cases ;
suppose A2: F = ( {} );

M is  filtered
proof
let x being (Element of L);
let y being (Element of L);
assume that
A3: x in M
and
y in M;
thus thesis by A2,A3,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
suppose A4: F <> ( {} );

M is  filtered
proof
let x being (Element of L);
let y being (Element of L);
assume that
A5: x in M
and
A6: y in M;
take z = ( x "/\" y );
(for Y being set holds (Y in F implies z in Y))
proof
let Y being set;
assume A7: Y in F;
then reconsider X = Y as (Subset of L);
A8: y in X by A6,A7,SETFAM_1:def 1;
(X is  upper  filtered & x in X) by A1,A5,A7,SETFAM_1:def 1;
hence thesis by A8,WAYBEL_0:41;
end;
hence z in M by A4,SETFAM_1:def 1;
thus thesis by YELLOW_0:23;
end;
hence thesis;
