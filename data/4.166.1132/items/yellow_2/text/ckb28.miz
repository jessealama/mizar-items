theorem
Th25: (for L being non  empty RelStr holds ((for X holds  ex_sup_of X,L) iff (for Y holds  ex_inf_of Y,L)))
proof
let L being non  empty RelStr;
hereby
assume A1: (for X holds  ex_sup_of X,L);
let Y;
set X = { x where x is (Element of L): x is_<=_than Y };
 ex_sup_of X,L by A1;
then consider a being (Element of L) such that A2: X is_<=_than a and A3: (for b being (Element of L) holds (X is_<=_than b implies b >= a)) and A4: (for c being (Element of L) holds ((X is_<=_than c & (for b being (Element of L) holds (X is_<=_than b implies b >= c))) implies c = a)) by YELLOW_0:def 7;
A5: a is_<=_than Y
proof
let b being (Element of L);
assume A6: b in Y;
b is_>=_than X
proof
let c being (Element of L);
assume c in X;
then (ex x being (Element of L) st (c = x & x is_<=_than Y));
hence thesis by A6,LATTICE3:def 8;
end;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
A7: (for c being (Element of L) holds ((Y is_>=_than c & (for b being (Element of L) holds (Y is_>=_than b implies b <= c))) implies c = a))
proof
let c being (Element of L);
assume that
A8: Y is_>=_than c
and
A9: (for b being (Element of L) holds (Y is_>=_than b implies b <= c));
A10: (for b being (Element of L) holds (X is_<=_than b implies b >= c))
proof
let b being (Element of L);
assume A11: X is_<=_than b;
c in X by A8;
hence thesis by A11,LATTICE3:def 9;
end;
X is_<=_than c
proof
let b being (Element of L);
assume b in X;
then (ex x being (Element of L) st (b = x & x is_<=_than Y));

proof
let b being (Element of L);
assume b is_<=_than Y;

A16: X is_<=_than a
proof
let b being (Element of L);
assume A17: b in X;
b is_<=_than Y
proof
let c being (Element of L);
assume c in Y;
then (ex y being (Element of L) st (c = y & X is_<=_than y));
hence thesis by A17,LATTICE3:def 9;
end;
hence thesis by A14;
end;
A18: (for c being (Element of L) holds ((X is_<=_than c & (for b being (Element of L) holds (X is_<=_than b implies b >= c))) implies c = a))
proof
let c being (Element of L);
assume that
A19: X is_<=_than c
and
A20: (for b being (Element of L) holds (X is_<=_than b implies b >= c));
A21: (for b being (Element of L) holds (Y is_>=_than b implies b <= c))
proof
let b being (Element of L);
assume A22: Y is_>=_than b;
c in Y by A19;
hence thesis by A22,LATTICE3:def 8;
end;
Y is_>=_than c
proof
let b being (Element of L);
assume b in Y;
then (ex x being (Element of L) st (b = x & x is_>=_than X));
hence thesis by A20;
end;
hence thesis by A15,A21;
end;
(for b being (Element of L) holds (X is_<=_than b implies a <= b))
proof
let b being (Element of L);
assume X is_<=_than b;
