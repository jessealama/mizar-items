theorem
(for S,T being non empty RelStr holds (for f being (Function of S,T) holds (for X being  directed (Subset of S) holds (f is  monotone implies ( f .: X ) is  directed))))
proof
let S being non empty RelStr,T being non empty RelStr;
let f being (Function of S,T);
let X being  directed (Subset of S);
set Y = ( f .: X );
assume A1: f is  monotone;
(for y1,y2 being (Element of T) holds ((y1 in Y & y2 in Y) implies (ex z being (Element of T) st ((z in Y & y1 <= z) & y2 <= z))))
proof
let y1 being (Element of T),y2 being (Element of T);
assume that
A2: y1 in Y
and
A3: y2 in Y;
consider x1 being set such that x1 in ( dom f ) and A4: x1 in X and A5: y1 = ( f . x1 ) by A2,FUNCT_1:def 6;
consider x2 being set such that x2 in ( dom f ) and A6: x2 in X and A7: y2 = ( f . x2 ) by A3,FUNCT_1:def 6;
reconsider x1,x2 as (Element of S) by A4,A6;
consider z being (Element of S) such that A8: z in X and A9: (x1 <= z & x2 <= z) by A4,A6,WAYBEL_0:def 1;
take ( f . z );
thus ( f . z ) in Y by A8,FUNCT_2:35;
thus thesis by A1,A5,A7,A9,ORDERS_3:def 5;
end;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:def 1;
end;
