let L being non  empty 1-sorted;

let i being (Element of N);
func N | i ->  strict NetStr over L means

existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex y being (Element of N) st (y = $1 & i <= y));
consider X being set such that A1: (for x being set holds (x in X iff (x in (the carrier of N) & P[ x ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
X c= (the carrier of N)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in X;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
then reconsider f = ( (the mapping of N) | X ) as (Function of X,(the carrier of L)) by FUNCT_2:32;
set IT = NetStr (# X,( (the InternalRel of N) |_2 X ),f #);
take IT;
thus (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of IT) iff (ex y being (Element of N) st (y = x & i <= y)))) by A1;
thus thesis;

uniqueness
proof

 means
(ex y being (Element of N) st (y = $1 & i <= y));
let A being  strict NetStr over L;
let B being  strict NetStr over L;
assume that

and

and
A4: (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of B) iff P[ x ]))
and
A5: ((the InternalRel of B) = ( (the InternalRel of N) |_2 (the carrier of B) ) & (the mapping of B) = ( (the mapping of N) | (the carrier of B) ));
(the carrier of A) = (the carrier of B) from XBOOLE_0:sch 2(A2,A4);
hence thesis by A3,A5;
