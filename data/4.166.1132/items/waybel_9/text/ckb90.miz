theorem
Lm5: (for S being  compact  Hausdorff TopLattice holds (for N being (net of S) holds (for c being (Point of S) holds (for d being (Element of S) holds ((((c = d & (for x being (Element of S) holds ( x "/\" ) is  continuous)) & N is  eventually-directed) & c is_a_cluster_point_of N) implies d is_>=_than ( rng (the mapping of N) ))))))
proof
let S being  compact  Hausdorff TopLattice;
let N being (net of S);
let c being (Point of S);
let d being (Element of S);
assume that
A1: c = d
and
A2: (for x being (Element of S) holds ( x "/\" ) is  continuous)
and
A3: N is  eventually-directed
and
A4: c is_a_cluster_point_of N;
let i being (Element of S);
assume i in ( rng (the mapping of N) );
then consider iJ being set such that A5: iJ in ( dom (the mapping of N) ) and A6: ( (the mapping of N) . iJ ) = i by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider i1 = iJ as (Element of N) by A5;
( uparrow ( N . i1 ) ) is  closed by A2,CKB81:1;
then A7: ( Cl ( uparrow ( N . i1 ) ) ) = ( uparrow ( N . i1 ) ) by PRE_TOPC:22;
N is_eventually_in ( uparrow ( N . i1 ) )
proof
consider j being (Element of N) such that A8: (for k being (Element of N) holds (j <= k implies ( N . i1 ) <= ( N . k ))) by A3,WAYBEL_0:11;
take j;
let k being (Element of N);
assume j <= k;
then ( N . i1 ) <= ( N . k ) by A8;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:18;
end;
then consider t being (Element of N) such that A9: (for j being (Element of N) holds (t <= j implies ( N . j ) in ( uparrow ( N . i1 ) ))) by WAYBEL_0:def 11;
reconsider A = ( N | t ) as (subnet of N);
A10: ( rng (the mapping of A) ) c= ( uparrow ( N . i1 ) )
proof
let q being set;
assume q in ( rng (the mapping of A) );
then consider x being set such that A11: x in ( dom (the mapping of A) ) and A12: q = ( (the mapping of A) . x ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider x as (Element of A) by A11;
consider y being (Element of N) such that A13: y = x and A14: t <= y by CKB42:def 1;
( A . x ) = ( N . y ) by A13,CKB53:1;
hence thesis by A9,A12,A14;
end;
c is_a_cluster_point_of A
proof
let O being (a_neighborhood of c);
let i being (Element of A);
consider i2 being (Element of N) such that A15: i2 = i and A16: t <= i2 by CKB42:def 1;
N is_often_in O by A4,CKB83:def 1;
then consider j2 being (Element of N) such that A17: i2 <= j2 and A18: ( N . j2 ) in O by WAYBEL_0:def 12;
t <= j2 by A16,A17,YELLOW_0:def 2;
then reconsider j = j2 as (Element of A) by CKB42:def 1;
take j;
A is  full  full (SubNetStr of N) by CKB45:1;
hence i <= j by A15,A17,YELLOW_6:12;
thus thesis by A18,CKB53:1;
end;
then consider M being (subnet of A) such that A19: c in ( Lim M ) by CKB87:1;
reconsider R = ( rng (the mapping of M) ) as (Subset of S);
A20: ( uparrow ( N . i1 ) ) = { z where z is (Element of S): ( z "/\" ( N . i1 ) ) = ( N . i1 ) } by CKB6:1;
(ex f being (Function of M,A) st ((the mapping of M) = ( (the mapping of A) * f ) & (for m being (Element of A) holds (ex n being (Element of M) st (for p being (Element of M) holds (n <= p implies m <= ( f . p ))))))) by YELLOW_6:def 9;
then R c= ( rng (the mapping of A) ) by RELAT_1:26;
then R c= ( uparrow ( N . i1 ) ) by A10,XBOOLE_1:1;
then A21: ( Cl R ) c= ( Cl ( uparrow ( N . i1 ) ) ) by PRE_TOPC:19;
c in ( Cl R ) by A19,CKB78:1;
then c in ( uparrow ( N . i1 ) ) by A7,A21;
then (ex z being (Element of S) st (c = z & ( z "/\" ( N . i1 ) ) = ( N . i1 ))) by A20;
hence thesis by A1,A6,YELLOW_0:25;
