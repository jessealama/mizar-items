theorem
Th17: (for I being non empty set holds (for A being  PLS-yielding (ManySortedSet of I) holds (for p,q being (Point of ( Segre_Product A )) holds (p <> q implies (p,q are_collinear  iff (for p1,q1 being (ManySortedSet of I) holds ((p1 = p & q1 = q) implies (ex i being (Element of I) st ((for a,b being (Point of ( A . i )) holds ((a = ( p1 . i ) & b = ( q1 . i )) implies (a <> b & a,b are_collinear ))) & (for j being (Element of I) holds (j <> i implies ( p1 . j ) = ( q1 . j ))))))))))))
proof
let I being non empty set;
let A being  PLS-yielding (ManySortedSet of I);
let p being (Point of ( Segre_Product A )),q being (Point of ( Segre_Product A ));
assume A1: p <> q;
thus (p,q are_collinear  implies (for p1,q1 being (ManySortedSet of I) holds ((p1 = p & q1 = q) implies (ex i being (Element of I) st ((for a,b being (Point of ( A . i )) holds ((a = ( p1 . i ) & b = ( q1 . i )) implies (a <> b & a,b are_collinear ))) & (for j being (Element of I) holds (j <> i implies ( p1 . j ) = ( q1 . j ))))))))
proof
assume p,q are_collinear ;
then consider l being (Block of ( Segre_Product A )) such that A2: { p,q } c= l by A1,PENCIL_1:def 1;
let p1 being (ManySortedSet of I),q1 being (ManySortedSet of I);
assume that
A3: p1 = p
and
A4: q1 = q;
A5: q1 in l by A2,A4,ZFMISC_1:32;
consider L being  Segre-like non trivial-yielding (ManySortedSubset of ( Carrier A )) such that A6: l = ( product L ) and A7: ( L . ( indx L ) ) is (Block of ( A . ( indx L ) )) by PENCIL_1:24;
take i = ( indx L );
A8: p1 in l by A2,A3,ZFMISC_1:32;
thus (for a,b being (Point of ( A . i )) holds ((a = ( p1 . i ) & b = ( q1 . i )) implies (a <> b & a,b are_collinear )))
proof
reconsider LI = ( L . ( indx L ) ) as (Block of ( A . ( indx L ) )) by A7;

hence ( p1 . o ) = ( q1 . o ) by A11,A12;
end;
suppose o1 <> i;

then ( L . o1 ) is 1 -element by PENCIL_1:12;
then consider s being set such that A15: ( L . o1 ) = { s } by ZFMISC_1:131;

then A16: ( p1 . o ) = s by TARSKI:def 1;
