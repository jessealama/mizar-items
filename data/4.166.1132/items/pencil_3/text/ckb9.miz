theorem
Th9: (for I being non empty set holds (for i being (Element of I) holds (for A being  non-Trivial-yielding  TopStruct-yielding (ManySortedSet of I) holds (for p being (Point of ( Segre_Product A )) holds (ex L being  Segre-like non trivial-yielding (ManySortedSubset of ( Carrier A )) st ((( indx L ) = i & ( product L ) is (Segre-Coset of A)) & p in ( product L )))))))
proof
let I being non empty set;
let x being (Element of I);
let A being  non-Trivial-yielding  TopStruct-yielding (ManySortedSet of I);
let p0 being (Point of ( Segre_Product A ));
( dom A ) = I by PARTFUN1:def 2;
then ( A . x ) in ( rng A ) by FUNCT_1:3;
then ( A . x ) is non trivial by PENCIL_1:def 18;
then reconsider C = ( [#] ( A . x ) ) as non trivial set;
reconsider p09 = p0 as (Element of ( Carrier A )) by CKB6:1;
reconsider p = { p09 } as (ManySortedSubset of ( Carrier A )) by PENCIL_1:11;
reconsider b = ( p +* (x,C) ) as  Segre-like non trivial-yielding (ManySortedSubset of ( Carrier A )) by PENCIL_1:9,PENCIL_1:10,PENCIL_2:7;
take b;
( dom p ) = I by PARTFUN1:def 2;
then A1: ( b . x ) = C by FUNCT_7:31;
hence A2: ( indx b ) = x by PENCIL_1:def 21;
( product b ) c= (the carrier of ( Segre_Product A ))
proof
let a being set;
assume a in ( product b );
then consider f being Function such that A3: a = f and A4: ( dom f ) = ( dom b ) and A5: (for x being set holds (x in ( dom b ) implies ( f . x ) in ( b . x ))) by CARD_3:def 5;
( dom ( Carrier A ) ) = I by PARTFUN1:def 2;
then A6: ( dom f ) = ( dom ( Carrier A ) ) by A4,PARTFUN1:def 2;
A7:now
let i being set;
assume A8: i in ( dom ( Carrier A ) );
then reconsider i1 = i as (Element of I) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
A9: ( f . i ) in ( b . i ) by A4,A5,A6,A8;
per cases ;
suppose i1 = x;

hence ( f . i ) in ( ( Carrier A ) . i ) by A1,A9,CKB7:1;
end;
suppose A10: i1 <> x;

I = ( dom A ) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
then ( A . i1 ) in ( rng A ) by FUNCT_1:3;
then ( A . i1 ) is non trivial by PENCIL_1:def 18;
then reconsider AA = (the carrier of ( A . i1 )) as non trivial set;
( f . i1 ) in ( p . i1 ) by A9,A10,FUNCT_7:32;
then ( f . i1 ) in { ( p09 . i1 ) } by PZFMISC1:def 1;
then ( f . i1 ) = ( p09 . i1 ) by TARSKI:def 1;
then A11: ( f . i1 ) is (Element of ( ( Carrier A ) . i1 )) by PBOOLE:def 14;
AA is non empty;
then ( [#] ( A . i1 ) ) is non empty;
then ( ( Carrier A ) . i1 ) is non empty by CKB7:1;
hence ( f . i ) in ( ( Carrier A ) . i ) by A11;
end;
end;
( Segre_Product A ) = TopStruct (# ( product ( Carrier A ) ),( Segre_Blocks A ) #) by PENCIL_1:def 23;
hence thesis by A3,A6,A7,CARD_3:def 5;
end;
hence ( product b ) is (Segre-Coset of A) by A1,A2,PENCIL_2:def 2;
A12: ( dom p ) = I by PARTFUN1:def 2;
A13:now
let z being set;
assume A14: z in I;
then reconsider z1 = z as (Element of I);
( dom A ) = I by PARTFUN1:def 2;
then ( A . z ) in ( rng A ) by A14,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then ( A . z ) is non trivial non trivial 1-sorted by PENCIL_1:def 18;
then reconsider tc = (the carrier of ( A . z1 )) as non trivial set;
A15: tc is non empty;
per cases ;
suppose A16: z = x;

( p09 . z1 ) is (Element of ( ( Carrier A ) . z1 )) by PBOOLE:def 14;
then ( p09 . z1 ) is (Element of ( [#] ( A . z1 ) )) by CKB7:1;
then ( p09 . z1 ) in (the carrier of ( A . z1 )) by A15;
hence ( p09 . z ) in ( ( p +* (x,C) ) . z ) by A12,A16,FUNCT_7:31;
end;
suppose z <> x;

then ( ( p +* (x,C) ) . z ) = ( p . z ) by FUNCT_7:32;
then ( ( p +* (x,C) ) . z ) = { ( p09 . z ) } by A14,PZFMISC1:def 1;
hence ( p09 . z ) in ( ( p +* (x,C) ) . z ) by TARSKI:def 1;
end;
end;
(( dom p09 ) = I & ( dom ( p +* (x,C) ) ) = I) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
hence thesis by A13,CARD_3:9;
