theorem
Th38: ((G in ( rng ( tree_of_subformulae F ) ) & H is_subformula_of G) implies H in ( rng ( tree_of_subformulae F ) ))
proof
assume that
A1: G in ( rng ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )
and
A2: H is_subformula_of G;
consider n being (Element of ( NAT )),L being FinSequence such that A3: 1 <= n and A4: ( len L ) = n and A5: ( L . 1 ) = H and A6: ( L . n ) = G and A7: (for k holds ((1 <= k & k < n) implies (ex H1,G1 being (Element of ( QC-WFF )) st ((( L . k ) = H1 & ( L . ( k + 1 ) ) = G1) & H1 is_immediate_constituent_of G1)))) by A2,QC_LANG2:def 20;
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
(ex H9 st ((H9 = ( L . ( $1 + 1 ) ) & ( $1 + 1 ) in ( dom L )) & H9 in ( rng ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )));
A8: (for k being Nat holds ((k <> ( 0 ) & P[ k ]) implies (ex m being Nat st (m < k & P[ m ]))))
proof
A9: ( Seg n ) = ( dom L ) by A4,FINSEQ_1:def 3;
let k being Nat;
assume that
A10: k <> ( 0 )
and
A11: P[ k ];
consider m being Nat such that A12: ( m + 1 ) = k by A10,NAT_1:6;
( 0 ) < k by A10,NAT_1:3;
then A13: ( ( 0 ) + 1 ) <= k by NAT_1:13;
( Seg ( len L ) ) = ( dom L ) by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
then A14: ( k + 1 ) <= n by A4,A11,FINSEQ_1:1;
then (k in ( NAT ) & k < n) by NAT_1:13,ORDINAL1:def 12;
then A15: (ex H1,G1 being (Element of ( QC-WFF )) st ((( L . k ) = H1 & ( L . ( k + 1 ) ) = G1) & H1 is_immediate_constituent_of G1)) by A7,A13;
k <= n by A14,NAT_1:13;
then A16: k in ( dom L ) by A13,A9,FINSEQ_1:1;
m < k by A12,NAT_1:13;
hence thesis by A11,A12,A15,A16,CKB10:1;
end;
A17: (ex k being Nat st P[ k ])
proof
( 0 ) <> n by A3;
then A18: (ex k being Nat st ( k + 1 ) = n) by NAT_1:6;
( Seg n ) = ( dom L ) by A4,FINSEQ_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A1,A6,A18,FINSEQ_1:3;
end;
P[ ( 0 ) ] from NAT_1:sch 7(A17,A8);
hence thesis by A5;
