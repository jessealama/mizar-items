theorem
Th60: ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) | t ) = ( tree_of_subformulae ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) )
proof
set T1 = ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) | t );
set T2 = ( tree_of_subformulae ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) );
thus A1: ( dom T1 ) = ( dom T2 )
proof
let p being (FinSequence of ( NAT ));
now
consider G such that A2: G = ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t );
A3: t in ( F -entry_points_in_subformula_tree_of G ) by A2,CKB21:def 1;
consider t9 being (FinSequence of ( NAT )) such that A4: t9 = ( t ^ p );
assume p in ( dom T1 );
then p in ( ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) ) | t ) by TREES_2:def 10;
then reconsider t9 as (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )) by A4,TREES_1:def 6;
consider H such that A5: H = ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t9 );
A6: ( G -entry_points_in_subformula_tree_of H ) c= ( dom T2 ) by A2,TREES_1:def 11;
t9 in ( F -entry_points_in_subformula_tree_of H ) by A5,CKB21:def 1;
then p in ( G -entry_points_in_subformula_tree_of H ) by A3,A4,CKB32:1;
hence p in ( dom T2 ) by A6;
end;
hence (p in ( dom T1 ) implies p in ( dom T2 ));
now
consider G such that A7: G = ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t );
assume p in ( dom T2 );
then reconsider s = p as (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae G ) )) by A7;
consider H such that A8: H = ( ( tree_of_subformulae G ) . s );
A9: s in ( G -entry_points_in_subformula_tree_of H ) by A8,CKB21:def 1;
A10: ( F -entry_points_in_subformula_tree_of H ) c= ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) ) by TREES_1:def 11;
t in ( F -entry_points_in_subformula_tree_of G ) by A7,CKB21:def 1;
then ( t ^ s ) in ( F -entry_points_in_subformula_tree_of H ) by A9,CKB31:1;
then s in ( ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) ) | t ) by A10,TREES_1:def 6;
hence p in ( dom T1 ) by TREES_2:def 10;
end;
hence thesis;
end;

now
let p being (Node of T1);
consider G such that A11: G = ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t );
reconsider s = p as (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae G ) )) by A1,A11;
A12: ( dom T1 ) = ( ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) ) | t ) by TREES_2:def 10;
then reconsider t9 = ( t ^ s ) as (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )) by TREES_1:def 6;
consider H such that A13: H = ( T1 . p );
A14: t in ( F -entry_points_in_subformula_tree_of G ) by A11,CKB21:def 1;
( T1 . p ) = ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . ( t ^ p ) ) by A12,TREES_2:def 10;
then t9 in ( F -entry_points_in_subformula_tree_of H ) by A13,CKB21:def 1;
then s in ( G -entry_points_in_subformula_tree_of H ) by A14,CKB32:1;
hence ( T1 . p ) = ( T2 . p ) by A11,A13,CKB21:def 1;
end;
hence (for p being (Node of T1) holds ( T1 . p ) = ( T2 . p ));
end;
