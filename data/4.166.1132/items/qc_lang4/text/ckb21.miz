definition
let F being (Element of ( QC-WFF ));
let G being (Element of ( QC-WFF ));
func F -entry_points_in_subformula_tree_of G -> (AntiChain_of_Prefixes of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )) means 
:Def3: (for t being (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )) holds (t in it iff ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) = G));
existence
proof
consider X being set such that A1: X = { t where t is (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )): ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) = G };
A2: X is (AntiChain_of_Prefixes of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) ))
proof
A3: (for p1,p2 being FinSequence holds (((p1 in X & p2 in X) & p1 <> p2) implies (not p1,p2 are_c=-comparable )))
proof
let p1 being FinSequence;
let p2 being FinSequence;
assume that
A4: (p1 in X & p2 in X)
and
A5: p1 <> p2;
((ex t1 being (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )) st (t1 = p1 & ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t1 ) = G)) & (ex t2 being (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )) st (t2 = p2 & ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t2 ) = G))) by A1,A4;
hence thesis by A5,CKB20:1;
end;
(for x being set holds (x in X implies x is FinSequence))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in X;
then (ex t being (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )) st (t = x & ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) = G)) by A1;
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider X as AntiChain_of_Prefixes by A3,TREES_1:def 10;
X c= ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in X;
then (ex t being (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )) st (t = x & ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) = G)) by A1;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by TREES_1:def 11;
end;
(for t being (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )) holds (t in X iff ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) = G))
proof
let t being (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) ));
thus (t in X iff ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) = G)
proof
now
assume t in X;
then (ex t9 being (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )) st (t9 = t & ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t9 ) = G)) by A1;
hence ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) = G;
end;
hence (t in X implies ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) = G);
assume ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) = G;
hence thesis by A1;
end;

end;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let P1 being (AntiChain_of_Prefixes of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) ));
let P2 being (AntiChain_of_Prefixes of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) ));
assume A6: (for t being (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )) holds (t in P1 iff ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) = G));
assume A7: (for t being (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )) holds (t in P2 iff ( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) = G));
thus P1 c= P2
proof
let x being set;
assume that
A8: x in P1;
P1 c= ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) ) by TREES_1:def 11;
then reconsider t = x as (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )) by A8;
( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) = G by A6,A8;
hence thesis by A7;
end;

thus P2 c= P1
proof
let x being set;
assume that
A9: x in P2;
P2 c= ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) ) by TREES_1:def 11;
then reconsider t = x as (Element of ( dom ( tree_of_subformulae F ) )) by A9;
( ( tree_of_subformulae F ) . t ) = G by A7,A9;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
