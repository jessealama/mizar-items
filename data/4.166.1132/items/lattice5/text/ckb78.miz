FD is  zeroed
proof
let x being (Element of FS);
consider y being set such that A92: x in y and A93: y in X by A1,TARSKI:def 4;
consider j being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A94: y = ( ( S . j ) `1 ) by A93;
consider A1 being non  empty set,d1 being (distance_function of A1,L),Aq1 being non  empty set,dq1 being (distance_function of Aq1,L) such that Aq1,dq1 is_extension_of A1,d1 and A95: ( S . j ) = [ A1,d1 ] and ( S . ( j + 1 ) ) = [ Aq1,dq1 ] by CKB73:def 1;
reconsider x9 = x as (Element of A1) by A92,A94,A95,MCART_1:def 1;
( ( S . j ) `2 ) = d1 by A95,MCART_1:def 2;
then d1 in { ( ( S . i ) `2 ) where i is (Element of ( NAT )): (not contradiction) };
then A96: d1 c= FD by ZFMISC_1:74;
( dom d1 ) = [: A1,A1 :] by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence ( FD . (x,x) ) = ( d1 . [ x9,x9 ] ) by A96,GRFUNC_1:2
.= ( d1 . (x9,x9) )
.= ( Bottom L ) by CKB28:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by A38,A55;
