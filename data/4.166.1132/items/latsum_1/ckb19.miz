theorem
Th15: (for R,S being non empty RelStr holds (for a,b being (Element of R) holds (for c,d being (Element of S) holds (((((a = c & b = d) & R tolerates S) & R is  transitive) & S is  transitive) implies (a <= b iff c <= d)))))
proof
let R being non empty RelStr,S being non empty RelStr;
let a being (Element of R),b being (Element of R);
let c being (Element of S),d being (Element of S);
assume that
A1: (a = c & b = d)
and
A2: R tolerates S
and
A3: R is  transitive
and
A4: S is  transitive;
(a in ( (the carrier of R) \/ (the carrier of S) ) & b in ( (the carrier of R) \/ (the carrier of S) )) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then reconsider a9 = a,b9 = b as (Element of ( R [*] S )) by CKB3:def 1;
hereby
assume a <= b;
then a9 <= b9 by A2,A3,CKB12:1;
hence c <= d by A1,A2,A4,CKB13:1;
end;
assume c <= d;
then a9 <= b9 by A1,A2,A4,CKB13:1;
hence thesis by A2,A3,CKB12:1;
end;
