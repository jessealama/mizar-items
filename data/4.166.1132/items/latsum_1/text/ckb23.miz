theorem
(for R,S being  antisymmetric  reflexive  transitive  with_suprema non  empty RelStr holds (for x,y being (Element of R) holds (for a,b being (Element of S) holds (((((( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) ) is  lower  directed  lower  directed (Subset of S) & ( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) ) is  upper  upper (Subset of R)) & R tolerates S) & x = a) & y = b) implies ( x "\/" y ) = ( a "\/" b )))))
proof
let R being  antisymmetric  reflexive  transitive  with_suprema non  empty RelStr;
let S being  antisymmetric  reflexive  transitive  with_suprema non  empty RelStr;
let x being (Element of R);
let y being (Element of R);
let a being (Element of S);
let b being (Element of S);
assume that
A1: ( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) ) is  lower  directed  lower  directed (Subset of S)
and
A2: ( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) ) is  upper  upper (Subset of R)
and
A3: R tolerates S
and
A4: x = a
and
A5: y = b;
(a in ( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) ) & b in ( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) )) by A4,A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then reconsider xy = ( a "\/" b ) as (Element of R) by A1,CKB17:1,CKB20:1;
( a "\/" b ) >= b by YELLOW_0:22;
then A6: xy >= y by A3,A5,CKB19:1;
A7: (for d being (Element of R) holds ((d >= x & d >= y) implies xy <= d))
proof
let d being (Element of R);
reconsider X = x,D = d as (Element of ( R [*] S )) by CKB14:1;
assume that
A8: d >= x
and
A9: d >= y;
X <= D by A3,A8,CKB12:1;
then reconsider dd = d as (Element of S) by A2,A4,CKB22:1;
(dd >= a & b <= dd) by A3,A4,A5,A8,A9,CKB19:1;
then ( a "\/" b ) <= dd by YELLOW_5:9;
hence thesis by A3,CKB19:1;
end;
( a "\/" b ) >= a by YELLOW_0:22;
then xy >= x by A3,A4,CKB19:1;
hence thesis by A6,A7,YELLOW_0:22;
end;
