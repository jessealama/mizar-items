theorem
(for x,y being set holds (for R,S being RelStr holds (([ x,y ] in (the InternalRel of ( R [*] S )) & ( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) ) is  upper  upper (Subset of R)) implies (((x in (the carrier of R) & y in (the carrier of R)) or (x in (the carrier of S) & y in (the carrier of S))) or (x in ( (the carrier of R) \ (the carrier of S) ) & y in ( (the carrier of S) \ (the carrier of R) ))))))
proof
let x being set;
let y being set;
let R being RelStr;
let S being RelStr;
assume that
A1: [ x,y ] in (the InternalRel of ( R [*] S ))
and
A2: ( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) ) is  upper  upper (Subset of R);
x in (the carrier of ( R [*] S )) by A1,ZFMISC_1:87;
then A3: x in ( (the carrier of R) \/ (the carrier of S) ) by CKB3:def 1;
y in (the carrier of ( R [*] S )) by A1,ZFMISC_1:87;
then A4: y in ( (the carrier of R) \/ (the carrier of S) ) by CKB3:def 1;
per cases  by A3,A4,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose (x in (the carrier of R) & y in (the carrier of R));

hence thesis;
