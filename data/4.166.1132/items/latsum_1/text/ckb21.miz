theorem
Th17: (for R,S being RelStr holds (for a,b being set holds (((( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) ) is  upper  upper (Subset of R) & [ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of ( R [*] S ))) & a in (the carrier of S)) implies b in (the carrier of S))))
proof
let R being RelStr,S being RelStr;
let a being set,b being set;
set X = ( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) );
reconsider X as (Subset of R) by XBOOLE_1:17;
assume that
A1: ( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) ) is  upper  upper (Subset of R)
and
A2: [ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of ( R [*] S ))
and
A3: a in (the carrier of S);
[ a,b ] in ( ( (the InternalRel of R) \/ (the InternalRel of S) ) \/ ( (the InternalRel of R) * (the InternalRel of S) ) ) by A2,CKB3:def 1;
then A4: ([ a,b ] in ( (the InternalRel of R) \/ (the InternalRel of S) ) or [ a,b ] in ( (the InternalRel of R) * (the InternalRel of S) )) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
assume A5: (not b in (the carrier of S));
per cases  by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A6: [ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of R);

then reconsider a9 = a,b9 = b as (Element of R) by ZFMISC_1:87;
a in (the carrier of R) by A6,ZFMISC_1:87;
then A7: a in ( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) ) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
a9 <= b9 by A6,ORDERS_2:def 5;
then (X c= (the carrier of S) & b in X) by A1,A7,WAYBEL_0:def 20,XBOOLE_1:17;
hence thesis by A5;
end;
suppose [ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of S);

hence thesis by A5,ZFMISC_1:87;
end;
suppose [ a,b ] in ( (the InternalRel of R) * (the InternalRel of S) );

hence thesis by A5,ZFMISC_1:87;
end;
