theorem
Th2: (for R,S being RelStr holds ((the InternalRel of R) c= (the InternalRel of ( R [*] S )) & (the InternalRel of S) c= (the InternalRel of ( R [*] S ))))
proof
let R being RelStr;
let S being RelStr;
((the InternalRel of R) c= ( (the InternalRel of R) \/ (the InternalRel of S) ) & ( (the InternalRel of R) \/ (the InternalRel of S) ) c= ( ( (the InternalRel of R) \/ (the InternalRel of S) ) \/ ( (the InternalRel of R) * (the InternalRel of S) ) )) by XBOOLE_1:7;
then (the InternalRel of R) c= ( ( (the InternalRel of R) \/ (the InternalRel of S) ) \/ ( (the InternalRel of R) * (the InternalRel of S) ) ) by XBOOLE_1:1;
hence (the InternalRel of R) c= (the InternalRel of ( R [*] S )) by CKB3:def 1;
((the InternalRel of S) c= ( (the InternalRel of R) \/ (the InternalRel of S) ) & ( (the InternalRel of R) \/ (the InternalRel of S) ) c= ( ( (the InternalRel of R) \/ (the InternalRel of S) ) \/ ( (the InternalRel of R) * (the InternalRel of S) ) )) by XBOOLE_1:7;
then (the InternalRel of S) c= ( ( (the InternalRel of R) \/ (the InternalRel of S) ) \/ ( (the InternalRel of R) * (the InternalRel of S) ) ) by XBOOLE_1:1;
hence thesis by CKB3:def 1;
