theorem
(for R,S being RelStr holds (((((R tolerates S & ( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) ) is  upper  upper (Subset of R)) & ( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) ) is  lower  lower (Subset of S)) & R is  transitive  antisymmetric) & S is  transitive  antisymmetric) implies ( R [*] S ) is  antisymmetric))
proof
let R being RelStr,S being RelStr;
set X = (the carrier of ( R [*] S ));
set F = (the InternalRel of ( R [*] S ));
assume that
A1: R tolerates S
and
A2: ( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) ) is  upper  upper (Subset of R)
and
A3: ( (the carrier of R) /\ (the carrier of S) ) is  lower  lower (Subset of S)
and
A4: R is  transitive  antisymmetric
and
A5: S is  transitive  antisymmetric;
A6: (the InternalRel of S) is_antisymmetric_in (the carrier of S) by A5,ORDERS_2:def 4;
A7: (the InternalRel of R) is_antisymmetric_in (the carrier of R) by A4,ORDERS_2:def 4;
F is_antisymmetric_in X
proof
let x being set,y being set;
assume that
A8: (x in X & y in X)
and
A9: [ x,y ] in F
and
A10: [ y,x ] in F;
A11: (x in ( (the carrier of R) \/ (the carrier of S) ) & y in ( (the carrier of R) \/ (the carrier of S) )) by A8,CKB3:def 1;
per cases  by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A12: (x in (the carrier of R) & y in (the carrier of R));

then ([ x,y ] in (the InternalRel of R) & [ y,x ] in (the InternalRel of R)) by A1,A4,A9,A10,CKB8:1;
hence thesis by A7,A12,RELAT_2:def 4;
end;
suppose A13: (x in (the carrier of R) & y in (the carrier of S));

then A14: y in (the carrier of R) by A3,A10,CKB25:1;
then ([ x,y ] in (the InternalRel of R) & [ y,x ] in (the InternalRel of R)) by A1,A4,A9,A10,A13,CKB8:1;
hence thesis by A7,A13,A14,RELAT_2:def 4;
end;
suppose A15: (x in (the carrier of S) & y in (the carrier of R));

then A16: y in (the carrier of S) by A2,A9,CKB21:1;
then ([ x,y ] in (the InternalRel of S) & [ y,x ] in (the InternalRel of S)) by A1,A5,A9,A10,A15,CKB9:1;
hence thesis by A6,A15,A16,RELAT_2:def 4;
end;
suppose A17: (x in (the carrier of S) & y in (the carrier of S));

then ([ x,y ] in (the InternalRel of S) & [ y,x ] in (the InternalRel of S)) by A1,A5,A9,A10,CKB9:1;
hence thesis by A6,A17,RELAT_2:def 4;
end;
end;
hence thesis by ORDERS_2:def 4;
