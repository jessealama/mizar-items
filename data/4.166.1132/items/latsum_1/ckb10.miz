theorem
Th6: (for R,S being RelStr holds (for a,b being set holds (([ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of R) implies [ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of ( R [*] S ))) & ([ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of S) implies [ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of ( R [*] S ))))))
proof
let R being RelStr,S being RelStr;
let a being set,b being set;
thus ([ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of R) implies [ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of ( R [*] S )))
proof
assume [ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of R);
then [ a,b ] in ( (the InternalRel of R) \/ (the InternalRel of S) ) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then [ a,b ] in ( ( (the InternalRel of R) \/ (the InternalRel of S) ) \/ ( (the InternalRel of R) * (the InternalRel of S) ) ) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence thesis by CKB3:def 1;
end;
