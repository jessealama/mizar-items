begin
reserve A for non empty set;
definition
let A;
func ComplexFuncExtMult A -> (Function of [: ( COMPLEX ),( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) ) :],( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) ))
means
:Def3: (for z being Complex holds (for f being (Element of ( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) )) holds (for x being (Element of A) holds ( ( it . [ z,f ] ) . x ) = ( z * ( f . x ) ))));
existence
proof
deffunc F((Element of ( COMPLEX )),(Element of ( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) ))) = ( ( multcomplex ) [;] ($1,$2) );
consider F being (Function of [: ( COMPLEX ),( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) ) :],( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) )) such that A1: (for z being (Element of ( COMPLEX )) holds (for f being (Element of ( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) )) holds ( F . (z,f) ) = F(z,f))) from BINOP_1:sch 4;
take F;
let z being Complex;
let f being (Element of ( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) ));
let x being (Element of A);
( F . (z,f) ) = ( ( multcomplex ) [;] (z,f) ) by A1;
hence ( ( F . [ z,f ] ) . x ) = ( ( multcomplex ) . (z,( f . x )) ) by FUNCOP_1:53
.= ( z * ( f . x ) ) by BINOP_2:def 5;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let it1 being (Function of [: ( COMPLEX ),( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) ) :],( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) )),it2 being (Function of [: ( COMPLEX ),( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) ) :],( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) ));
assume that
A2: (for z being (Element of ( COMPLEX )) holds (for f being (Element of ( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) )) holds (for x being (Element of A) holds ( ( it1 . [ z,f ] ) . x ) = ( z * ( f . x ) ))))
and
A3: (for z being (Element of ( COMPLEX )) holds (for f being (Element of ( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) )) holds (for x being (Element of A) holds ( ( it2 . [ z,f ] ) . x ) = ( z * ( f . x ) ))));
now
let z being (Element of ( COMPLEX ));
let f being (Element of ( Funcs (A,( COMPLEX )) ));
now
let x being (Element of A);
thus ( ( it1 . [ z,f ] ) . x ) = ( z * ( f . x ) ) by A2
.= ( ( it2 . [ z,f ] ) . x ) by A3;
end;
hence ( it1 . (z,f) ) = ( it2 . (z,f) ) by FUNCT_2:63;
end;
hence thesis by BINOP_1:2;
end;
