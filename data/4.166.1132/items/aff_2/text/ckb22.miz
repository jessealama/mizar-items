theorem
(AP is  satisfying_pap iff AP is  satisfying_pap_1)
proof
hereby
assume A1: AP is  satisfying_pap;
thus AP is  satisfying_pap_1
proof
let M;
let N;
let a;
let b;
let c;
let a9;
let b9;
let c9;
assume that
A2: M is  being_line
and
A3: N is  being_line
and
A4: a in M
and
A5: b in M
and
A6: c in M
and
A7: M // N
and
A8: M <> N
and
A9: a9 in N
and
A10: b9 in N
and
A11: a,b9 // b,a9
and
A12: b,c9 // c,b9
and
A13: a,c9 // c,a9
and
A14: a9 <> b9;
A15: c <> a9 by A6,A7,A8,A9,AFF_1:45;
set C = ( Line (c,b9) );
A16: c <> b9 by A6,A7,A8,A10,AFF_1:45;
then C is  being_line by AFF_1:24;
then consider K such that A17: b in K and A18: C // K by AFF_1:49;
A19: (c in C & b9 in C) by A16,AFF_1:24;
A20: (not K // N)
proof
assume K // N;
then C // N by A18,AFF_1:44;
then C // M by A7,AFF_1:44;
then b9 in M by A6,A19,AFF_1:45;
hence contradiction by A7,A8,A10,AFF_1:45;
end;
K is  being_line by A18,AFF_1:36;

then a,x // a,c9 by A13,A15,AFF_1:5;
then  LIN a,x,c9 by AFF_1:def 1;
then A24:  LIN c9,x,a by AFF_1:6;
A25: a <> b
proof
assume a = b;
then  LIN a,b9,a9 by A11,AFF_1:def 1;
then  LIN a9,b9,a by AFF_1:6;
then (a9 = b9 or a in N) by A3,A9,A10,AFF_1:25;
hence contradiction by A4,A7,A8,A14,AFF_1:45;
end;
A26: c9 <> b
proof
assume c9 = b;
then a9 in M by A2,A4,A5,A6,A13,A25,AFF_1:48;
hence contradiction by A7,A8,A9,AFF_1:45;
end;
b,x // b,c9 by A12,A16,A23,AFF_1:5;
then  LIN b,x,c9 by AFF_1:def 1;
then A27:  LIN c9,x,b by AFF_1:6;
assume A28: (not c9 in N);
 LIN c9,x,c9 by AFF_1:7;
then c9 in M by A2,A4,A5,A28,A25,A22,A24,A27,AFF_1:8,AFF_1:25;
then b9 in M by A2,A5,A6,A12,A26,AFF_1:48;

proof

then  LIN a9,a,b by AFF_1:def 1;
then  LIN a,b,a9 by AFF_1:6;

hence contradiction by A35,A36,A40,A43,A51,AFF_1:45;
end;
A52: (not D // P)
proof
