theorem
(AP is  satisfying_TDES_3 implies AP is  Moufangian)
proof
assume A1: AP is  satisfying_TDES_3;
let K;
let o;
let a;
let b;
let c;
let a9;
let b9;
let c9;
assume that
A2: K is  being_line
and

and
A4: c in K
and
A5: c9 in K
and
A6: (not a in K)
and
A7: o <> c
and
A8: a <> b
and
A9:  LIN o,a,a9
and
A10:  LIN o,b,b9
and
A11: a,b // a9,b9
and

A26: A <> P
proof
assume A = P;
then a,b // A by A21,A20,A25,AFF_1:40,AFF_1:41;

A38: N is  being_line by A37,AFF_1:36;
A39: (not  LIN a,b,c)
proof
assume  LIN a,b,c;
then a,b // a,c by AFF_1:def 1;
then a,c // K by A8,A13,AFF_1:32;
then c,a // K by AFF_1:34;
hence contradiction by A2,A4,A6,AFF_1:23;
end;
(not a9,c9 // N)
proof
assume A40: a9,c9 // N;

then a,c // N by A32,A40,AFF_1:32;
then a,c // M by A37,AFF_1:43;
then c,a // M by AFF_1:34;
