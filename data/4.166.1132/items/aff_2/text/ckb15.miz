theorem
(AP is  Pappian iff AP is  satisfying_PAP_1)
proof
hereby
assume A1: AP is  Pappian;
thus AP is  satisfying_PAP_1
proof
let M;
let N;
let o;
let a;
let b;
let c;
let a9;
let b9;
let c9;
assume that
A2: M is  being_line
and
A3: N is  being_line
and
A4: M <> N
and
A5: o in M
and
A6: o in N
and
A7: o <> a
and
o <> a9
and
A8: o <> b
and
A9: o <> b9
and
A10: o <> c
and
A11: o <> c9
and
A12: a in M
and
A13: b in M
and
A14: c in M
and
A15: b9 in N
and
A16: c9 in N
and
A17: a,b9 // b,a9
and
A18: b,c9 // c,b9
and
A19: a,c9 // c,a9
and
A20: b <> c;
A21: a <> c9 by A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A7,A12,A16,AFF_1:18;
A22: b <> a9
proof
assume b = a9;
then c,b // a,c9 by A19,AFF_1:4;
then c9 in M by A2,A12,A13,A14,A20,AFF_1:48;
hence contradiction by A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A11,A16,AFF_1:18;
end;
(not b,a9 // N)
proof
assume A23: b,a9 // N;

A26: b,a9 // b,x by A25,AFF_1:def 1;
A27: o <> x
proof
assume o = x;
then b,o // a,b9 by A17,A22,A26,AFF_1:5;
then b9 in M by A2,A5,A8,A12,A13,AFF_1:48;
hence contradiction by A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A9,A15,AFF_1:18;

then c,a9 // c,x by A19,A21,AFF_1:5;
then  LIN c,a9,x by AFF_1:def 1;
then A28:  LIN a9,x,c by AFF_1:6;
A29:  LIN a9,x,x by AFF_1:7;
assume A30: (not a9 in N);

then x in M by A2,A13,A14,A20,A30,A24,A28,A29,AFF_1:8,AFF_1:25;
hence contradiction by A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A24,A27,AFF_1:18;

A56: b <> c
proof
