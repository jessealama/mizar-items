theorem
Th5: ((((((A is  being_line & M is  being_line) & a in A) & b in A) & a in M) & b in M) implies (a = b or A = M))
proof
assume that
A1: A is  being_line
and
A2: M is  being_line
and
A3: a in A
and
A4: b in A
and
A5: a in M
and
A6: b in M;
reconsider A9 = A,M9 = M as (Subset of ( Af X )) by ANALMETR:42;
A7: M9 is  being_line by A2,ANALMETR:43;
assume A8: a <> b;
A9 is  being_line by A1,ANALMETR:43;
hence thesis by A3,A4,A5,A6,A8,A7,AFF_1:18;
