reserve X for OrtAfPl;

theorem
Th3: (for A holds (for a holds (A is  being_line implies (ex K st (a in K & A _|_ K)))))
proof
let A;
let a;
assume A is  being_line;
then consider b,c such that A1: b <> c and A2: A = ( Line (b,c) ) by ANALMETR:def 12;
consider d such that A3: b,c _|_ a,d and A4: a <> d by ANALMETR:39;
reconsider a9 = a,d9 = d as (Element of ( Af X )) by ANALMETR:35;
take K = ( Line (a,d) );
K = ( Line (a9,d9) ) by ANALMETR:41;
hence a in K by AFF_1:15;
thus thesis by A1,A2,A3,A4,ANALMETR:45;
