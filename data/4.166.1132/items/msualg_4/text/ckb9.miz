proof
deffunc F((Element of S)) = ( id ( (the Sorts of U1) . $1 ) );
consider f being Function such that A1: (( dom f ) = (the carrier of S) & (for d being (Element of S) holds ( f . d ) = F(d))) from FUNCT_1:sch 4;
reconsider f as (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of S)) by A1,PARTFUN1:def 2,RELAT_1:def 18;
(for x being set holds (x in ( dom f ) implies ( f . x ) is Relation))
proof
let x being set;

proof
