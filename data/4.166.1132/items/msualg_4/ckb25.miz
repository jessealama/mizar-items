theorem
Th2: (for A being  non-empty MSAlgebra over S holds (for R being (MSCongruence of A) holds (for x being set holds (x in ( ( ( ( Class R ) # ) * (the Arity of S) ) . o ) implies (ex a being (Element of ( Args (o,A) )) st x = ( R # a ))))))
proof
let A being  non-empty MSAlgebra over S;
let R being (MSCongruence of A);
let x being set;
assume A1: x in ( ( ( ( Class R ) # ) * (the Arity of S) ) . o );
set ar = ( the_arity_of o );
A2: ar = ( (the Arity of S) . o ) by MSUALG_1:def 1;
then ( ( ( ( Class R ) # ) * (the Arity of S) ) . o ) = ( product ( ( Class R ) * ar ) ) by MSAFREE:1;
then consider f being Function such that A3: f = x and A4: ( dom f ) = ( dom ( ( Class R ) * ar ) ) and A5: (for y being set holds (y in ( dom ( ( Class R ) * ar ) ) implies ( f . y ) in ( ( ( Class R ) * ar ) . y ))) by A1,CARD_3:def 5;

A7: (for n being Nat holds (n in ( dom f ) implies ( f . n ) in ( Class ( R . ( ar /. n ) ) )))
proof
let n being Nat;
reconsider s = ( ar /. n ) as (Element of S);
assume A8: n in ( dom f );
then ( ar . n ) = ( ar /. n ) by A4,A6,PARTFUN1:def 6;

proof
let a being set;
