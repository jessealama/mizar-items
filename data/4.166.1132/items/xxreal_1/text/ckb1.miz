proof
set A = { a: P[ a ] };
set B = { a: Q[ a ] };
reconsider X = ( A /\ ( REAL ) ),Y = ( B /\ ( REAL ) ) as (Subset of ( REAL )) by XBOOLE_1:17;
per cases ;

per cases ;
suppose A3: ( +infty ) in A;

take ( +infty );
thus (for r holds (P[ r ] implies r <= ( +infty ))) by XXREAL_0:3;
(ex a st (a = ( +infty ) & P[ a ])) by A3;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
suppose A4: (not ( +infty ) in A);

take ( -infty );
thus (for r holds (P[ r ] implies r <= ( -infty )))
proof
let r;
assume that

then A6: r in A by A5;
per cases  by A4,A6,XXREAL_0:14;
suppose r = ( -infty );

hence thesis;

suppose r in ( REAL );

hence thesis by A2,A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;

per cases ;
suppose A8: ( -infty ) in B;

take ( -infty );
(ex a st (a = ( -infty ) & Q[ a ])) by A8;

(for x,y being  real number holds ((x in X & y in Y) implies x <= y))
proof
let x being  real number,y being  real number;

assume y in Y;
then y in B by XBOOLE_0:def 4;

then consider s being  real number such that A15: (for x,y being  real number holds ((x in X & y in Y) implies (x <= s & s <= y))) by AXIOMS:1;
reconsider s as  ext-real number;
take s;

assume A18: P[ r ];
per cases  by A1,A17,A18,XXREAL_0:13;
suppose A19: r in ( REAL );

then reconsider r as  real number;
r is (Element of ( ExtREAL )) by XXREAL_0:def 1;
then r in A by A18;
then r in X by A19,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by A15,A16;
end;
suppose r = ( -infty );

hence thesis by XXREAL_0:5;

assume A22: Q[ r ];
per cases  by A1,A21,A22,XXREAL_0:10;
suppose A23: r in ( REAL );

then reconsider r as  real number;
r is (Element of ( ExtREAL )) by XXREAL_0:def 1;
