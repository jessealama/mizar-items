theorem
Th60: (for S being (SigmaField of X) holds (for M being (sigma_Measure of S) holds M is (Measure of S)))
proof
let S being (SigmaField of X);
let M being (sigma_Measure of S);
(for A,B being (Element of S) holds (A misses B implies ( M . ( A \/ B ) ) = ( ( M . A ) + ( M . B ) )))
proof
set n2 = ( 1 + 1 );
let A being (Element of S);
let B being (Element of S);
assume A1: A misses B;
A2: (A in S & B in S);
reconsider A,B as (Subset of X);
( {} ) is (Subset of X) by XBOOLE_1:2;
then consider F being (Function of ( NAT ),( bool X )) such that A3: ( rng F ) = { A,B,( {} ) } and A4: (( F . ( 0 ) ) = A & ( F . 1 ) = B) and A5: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (1 < n implies ( F . n ) = ( {} ))) by CKB35:1;

then (for x being set holds (x in { A,B,( {} ) } implies x in S)) by A2,ENUMSET1:def 1;
then { A,B,( {} ) } c= S by TARSKI:def 3;
then reconsider F as (Function of ( NAT ),S) by A3,FUNCT_2:6;

A8: ((m = ( 0 ) or m = 1) or 1 < m) by NAT_1:25;
A9: ((1 < n & m = 1) implies ( F . n ) misses ( F . m ))
proof
assume that
A10: 1 < n
and
m = 1;
( F . n ) = ( {} ) by A5,A10;
then ( ( F . n ) /\ ( F . m ) ) = ( {} );
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
end;

proof
assume that
A12: 1 < n
and
m = ( 0 );
( F . n ) = ( {} ) by A5,A12;
then ( ( F . n ) /\ ( F . m ) ) = ( {} );

proof

then ( ( F . n ) /\ ( F . m ) ) = ( {} );

proof
assume that
n = ( 0 )
and
A18: 1 < m;
( F . m ) = ( {} ) by A5,A18;
then ( ( F . n ) /\ ( F . m ) ) = ( {} );

(for m,n being set holds (m <> n implies ( F . m ) misses ( F . n )))
proof
let m being set;
let n being set;
assume A19: m <> n;
per cases ;
suppose (m in ( NAT ) & n in ( NAT ));

hence thesis by A6,A19;
end;
suppose ((not m in ( NAT )) or (not n in ( NAT )));

then ((not m in ( dom F )) or (not n in ( dom F )));

proof
let r being (Element of ( NAT ));
A22: (for r being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( ( M * F ) . r ) = ( M . ( F . r ) ))
proof
let r being (Element of ( NAT ));
( dom ( M * F ) ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence thesis by FUNCT_1:12;
end;
(( 1 + 1 ) <= r implies ( ( M * F ) . r ) = ( 0. ))
proof
assume ( 1 + 1 ) <= r;
then 1 < r by NAT_1:13;
then ( F . r ) = ( {} ) by A5;
