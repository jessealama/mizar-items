theorem
((((the carrier of M) = (the carrier of N) & (for m being (Point of M) holds (for n being (Point of N) holds (for r being Real holds ((r > ( 0 ) & m = n) implies (ex r1 being Real st (r1 > ( 0 ) & ( Ball (n,r1) ) c= ( Ball (m,r) )))))))) & (for m being (Point of M) holds (for n being (Point of N) holds (for r being Real holds ((r > ( 0 ) & m = n) implies (ex r1 being Real st (r1 > ( 0 ) & ( Ball (m,r1) ) c= ( Ball (n,r) )))))))) implies ( TopSpaceMetr M ) = ( TopSpaceMetr N ))
proof
assume that
A1: (the carrier of M) = (the carrier of N)
and
A2: (for m being (Point of M) holds (for n being (Point of N) holds (for r being Real holds ((r > ( 0 ) & m = n) implies (ex r1 being Real st (r1 > ( 0 ) & ( Ball (n,r1) ) c= ( Ball (m,r) )))))))
and
A3: (for m being (Point of M) holds (for n being (Point of N) holds (for r being Real holds ((r > ( 0 ) & m = n) implies (ex r1 being Real st (r1 > ( 0 ) & ( Ball (m,r1) ) c= ( Ball (n,r) )))))));
A4: ( Family_open_set M ) = ( Family_open_set N )
proof
thus ( Family_open_set M ) c= ( Family_open_set N )
proof
let X being set;
assume A5: X in ( Family_open_set M );
(for n being (Point of N) holds (n in X implies (ex r being Real st (r > ( 0 ) & ( Ball (n,r) ) c= X))))
proof
let n being (Point of N);
assume that
A6: n in X;
reconsider m = n as (Point of M) by A1;
consider r being Real such that A7: r > ( 0 ) and A8: ( Ball (m,r) ) c= X by A5,A6,PCOMPS_1:def 4;
consider r1 being Real such that A9: (r1 > ( 0 ) & ( Ball (n,r1) ) c= ( Ball (m,r) )) by A2,A7;
take r1;
thus thesis by A8,A9,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
hence thesis by A1,A5,PCOMPS_1:def 4;

let X being set;
assume A10: X in ( Family_open_set N );
(for m being (Point of M) holds (m in X implies (ex r being Real st (r > ( 0 ) & ( Ball (m,r) ) c= X))))
proof
let m being (Point of M);
assume that
A11: m in X;
reconsider n = m as (Point of N) by A1;
consider r being Real such that A12: r > ( 0 ) and A13: ( Ball (n,r) ) c= X by A10,A11,PCOMPS_1:def 4;
consider r1 being Real such that A14: (r1 > ( 0 ) & ( Ball (m,r1) ) c= ( Ball (n,r) )) by A3,A12;
take r1;
thus thesis by A13,A14,XBOOLE_1:1;

( TopSpaceMetr M ) = TopStruct (# (the carrier of M),( Family_open_set M ) #) by PCOMPS_1:def 5;
hence thesis by A1,A4,PCOMPS_1:def 5;
