uniqueness
proof

set f = (the distance of A);
set g = (the distance of B);
(for a,b being set holds ((a in (the carrier of A) & b in (the carrier of A)) implies ( f . (a,b) ) = ( g . (a,b) )))
proof
let a being set,b being set;
assume A8: (a in (the carrier of A) & b in (the carrier of A));
then consider x1 being (Point of M),y1 being (Point of M),x2 being (Point of N),y2 being (Point of N) such that A9: a = [ x1,x2 ] and A10: b = [ y1,y2 ] and A11: ( f . (a,b) ) = ( max (( (the distance of M) . (x1,y1) ),( (the distance of N) . (x2,y2) )) ) by A5;
