theorem
(X = ( Y "\/" Z ) iff ((Y [= X & Z [= X) & (for V holds ((Y [= V & Z [= V) implies X [= V))))
proof
thus (X = ( Y "\/" Z ) implies ((Y [= X & Z [= X) & (for V holds ((Y [= V & Z [= V) implies X [= V)))) by FILTER_0:6,LATTICES:5;
assume that
A1: (Y [= X & Z [= X)
and
A2: (for V holds ((Y [= V & Z [= V) implies X [= V));
A3: ( Y "\/" Z ) [= X by A1,FILTER_0:6;
(Y [= ( Y "\/" Z ) & Z [= ( Y "\/" Z )) by LATTICES:5;
then X [= ( Y "\/" Z ) by A2;
hence thesis by A3,LATTICES:8;
