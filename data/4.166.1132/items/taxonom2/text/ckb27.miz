theorem
(for H being  covering (Hierarchy of Y) holds (H is  with_max's implies (ex P being (a_partition of Y) st P c= H)))
proof
let H being  covering (Hierarchy of Y);
assume that
A1: H is  with_max's;
per cases ;
suppose A2: Y = ( {} );

set P9 = ( {} );
reconsider P = P9 as (Subset-Family of Y) by XBOOLE_1:2;
take P;
thus thesis by A2,EQREL_1:45,XBOOLE_1:2;
end;
suppose A3: Y <> ( {} );

now
per cases ;
suppose A4: Y in H;

set P = { Y };
A5: P c= H
proof
let p being set;
assume p in P;
hence thesis by A4,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
P is (a_partition of Y) by A3,EQREL_1:39;
hence thesis by A5;
end;
suppose A6: (not Y in H);

 means
(ex S being (Subset of Y) st ((S in H & S c= $1) & (for V being (Subset of Y) holds (($1 c= V & V in H) implies V = Y))));
consider P9 being set such that A7: (for T being set holds (T in P9 iff (T in H & X[ T ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
A8: P9 c= H
proof
let p being set;
assume p in P9;
hence thesis by A7;
end;
then reconsider P = P9 as (Subset-Family of Y) by XBOOLE_1:1;
A9:now
let S1;
assume that
A10: S1 in P;
thus S1 <> ( {} )
proof
consider S being (Subset of Y) such that A11: S in H and A12: S c= S1 and A13: (for V being (Subset of Y) holds ((S1 c= V & V in H) implies V = Y)) by A7,A10;
assume A14: S1 = ( {} );
then S1 = S by A12
.= Y by A14,A11,A13,XBOOLE_1:2;
hence contradiction by A3,A14;
end;

thus (for S2 holds (S2 in P implies (S1 = S2 or S1 misses S2)))
proof
let S2;
assume that
A15: S2 in P;
A16: (ex T being (Subset of Y) st ((T in H & T c= S2) & (for V being (Subset of Y) holds ((S2 c= V & V in H) implies V = Y)))) by A7,A15;
S2 in H by A7,A15;
hence thesis by A6,A16;
end;

end;
A17: ( union H ) = Y by ABIAN:4;
Y c= ( union P )
proof
let p being set;
assume p in Y;
then consider h9 being set such that A18: p in h9 and A19: h9 in H by A17,TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider h = h9 as (Subset of Y) by A19;
consider T being (Subset of Y) such that A20: h c= T and A21: T in H and A22: (for V being (Subset of Y) holds ((T c= V & V in H) implies V = Y)) by A1,A19,CKB26:def 1;
T in P by A7,A21,A22;
hence thesis by A18,A20,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
then ( union P ) = Y by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then P is (a_partition of Y) by A9,EQREL_1:def 4;
hence thesis by A8;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
