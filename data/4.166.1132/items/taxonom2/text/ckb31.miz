theorem
Th17: (for H being  covering  T_3 (Hierarchy of Y) holds ((H is  lower-bounded & (not ( {} ) in H)) implies (for A being (Subset of Y) holds (A in H implies (ex P being (a_partition of Y) st (A in P & P c= H))))))
proof
let H being  covering  T_3 (Hierarchy of Y);
assume that
A1: H is  lower-bounded
and
A2: (not ( {} ) in H);
let A being (Subset of Y);
assume that
A3: A in H;
set k1 = { A };
A4: k1 c= H by A3,ZFMISC_1:31;
A5: A in k1 by TARSKI:def 1;
A6: k1 c= ( bool Y ) by ZFMISC_1:31;
defpred X[ set ]
 means
((A in $1 & $1 is  mutually-disjoint) & $1 c= H);
consider K being set such that A7: (for S being set holds (S in K iff (S in ( bool ( bool Y ) ) & X[ S ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
k1 is  mutually-disjoint by CKB20:1;
then A8: k1 in K by A7,A5,A4,A6;
(for Z being set holds ((Z c= K & Z is  c=-linear) implies (ex X3 being set st (X3 in K & (for X1 being set holds (X1 in Z implies X1 c= X3))))))
proof
let Z being set;
assume that
A9: Z c= K
and
A10: Z is  c=-linear;
A11:now
let X1 being set;
let X2 being set;
assume that
A12: X1 in Z
and
A13: X2 in Z;
X1,X2 are_c=-comparable  by A10,A12,A13,ORDINAL1:def 8;
hence (X1 c= X2 or X2 c= X1) by XBOOLE_0:def 9;
end;
per cases ;
suppose A14: Z <> ( {} );

set X3 = ( union Z );
take X3;
now
consider z being set such that A15: z in Z by A14,XBOOLE_0:def 1;
A in z by A7,A9,A15;
hence A in X3 by A15,TARSKI:def 4;
A16: (for a holds (a in Z implies a c= H)) by A7,A9;
then X3 c= H by ZFMISC_1:76;
then X3 c= ( bool Y ) by XBOOLE_1:1;
hence X3 in ( bool ( bool Y ) );
thus X3 is  mutually-disjoint
proof
let t1 being set;
let t2 being set;
assume that
A17: t1 in X3
and
A18: t2 in X3
and
A19: t1 <> t2;
consider v1 being set such that A20: t1 in v1 and A21: v1 in Z by A17,TARSKI:def 4;
A22: v1 is  mutually-disjoint by A7,A9,A21;
consider v2 being set such that A23: t2 in v2 and A24: v2 in Z by A18,TARSKI:def 4;
A25: v2 is  mutually-disjoint by A7,A9,A24;
per cases  by A11,A21,A24;
suppose v1 c= v2;

hence thesis by A19,A20,A23,A25,CKB16:def 1;
end;
suppose v2 c= v1;

hence thesis by A19,A20,A23,A22,CKB16:def 1;
end;
end;

thus X3 c= H by A16,ZFMISC_1:76;
end;
hence X3 in K by A7;
thus thesis by ZFMISC_1:74;
end;
suppose A26: Z = ( {} );

consider a being set such that A27: a in K by A8;
take a;
thus a in K by A27;
thus thesis by A26;
end;
end;
then consider M being set such that A28: M in K and A29: (for Z being set holds ((Z in K & Z <> M) implies (not M c= Z))) by A8,ORDERS_1:65;
A30: M is  mutually-disjoint  mutually-disjoint (Subset-Family of Y) by A7,A28;
A31:now
let C being  mutually-disjoint (Subset-Family of Y);
assume that
A32: A in C
and
A33: C c= H
and
A34: M c= C;
C in K by A7,A32,A33;
hence M = C by A29,A34;
end;
A35: A in M by A7,A28;
take M;
M c= H by A7,A28;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A30,A35,A31,CKB30:1;
end;
