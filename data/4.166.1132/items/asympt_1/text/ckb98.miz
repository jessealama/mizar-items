(for g being Real_Sequence holds ((for n holds ((n in ( POWEROF2SET ) implies ( g . n ) = n) & ((not n in ( POWEROF2SET )) implies ( g . n ) = ( n to_power 2 )))) implies (ex s being  eventually-positive Real_Sequence st (((((s = g & ( seq_n^ 1 ) in ( Big_Theta (s,( POWEROF2SET )) )) & (not ( seq_n^ 1 ) in ( Big_Theta s ))) & ( s taken_every 2 ) in ( Big_Oh s )) & ( seq_n^ 1 ) is  eventually-nondecreasing) & (not s is  eventually-nondecreasing)))))
proof
let g being Real_Sequence;
assume that

A2: g is  eventually-positive
proof
take 1;
let n;
assume A3: n >= 1;
thus ( g . n ) > ( 0 )
proof
per cases ;
suppose n in ( POWEROF2SET );

hence thesis by A1,A3;
end;
suppose (not n in ( POWEROF2SET ));

then ( g . n ) = ( n to_power 2 ) by A1;

A5:now
let n;
assume n >= ( 0 );
A6: ( h . n ) = ( g . ( 2 * n ) ) by ASYMPT_0:def 15;
thus ( h . n ) <= ( 4 * ( g . n ) )
proof
per cases ;
suppose A7: n in ( POWEROF2SET );

then consider m such that A8: n = ( 2 to_power m );
( 2 * n ) = ( ( 2 to_power 1 ) * ( 2 to_power m ) ) by A8,POWER:25

now
assume ( 2 * n ) in ( POWEROF2SET );

thus contradiction
proof
per cases ;
suppose A12: m = ( 0 );

A13:now
