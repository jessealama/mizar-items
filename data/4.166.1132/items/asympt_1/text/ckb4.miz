theorem
(for a,b being  logbase Real holds (for f,g being Real_Sequence holds ((((a > 1 & b > 1) & (for n holds (n > ( 0 ) implies ( f . n ) = ( log (a,n) )))) & (for n holds (n > ( 0 ) implies ( g . n ) = ( log (b,n) )))) implies (ex s,s1 being  eventually-positive Real_Sequence st ((s = f & s1 = g) & ( Big_Oh s ) = ( Big_Oh s1 ))))))
proof
let a being  logbase Real;
let b being  logbase Real;
let f being Real_Sequence;
let g being Real_Sequence;
assume that
A1: a > 1
and
A2: b > 1
and
A3: (for n holds (n > ( 0 ) implies ( f . n ) = ( log (a,n) )))
and
A4: (for n holds (n > ( 0 ) implies ( g . n ) = ( log (b,n) )));
reconsider g as  eventually-positive Real_Sequence by A2,A4,CKB3:1;
reconsider f as  eventually-positive Real_Sequence by A1,A3,CKB3:1;
take f;
take g;
A5: a <> 1 by ASYMPT_0:def 1;
A6: b <> 1 by ASYMPT_0:def 1;
A7: b > ( 0 ) by ASYMPT_0:def 1;
A8: a > ( 0 ) by ASYMPT_0:def 1;
now
let x being set;
hereby
assume x in ( Big_Oh f );
then consider t being (Element of ( Funcs (( NAT ),( REAL )) )) such that A9: x = t and A10: (ex c st (ex N st (c > ( 0 ) & (for n holds (n >= N implies (( t . n ) <= ( c * ( f . n ) ) & ( t . n ) >= ( 0 )))))));
consider c,N such that A11: c > ( 0 ) and A12: (for n holds (n >= N implies (( t . n ) <= ( c * ( f . n ) ) & ( t . n ) >= ( 0 )))) by A10;
A13:now
take N1 = ( N + 1 );
let n;
assume A14: n >= N1;
then A15: ( f . n ) = ( log (a,n) ) by A3
.= ( ( log (a,b) ) * ( log (b,n) ) ) by A8,A5,A7,A6,A14,POWER:56;
( N + 1 ) > ( N + ( 0 ) ) by XREAL_1:8;
then A16: n > N by A14,XXREAL_0:2;
then ( t . n ) <= ( c * ( f . n ) ) by A12;
then ( t . n ) <= ( ( c * ( log (a,b) ) ) * ( log (b,n) ) ) by A15;
hence ( t . n ) <= ( ( c * ( log (a,b) ) ) * ( g . n ) ) by A4,A14;
thus ( t . n ) >= ( 0 ) by A12,A16;
end;
( log (a,b) ) > ( log (a,1) ) by A1,A2,POWER:57;
then ( log (a,b) ) > ( 0 ) by A8,A5,POWER:51;
then ( c * ( log (a,b) ) ) > ( c * ( 0 ) ) by A11,XREAL_1:68;
hence x in ( Big_Oh g ) by A9,A13;
end;
assume x in ( Big_Oh g );
then consider t being (Element of ( Funcs (( NAT ),( REAL )) )) such that A17: x = t and A18: (ex c st (ex N st (c > ( 0 ) & (for n holds (n >= N implies (( t . n ) <= ( c * ( g . n ) ) & ( t . n ) >= ( 0 )))))));
consider c,N such that A19: c > ( 0 ) and A20: (for n holds (n >= N implies (( t . n ) <= ( c * ( g . n ) ) & ( t . n ) >= ( 0 )))) by A18;
A21:now
take N1 = ( N + 1 );
let n;
assume A22: n >= N1;
then A23: ( g . n ) = ( log (b,n) ) by A4
.= ( ( log (b,a) ) * ( log (a,n) ) ) by A8,A5,A7,A6,A22,POWER:56;
( N + 1 ) > ( N + ( 0 ) ) by XREAL_1:8;
then A24: n > N by A22,XXREAL_0:2;
then ( t . n ) <= ( c * ( g . n ) ) by A20;
then ( t . n ) <= ( ( c * ( log (b,a) ) ) * ( log (a,n) ) ) by A23;
hence ( t . n ) <= ( ( c * ( log (b,a) ) ) * ( f . n ) ) by A3,A22;
thus ( t . n ) >= ( 0 ) by A20,A24;
end;
( log (b,a) ) > ( log (b,1) ) by A1,A2,POWER:57;
then ( log (b,a) ) > ( 0 ) by A7,A6,POWER:51;
then ( c * ( log (b,a) ) ) > ( c * ( 0 ) ) by A19,XREAL_1:68;
hence x in ( Big_Oh f ) by A17,A21;

hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
