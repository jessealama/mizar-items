definition
let M being PseudoMetricSpace;
func nbourdist M -> (Function of [: ( M -neighbour ),( M -neighbour ) :],( REAL )) means

existence
proof

A1: (for V,Q being (Element of ( M -neighbour )) holds (ex v being (Element of ( REAL )) st P[ V,Q,v ])) by CKB51:1;
consider F being (Function of [: ( M -neighbour ),( M -neighbour ) :],( REAL )) such that A2: (for V,Q being (Element of ( M -neighbour )) holds P[ V,Q,( F . (V,Q) ) ]) from BINOP_1:sch 3(A1);
take F;

proof
