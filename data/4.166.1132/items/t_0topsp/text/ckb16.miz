theorem
Lm1: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (for x,y being (Point of ( T_0-reflex T )) holds (x <> y implies (ex V being (Subset of ( T_0-reflex T )) st (V is  open & ((x in V & (not y in V)) or (y in V & (not x in V))))))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
set S = ( T_0-reflex T );
set F = ( T_0-canonical_map T );
assume (not (for x,y being (Point of S) holds ((not x = y) implies (ex V being (Subset of S) st (V is  open & ((x in V & (not y in V)) or (y in V & (not x in V))))))));
then consider x,y being (Point of S) such that A1: x <> y and A2: (for V being (Subset of S) holds (V is  open implies (x in V iff y in V)));
reconsider x,y as (Point of ( space ( Indiscernible T ) ));
consider p being (Point of T) such that A3: ( F . p ) = x by BORSUK_1:29;
consider q being (Point of T) such that A4: ( F . q ) = y by BORSUK_1:29;
(for A being (Subset of T) holds (A is  open implies (p in A iff q in A)))
proof
let A being (Subset of T);
assume that
A5: A is  open;
F is  open by CKB15:1;
then A6: ( F .: A ) is  open by A5,CKB3:def 1;
reconsider F as (Function of (the carrier of T),(the carrier of S));
hereby
assume p in A;
then x in ( F .: A ) by A3,FUNCT_2:35;
then ( F . q ) in ( F .: A ) by A2,A4,A6;
then (ex x being set st ((x in (the carrier of T) & x in A) & ( F . q ) = ( F . x ))) by FUNCT_2:64;
hence q in A by A5,CKB13:1;
end;
assume q in A;
then y in ( F .: A ) by A4,FUNCT_2:35;
then ( F . p ) in ( F .: A ) by A2,A3,A6;
then (ex x being set st ((x in (the carrier of T) & x in A) & ( F . p ) = ( F . x ))) by FUNCT_2:64;
hence thesis by A5,CKB13:1;
end;
then [ p,q ] in ( Indiscernibility T ) by CKB4:def 1;
hence contradiction by A1,A3,A4,CKB12:1;
end;
