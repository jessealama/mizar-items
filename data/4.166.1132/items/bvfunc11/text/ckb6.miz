theorem
(for G being (Subset of ( PARTITIONS Y )) holds (for A,B being (a_partition of Y) holds (((G is  independent & G = { A,B }) & A <> B) implies ( '/\' G ) = ( A '/\' B ))))
proof
let G being (Subset of ( PARTITIONS Y ));
let A being (a_partition of Y),B being (a_partition of Y);
assume that
A1: G is  independent
and
A2: G = { A,B }
and
A3: A <> B;
A4: ( '/\' G ) c= ( A '/\' B )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( '/\' G );
then consider h being Function,F being (Subset-Family of Y) such that A5: ( dom h ) = G and A6: ( rng h ) = F and A7: (for d being set holds (d in G implies ( h . d ) in d)) and A8: x = ( Intersect F ) and A9: x <> ( {} ) by BVFUNC_2:def 1;

A14: ( ( h . A ) /\ ( h . B ) ) c= x
proof
A15: ( rng h ) = { ( h . A ),( h . B ) }
proof
thus ( rng h ) c= { ( h . A ),( h . B ) }

proof
let m being set;
