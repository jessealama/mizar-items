theorem
Th12: (for A,B being (Subset of GX) holds ((((A is  connected & B is  connected) & A <> ( {} )) & A c= B) implies ( Component_of A ) = ( Component_of B )))
proof
let A being (Subset of GX);
let B being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A1: A is  connected
and
A2: B is  connected
and
A3: A <> ( {} )
and
A4: A c= B;
B <> ( {} ) by A3,A4;
then A5: ( Component_of B ) is  connected by A2,CKB6:1;
A6: B c= ( Component_of B ) by A2,CKB2:1;
then A7: A c= ( Component_of B ) by A4,XBOOLE_1:1;
A8: ( Component_of B ) c= ( Component_of A )
proof
consider F being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A9: (for D being (Subset of GX) holds (D in F iff (D is  connected & A c= D))) and A10: ( union F ) = ( Component_of A ) by CKB1:def 1;
( Component_of B ) in F by A7,A5,A9;
hence thesis by A10,ZFMISC_1:74;
end;
A11: ( Component_of A ) is  connected by A1,A3,CKB6:1;
( Component_of A ) c= ( Component_of B )
proof
consider F being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A12: (for D being (Subset of GX) holds (D in F iff (D is  connected & B c= D))) and A13: ( union F ) = ( Component_of B ) by CKB1:def 1;
B c= ( Component_of A ) by A6,A8,XBOOLE_1:1;
then ( Component_of A ) in F by A11,A12;
hence thesis by A13,ZFMISC_1:74;
end;
hence thesis by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
