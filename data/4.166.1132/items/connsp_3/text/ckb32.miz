reserve GX for non  empty TopSpace;
reserve B for (Subset of GX);
definition
let GX being TopStruct;
let B being (Subset of GX);
let p being (Point of GX);
assume A1: p in B;
func Component_of (p,B) -> (Subset of GX) means 
:Def7: (for q being (Point of ( GX | B )) holds (q = p implies it = ( Component_of q )));
existence
proof
A2: B = ( [#] ( GX | B ) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
then reconsider q3 = p as (Point of ( GX | B )) by A1;
reconsider C = ( Component_of q3 ) as (Subset of GX) by A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
take C;
thus thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
B = ( [#] ( GX | B ) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
then reconsider q3 = p as (Point of ( GX | B )) by A1;
let S being (Subset of GX);
let S9 being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A3: (for q being (Point of ( GX | B )) holds (q = p implies S = ( Component_of q )))
and
A4: (for q2 being (Point of ( GX | B )) holds (q2 = p implies S9 = ( Component_of q2 )));
S = ( Component_of q3 ) by A3;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
