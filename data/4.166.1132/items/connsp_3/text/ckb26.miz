theorem
(for Fu being (Subset-Family of GX) holds ((for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in Fu implies A is (a_union_of_components of GX))) implies ( meet Fu ) is (a_union_of_components of GX)))
proof
let Fu being (Subset-Family of GX);
assume A1: (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in Fu implies A is (a_union_of_components of GX)));
now
per cases ;
case A2: Fu <> ( {} );
{ B: (B is  a_component & (for A2 holds (A2 in Fu implies B c= A2))) } c= ( bool (the carrier of GX) )
proof
let x;
assume x in { B: (B is  a_component & (for A2 holds (A2 in Fu implies B c= A2))) };
then (ex B st ((x = B & B is  a_component) & (for A2 holds (A2 in Fu implies B c= A2))));
hence thesis;

B2 is (a_union_of_components of GX) by A1,A4;

A12: (for B being (Subset of GX) holds (B in F1 implies B is  a_component))
proof
let B being (Subset of GX);

then (ex B1 being (Subset of GX) st ((B = B1 & B1 is  a_component) & (for A2 holds (A2 in Fu implies B1 c= A2))));
hence thesis;
end;
( union F1 ) c= ( meet Fu )
proof
let x;
assume x in ( union F1 );
then consider X such that A13: x in X and A14: X in F1 by TARSKI:def 4;
consider B such that A15: X = B and B is  a_component and A16: (for A2 holds (A2 in Fu implies B c= A2)) by A14;
(for Y holds (Y in Fu implies x in Y))
proof
let Y;
assume Y in Fu;
then B c= Y by A16;
hence thesis by A13,A15;
end;
hence thesis by A2,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
then ( meet Fu ) = ( union F1 ) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 10;

case Fu = ( {} );
then ( meet Fu ) = ( {} GX ) by SETFAM_1:def 1;
