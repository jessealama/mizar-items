begin
reserve GX for non  empty TopSpace;
theorem
Th5: (for GX being TopSpace holds (for V being (Subset of GX) holds ((V is  connected & V <> ( {} )) implies ( Component_of V ) is  connected)))
proof
let GX being TopSpace;
let V being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A1: V is  connected
and
A2: V <> ( {} );
consider F being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A3: (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F iff (A is  connected & V c= A))) and A4: ( Component_of V ) = ( union F ) by CKB1:def 1;
A5: (for A being set holds (A in F implies V c= A)) by A3;
F <> ( {} ) by A1,A3;
then V c= ( meet F ) by A5,SETFAM_1:5;
then A6: ( meet F ) <> ( {} GX ) by A2;
(for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F implies A is  connected)) by A3;
hence thesis by A4,A6,CONNSP_1:26;
