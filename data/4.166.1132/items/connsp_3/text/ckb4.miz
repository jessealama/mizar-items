theorem
Th3: ( Component_of ( {} GX ) ) = (the carrier of GX)
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex A1 being (Subset of GX) st ((A1 = $1 & A1 is  connected) & ( {} GX ) c= $1));
consider F being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A1: (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F iff P[ A ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
A2: (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F iff (A is  connected & ( {} GX ) c= A)))
proof
let A being (Subset of GX);
thus (A in F implies (A is  connected & ( {} GX ) c= A))
proof
assume A in F;
then (ex A1 being (Subset of GX) st ((A1 = A & A1 is  connected) & ( {} GX ) c= A)) by A1;
hence thesis;
end;

thus thesis by A1;
end;
now
let x being set;
hereby
assume x in (the carrier of GX);
then reconsider p = x as (Point of GX);
reconsider Y = ( Component_of p ) as set;
take Y;
thus x in Y by CONNSP_1:38;
(( Component_of p ) is  connected & ( {} GX ) c= Y) by XBOOLE_1:2;
hence Y in F by A2;
end;
given Y being set such that
A3: (x in Y & Y in F);

thus x in (the carrier of GX) by A3;
end;
then ( union F ) = (the carrier of GX) by TARSKI:def 4;
hence thesis by A2,CKB1:def 1;
end;
