begin
reserve GX for non  empty TopSpace;
theorem
Th1: (for GX being TopSpace holds (for V being (Subset of GX) holds ((ex A being (Subset of GX) st (A is  connected & V c= A)) implies V c= ( Component_of V ))))
proof
let GX being TopSpace;
let V being (Subset of GX);
given A being (Subset of GX) such that
A1: (A is  connected & V c= A);

consider F being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A2: (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F iff (A is  connected & V c= A))) and A3: ( Component_of V ) = ( union F ) by CKB1:def 1;
A4: (for A being set holds (A in F implies V c= A)) by A2;
F <> ( {} ) by A1,A2;
then A5: V c= ( meet F ) by A4,SETFAM_1:5;
( meet F ) c= ( union F ) by SETFAM_1:2;
hence thesis by A3,A5,XBOOLE_1:1;
