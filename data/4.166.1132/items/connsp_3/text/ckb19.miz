reserve B for (Subset of GX);
theorem
(for A,B being (Subset of GX) holds ((((A is  a_component & B is  connected) & B <> ( {} )) & A misses B) implies A misses ( Component_of B )))
proof
let A being (Subset of GX);
let B being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A1: A is  a_component
and
A2: (B is  connected & B <> ( {} ))
and
A3: ( A /\ B ) = ( {} );
A4: A is  connected by A1;
assume ( A /\ ( Component_of B ) ) <> ( {} );
then consider x being (Point of GX) such that A5: x in ( A /\ ( Component_of B ) ) by SUBSET_1:4;
x in A by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A6: ( Component_of x ) = ( Component_of A ) by A4,CKB16:1;
A7: x in ( Component_of B ) by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
(( Component_of A ) = A & ( Component_of B ) = ( Component_of ( Component_of B ) )) by A1,A2,CKB8:1,CKB12:1;
then ( ( Component_of B ) /\ B ) = ( {} ) by A2,A3,A7,A6,CKB6:1,CKB16:1;
hence contradiction by A2,CKB2:1,XBOOLE_1:28;
end;
