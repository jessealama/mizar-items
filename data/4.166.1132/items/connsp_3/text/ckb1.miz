definition
let GX being TopStruct;
let V being (Subset of GX);
func Component_of V -> (Subset of GX) means 
:Def1: (ex F being (Subset-Family of GX) st ((for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F iff (A is  connected & V c= A))) & ( union F ) = it));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex A1 being (Subset of GX) st ((A1 = $1 & A1 is  connected) & V c= $1));
consider F being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A1: (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F iff P[ A ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
take ( union F );
take F;
thus (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F iff (A is  connected & V c= A)))
proof
let A being (Subset of GX);
thus (A in F implies (A is  connected & V c= A))
proof
assume A in F;
then (ex A1 being (Subset of GX) st ((A1 = A & A1 is  connected) & V c= A)) by A1;
hence thesis;
end;

thus thesis by A1;
end;

thus thesis;

reconsider B as (Subset of GX) by A10;
(B is  connected & V c= B) by A6,A10;
then B in F by A4;
hence y in S by A5,A9,TARSKI:def 4;

now
assume y in S;
then consider B being set such that A11: y in B and A12: B in F by A5,TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider B as (Subset of GX) by A12;
(B is  connected & V c= B) by A4,A12;
