theorem
(for Fu being (Subset-Family of GX) holds ((for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in Fu implies A is (a_union_of_components of GX))) implies ( union Fu ) is (a_union_of_components of GX)))
proof
let Fu being (Subset-Family of GX);
{ B: (ex B2 st ((B2 in Fu & B c= B2) & B is  a_component)) } c= ( bool (the carrier of GX) )
proof
let x;
assume x in { B: (ex B2 st ((B2 in Fu & B c= B2) & B is  a_component)) };
then (ex B st (x = B & (ex B2 st ((B2 in Fu & B c= B2) & B is  a_component))));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider F2 = { B: (ex B2 st ((B2 in Fu & B c= B2) & B is  a_component)) } as (Subset-Family of GX);
A1: (for B being (Subset of GX) holds (B in F2 implies B is  a_component))
proof

reconsider B3 = X2 as (Subset of GX) by A5;
B3 is (a_union_of_components of GX) by A2,A5;
