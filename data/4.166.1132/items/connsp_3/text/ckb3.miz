begin
reserve GX for non  empty TopSpace;
theorem
(for GX being TopSpace holds (for V being (Subset of GX) holds ((not (ex A being (Subset of GX) st (A is  connected & V c= A))) implies ( Component_of V ) = ( {} ))))
proof
let GX being TopSpace;
let V being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A1: (not (ex A being (Subset of GX) st (A is  connected & V c= A)));
consider F being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A2: (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F iff (A is  connected & V c= A))) and A3: ( Component_of V ) = ( union F ) by CKB1:def 1;
now
assume F <> ( {} );
then consider A being (Subset of GX) such that A4: A in F by SUBSET_1:4;
reconsider A as (Subset of GX);
(A is  connected & V c= A) by A2,A4;
hence contradiction by A1;
end;
hence thesis by A3,ZFMISC_1:2;
end;
