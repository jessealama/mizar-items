theorem
(for A,B being (Subset of GX) holds ((A is (a_union_of_components of GX) & B is (a_union_of_components of GX)) implies ( A \ B ) is (a_union_of_components of GX)))
proof
let A being (Subset of GX);
let B being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A1: A is (a_union_of_components of GX)
and
A2: B is (a_union_of_components of GX);
consider Fa being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A3: (for B2 being (Subset of GX) holds (B2 in Fa implies B2 is  a_component)) and A4: A = ( union Fa ) by A1,CKB20:def 1;
consider Fb being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A5: (for B3 being (Subset of GX) holds (B3 in Fb implies B3 is  a_component)) and A6: B = ( union Fb ) by A2,CKB20:def 1;
reconsider Fd = ( Fa \ Fb ) as (Subset-Family of GX);
A7: ( union Fd ) c= ( A \ B )
proof
let x;
assume x in ( union Fd );
then consider X such that A8: x in X and A9: X in Fd by TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider A2 = X as (Subset of GX) by A9;
A10: (not X in Fb) by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
A11: X in Fa by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then A12: A2 is  a_component by A3;
A13:now
assume x in B;
then consider Y3 being set such that A14: x in Y3 and A15: Y3 in Fb by A6,TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider B3 = Y3 as (Subset of GX) by A15;
( A2 /\ B3 ) <> ( {} ) by A8,A14,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A16: A2 meets B3 by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
B3 is  a_component by A5,A15;
hence contradiction by A10,A12,A15,A16,CONNSP_1:35;
end;
A2 c= A by A4,A11,ZFMISC_1:74;
hence thesis by A8,A13,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
A17: (for B4 being (Subset of GX) holds (B4 in Fd implies B4 is  a_component))
proof
let B4 being (Subset of GX);
assume B4 in Fd;
then B4 in Fa by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
( A \ B ) c= ( union Fd )
proof
let x;
assume A18: x in ( A \ B );
then x in A by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then consider X such that A19: x in X and A20: X in Fa by A4,TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider A2 = X as (Subset of GX) by A20;
now
assume A2 in Fb;
then A2 c= B by A6,ZFMISC_1:74;
hence contradiction by A18,A19,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
then A2 in Fd by A20,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence thesis by A19,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
then ( A \ B ) = ( union Fd ) by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by A17,CKB20:def 1;
end;
