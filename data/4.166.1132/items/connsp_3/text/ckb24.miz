theorem
(for A,B being (Subset of GX) holds ((A is (a_union_of_components of GX) & B is (a_union_of_components of GX)) implies (( A \/ B ) is (a_union_of_components of GX) & ( A /\ B ) is (a_union_of_components of GX))))
proof
let A being (Subset of GX);
let B being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A1: A is (a_union_of_components of GX)
and
A2: B is (a_union_of_components of GX);
consider Fa being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A3: (for Ba being (Subset of GX) holds (Ba in Fa implies Ba is  a_component)) and A4: A = ( union Fa ) by A1,CKB20:def 1;
consider Fb being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A5: (for Bb being (Subset of GX) holds (Bb in Fb implies Bb is  a_component)) and A6: B = ( union Fb ) by A2,CKB20:def 1;
A7: (for B2 being (Subset of GX) holds (B2 in ( Fa \/ Fb ) implies B2 is  a_component))
proof
let B2 being (Subset of GX);
assume B2 in ( Fa \/ Fb );
then (B2 in Fa or B2 in Fb) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence thesis by A3,A5;
end;
A8: ( A /\ B ) is (a_union_of_components of GX)
proof
reconsider Fd = ( Fa /\ Fb ) as (Subset-Family of GX);
A9: (for B4 being (Subset of GX) holds (B4 in Fd implies B4 is  a_component))
proof
let B4 being (Subset of GX);
assume B4 in Fd;
then B4 in Fa by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
A10: ( A /\ B ) c= ( union Fd )
proof
let x being set;
assume A11: x in ( A /\ B );
then x in A by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider F1 being set such that A12: x in F1 and A13: F1 in Fa by A4,TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider C1 = F1 as (Subset of GX) by A13;
x in B by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider F2 being set such that A14: x in F2 and A15: F2 in Fb by A6,TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider C2 = F2 as (Subset of GX) by A15;
A16: C2 is  a_component by A5,A15;
C1 is  a_component by A3,A13;
then A17: (C1 = C2 or C1 misses C2) by A16,CONNSP_1:35;
( F1 /\ F2 ) <> ( {} ) by A12,A14,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then C1 in ( Fa /\ Fb ) by A13,A15,A17,XBOOLE_0:def 4,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
hence thesis by A12,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
( union Fd ) c= ( A /\ B )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( union Fd );
then consider X4 being set such that A18: x in X4 and A19: X4 in Fd by TARSKI:def 4;
X4 in Fb by A19,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A20: x in ( union Fb ) by A18,TARSKI:def 4;
X4 in Fa by A19,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then x in ( union Fa ) by A18,TARSKI:def 4;
hence thesis by A4,A6,A20,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
then ( A /\ B ) = ( union Fd ) by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by A9,CKB20:def 1;
end;
reconsider Fc = ( Fa \/ Fb ) as (Subset-Family of GX);
( A \/ B ) = ( union Fc ) by A4,A6,ZFMISC_1:78;
hence thesis by A7,A8,CKB20:def 1;
