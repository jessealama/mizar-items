theorem
Lm6: (((((( 0. L ) <> ( 1. L ) & (for a holds ( a * ( 1. L ) ) = a)) & (for a holds (a <> ( 0. L ) implies (ex x st ( a * x ) = ( 1. L ))))) & (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ( ( a * b ) * c ) = ( a * ( b * c ) ))))) & (for a holds ( a * ( 0. L ) ) = ( 0. L ))) implies (( a * b ) = ( 1. L ) implies ( b * a ) = ( 1. L )))
proof
assume that
A1: ( 0. L ) <> ( 1. L )
and
A2: (for a holds ( a * ( 1. L ) ) = a)
and
A3: (for a holds (a <> ( 0. L ) implies (ex x st ( a * x ) = ( 1. L ))))
and
A4: (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ( ( a * b ) * c ) = ( a * ( b * c ) ))))
and
A5: (for a holds ( a * ( 0. L ) ) = ( 0. L ));
thus (( a * b ) = ( 1. L ) implies ( b * a ) = ( 1. L ))
proof
assume A6: ( a * b ) = ( 1. L );
then b <> ( 0. L ) by A1,A5;
then consider x such that A7: ( b * x ) = ( 1. L ) by A3;
thus ( b * a ) = ( ( b * a ) * ( b * x ) ) by A2,A7
.= ( ( ( b * a ) * b ) * x ) by A4
.= ( ( b * ( 1. L ) ) * x ) by A4,A6
.= ( 1. L ) by A2,A7;
