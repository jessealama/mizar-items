theorem
(L is _Field iff (((((((((((for a holds ( a + ( 0. L ) ) = a) & (for a holds (ex x st ( a + x ) = ( 0. L )))) & (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ( ( a + b ) + c ) = ( a + ( b + c ) ))))) & (for a holds (for b holds ( a + b ) = ( b + a )))) & ( 0. L ) <> ( 1. L )) & (for a holds ( a * ( 1. L ) ) = a)) & (for a holds (a <> ( 0. L ) implies (ex x st ( a * x ) = ( 1. L ))))) & (for a holds ( a * ( 0. L ) ) = ( 0. L ))) & (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ( ( a * b ) * c ) = ( a * ( b * c ) ))))) & (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ( a * ( b + c ) ) = ( ( a * b ) + ( a * c ) ))))) & (for a holds (for b holds ( a * b ) = ( b * a )))))
proof
thus (L is _Field implies (((((((((((for a holds ( a + ( 0. L ) ) = a) & (for a holds (ex x st ( a + x ) = ( 0. L )))) & (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ( ( a + b ) + c ) = ( a + ( b + c ) ))))) & (for a holds (for b holds ( a + b ) = ( b + a )))) & ( 0. L ) <> ( 1. L )) & (for a holds ( a * ( 1. L ) ) = a)) & (for a holds (a <> ( 0. L ) implies (ex x st ( a * x ) = ( 1. L ))))) & (for a holds ( a * ( 0. L ) ) = ( 0. L ))) & (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ( ( a * b ) * c ) = ( a * ( b * c ) ))))) & (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ( a * ( b + c ) ) = ( ( a * b ) + ( a * c ) ))))) & (for a holds (for b holds ( a * b ) = ( b * a ))))) by CKB28:1,GROUP_1:def 12;
assume that
A1: ((((for a holds ( a + ( 0. L ) ) = a) & (for a holds (ex x st ( a + x ) = ( 0. L )))) & ((for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ( ( a + b ) + c ) = ( a + ( b + c ) )))) & (for a holds (for b holds ( a + b ) = ( b + a ))))) & ((( 0. L ) <> ( 1. L ) & (for a holds ( a * ( 1. L ) ) = a)) & (for a holds (a <> ( 0. L ) implies (ex x st ( a * x ) = ( 1. L ))))))
and
A2: (for a holds ( a * ( 0. L ) ) = ( 0. L ))
and
A3: (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ( ( a * b ) * c ) = ( a * ( b * c ) ))))
and
A4: (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ( a * ( b + c ) ) = ( ( a * b ) + ( a * c ) ))))
and
A5: (for a holds (for b holds ( a * b ) = ( b * a )));
A6: (for a holds ( ( 0. L ) * a ) = ( 0. L ))
proof
let a;
thus ( ( 0. L ) * a ) = ( a * ( 0. L ) ) by A5
.= ( 0. L ) by A2;
end;
(for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ( ( b + c ) * a ) = ( ( b * a ) + ( c * a ) ))))
proof
let a;
let b;
let c;
thus ( ( b + c ) * a ) = ( a * ( b + c ) ) by A5
.= ( ( a * b ) + ( a * c ) ) by A4
.= ( ( b * a ) + ( a * c ) ) by A5
.= ( ( b * a ) + ( c * a ) ) by A5;
