proof
let a;
let b;
consider y such that A7: ( y + a ) = ( 0. L ) by A1,A2,A3,ALGSTR_1:3;
take x = ( b + y );
thus ( x + a ) = ( b + ( 0. L ) ) by A3,A7
.= b by A1;
end;
A8: (for a holds ( ( 0. L ) + a ) = a)
proof
let a;
thus ( ( 0. L ) + a ) = ( a + ( 0. L ) ) by A4
.= a by A1;
end;
A9: (for a holds (for x holds (for y holds (( a + x ) = ( a + y ) implies x = y))))
proof
let a;
let x;
let y;
consider z such that A10: ( z + a ) = ( 0. L ) by A1,A2,A3,ALGSTR_1:3;
assume ( a + x ) = ( a + y );
then ( ( z + a ) + x ) = ( z + ( a + y ) ) by A3
.= ( ( z + a ) + y ) by A3;
hence x = ( ( 0. L ) + y ) by A8,A10
.= y by A8;
end;
A11: (for a holds (for x holds (for y holds (( x + a ) = ( y + a ) implies x = y))))
proof
let a;
let x;
let y;
consider z such that A12: ( a + z ) = ( 0. L ) by A2;
assume ( x + a ) = ( y + a );
then ( x + ( a + z ) ) = ( ( y + a ) + z ) by A3
.= ( y + ( a + z ) ) by A3;
hence x = ( y + ( 0. L ) ) by A1,A12
.= y by A1;
end;
(for a holds (for b holds (ex x st ( a + x ) = b)))
proof
let a;
let b;
consider y such that A13: ( a + y ) = ( 0. L ) by A2;
take x = ( y + b );
thus ( a + x ) = ( ( 0. L ) + b ) by A3,A13
