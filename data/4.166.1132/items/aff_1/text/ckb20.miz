definition
let AS;
let a;
let b;
func Line (a,b) -> (Subset of AS)
means
:Def2: (for x holds (x in it iff  LIN a,b,x));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(for y holds (y = $1 implies  LIN a,b,y));
consider X being (Subset of AS) such that A1: (for x being set holds (x in X iff (x in (the carrier of AS) & P[ x ]))) from SUBSET_1:sch 1;
take X;
let x;
thus (x in X implies  LIN a,b,x) by A1;
assume  LIN a,b,x;
then (for y holds (y = x implies  LIN a,b,y));
hence thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let X1 being (Subset of AS),X2 being (Subset of AS);
assume that
A2: (for x holds (x in X1 iff  LIN a,b,x))
and
A3: (for x holds (x in X2 iff  LIN a,b,x));
(for x being set holds (x in X1 iff x in X2))
proof
let x being set;
thus (x in X1 implies x in X2)
proof
assume A4: x in X1;
then reconsider x9 = x as (Element of AS);
 LIN a,b,x9 by A2,A4;
hence thesis by A3;
end;

assume A5: x in X2;
then reconsider x9 = x as (Element of AS);
 LIN a,b,x9 by A3,A5;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
end;
