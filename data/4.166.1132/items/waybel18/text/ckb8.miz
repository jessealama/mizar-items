existence
proof
defpred P[ (Subset of ( product ( Carrier J ) )) ]
 means
(ex i being set st (ex T being TopStruct st (ex V being (Subset of T) st (((i in I & V is  open) & T = ( J . i )) & $1 = ( product ( ( Carrier J ) +* (i,V) ) )))));

end;
uniqueness
proof
let P1 being (Subset-Family of ( product ( Carrier J ) ));
let P2 being (Subset-Family of ( product ( Carrier J ) ));
assume that
A1: (for x being (Subset of ( product ( Carrier J ) )) holds (x in P1 iff (ex i being set st (ex T being TopStruct st (ex V being (Subset of T) st (((i in I & V is  open) & T = ( J . i )) & x = ( product ( ( Carrier J ) +* (i,V) ) )))))))

A3: P2 c= P1
proof
let x being set;
assume A4: x in P2;
then reconsider x9 = x as (Subset of ( product ( Carrier J ) ));
(ex i being set st (ex T being TopStruct st (ex V being (Subset of T) st (((i in I & V is  open) & T = ( J . i )) & x9 = ( product ( ( Carrier J ) +* (i,V) ) ))))) by A2,A4;

P1 c= P2
proof
let x being set;
