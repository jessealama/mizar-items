theorem
(for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (T is  injective implies (for S being non  empty (SubSpace of T) holds (S is_a_retract_of T implies S is  injective))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
assume A1: T is  injective;
let S being non  empty (SubSpace of T);
set p = ( incl S );
assume S is_a_retract_of T;
then consider r being  continuous (Function of T,S) such that A2: r is  being_a_retraction by BORSUK_1:def 17;
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
let F being (Function of X,S);
assume A3: F is  continuous;
reconsider f = ( p * F ) as (Function of X,T);
let Y being non  empty TopSpace;
assume A4: X is (SubSpace of Y);
p is  continuous by TMAP_1:87;
then consider g being (Function of Y,T) such that A5: g is  continuous and A6: ( g | (the carrier of X) ) = f by A1,A3,A4,CKB19:def 1;
take G = ( r * g );
A7: (the carrier of S) c= (the carrier of T) by BORSUK_1:1;
A8: (the carrier of X) c= (the carrier of Y) by A4,BORSUK_1:1;
A9: (for x being set holds (x in ( dom F ) implies ( F . x ) = ( G . x )))
proof
let x being set;
assume A10: x in ( dom F );
then A11: (x in (the carrier of X) & ( g . x ) = ( f . x )) by A6,FUNCT_1:49;
A12: ( F . x ) in ( rng F ) by A10,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then ( F . x ) in (the carrier of S);
then reconsider y = ( F . x ) as (Point of T) by A7;
A13: ( f . x ) = ( p . y ) by A10,FUNCT_2:15
.= ( F . x ) by A12,TMAP_1:84;
( F . x ) = ( r . y ) by A2,A12,BORSUK_1:def 16;
hence thesis by A8,A13,A11,FUNCT_2:15;
end;
thus G is  continuous by A5;
A14: ( dom F ) = (the carrier of X) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
( ( dom G ) /\ (the carrier of X) ) = ( (the carrier of Y) /\ (the carrier of X) ) by FUNCT_2:def 1
.= (the carrier of X) by A4,BORSUK_1:1,XBOOLE_1:28;
hence thesis by A14,A9,FUNCT_1:46;
end;
