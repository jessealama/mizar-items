theorem
(for X being LinearTopSpace holds (for A being (Subset of X) holds ( Cl A ) = ( meet { ( A + V ) where V is (a_neighborhood of ( 0. X )): (not contradiction) } )))
proof
let X being LinearTopSpace;
let A being (Subset of X);
set AV = { ( A + V ) where V is (a_neighborhood of ( 0. X )): (not contradiction) };
set V = the (a_neighborhood of ( 0. X ));
A1: (for x being (Point of X) holds (for V being (a_neighborhood of ( 0. X )) holds (A meets ( x + ( Int V ) ) iff x in ( A + ( ( - 1 ) * ( Int V ) ) ))))
proof
let x being (Point of X);
let V being (a_neighborhood of ( 0. X ));
A2: ( A + ( ( - 1 ) * ( Int V ) ) ) = { ( a + v ) where a is (Point of X),v is (Point of X): (a in A & v in ( ( - 1 ) * ( Int V ) )) } by RUSUB_4:def 9;
hereby
assume A meets ( x + ( Int V ) );
then x in ( A + ( - ( Int V ) ) ) by CKB36:1;
hence x in ( A + ( ( - 1 ) * ( Int V ) ) );
end;
assume x in ( A + ( ( - 1 ) * ( Int V ) ) );
then consider a being (Point of X),v being (Point of X) such that A3: x = ( a + v ) and A4: a in A and A5: v in ( ( - 1 ) * ( Int V ) ) by A2;
consider v9 being (Point of X) such that A6: v = ( ( - 1 ) * v9 ) and A7: v9 in ( Int V ) by A5;

proof
