Th58: (for X being LinearTopSpace holds (for K being  compact (Subset of X) holds (for C being  closed (Subset of X) holds (K misses C implies (ex V being (a_neighborhood of ( 0. X )) st ( K + V ) misses ( C + V ))))))
proof

let C being  closed (Subset of X);
assume that
A1: K misses C;
per cases ;
suppose A2: K = ( {} );

take V = ( [#] X );
thus V is (a_neighborhood of ( 0. X )) by TOPGRP_1:21;
( K + V ) = ( {} ) by A2,CONVEX1:40;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_1:65;
end;
suppose A3: K <> ( {} );

then ( ( - x ) + x ) in ( ( - x ) + ( C ` ) ) by A5;
then ( 0. X ) in ( ( - x ) + ( C ` ) ) by RLVECT_1:5;
then ( ( - x ) + ( C ` ) ) is (a_neighborhood of ( 0. X )) by CONNSP_2:3;
then consider V9 being  open (a_neighborhood of ( 0. X )) such that V9 is  symmetric and A6: ( V9 + V9 ) c= ( ( - x ) + ( C ` ) ) by CKB109:1;
consider Vx being  open (a_neighborhood of ( 0. X )) such that A7: Vx is  symmetric and A8: ( Vx + Vx ) c= V9 by CKB109:1;
take Vx;
thus Vx is  symmetric by A7;
Vx c= V9
proof
let z being set;
assume A9: z in Vx;
then reconsider z as (Point of X);

then ( ( Vx + Vx ) + Vx ) c= ( ( - x ) + ( C ` ) ) by A6,XBOOLE_1:1;
then ( x + ( ( Vx + Vx ) + Vx ) ) c= ( x + ( ( - x ) + ( C ` ) ) ) by CKB11:1;
then ( ( x + Vx ) + ( Vx + Vx ) ) c= ( x + ( ( - x ) + ( C ` ) ) ) by CKB10:1;
then ( ( ( x + Vx ) + Vx ) + Vx ) c= ( x + ( ( - x ) + ( C ` ) ) ) by CONVEX1:36;
then ( ( ( x + Vx ) + Vx ) + Vx ) c= ( ( x + ( - x ) ) + ( C ` ) ) by CKB9:1;
then ( ( ( x + Vx ) + Vx ) + Vx ) c= ( ( 0. X ) + ( C ` ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 10;
then ( ( ( x + Vx ) + Vx ) + Vx ) c= ( C ` ) by CKB8:1;
