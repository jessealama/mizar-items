theorem
Th30: (for X being non  empty  compact TopSpace holds (for Y being (Subset of ( C_Normed_Algebra_of_BoundedFunctions (the carrier of X) )) holds (Y = ( CContinuousFunctions X ) implies Y is  closed)))
proof
let X being non  empty  compact TopSpace;
let Y being (Subset of ( C_Normed_Algebra_of_BoundedFunctions (the carrier of X) ));
assume A1: Y = ( CContinuousFunctions X );
now
let seq being (sequence of ( C_Normed_Algebra_of_BoundedFunctions (the carrier of X) ));
assume A2: (( rng seq ) c= Y & seq is  convergent);
( lim seq ) in ( ComplexBoundedFunctions (the carrier of X) );
then consider f being (Function of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) such that A3: (f = ( lim seq ) & ( f | (the carrier of X) ) is  bounded);
now
let z being set;
assume z in ( ComplexBoundedFunctions (the carrier of X) );
then (ex f being (Function of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) st (f = z & ( f | (the carrier of X) ) is  bounded));
hence z in ( PFuncs ((the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) ) by PARTFUN1:45;
end;
then ( ComplexBoundedFunctions (the carrier of X) ) c= ( PFuncs ((the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) ) by TARSKI:def 3;
then reconsider H = seq as (Functional_Sequence of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) by FUNCT_2:7;
A4: (for p being Real holds (p > ( 0 ) implies (ex k being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for x being set holds ((n >= k & x in (the carrier of X)) implies ( abs ( ( ( H . n ) . x ) - ( f . x ) ) ) < p))))))
proof
let p being Real;
assume p > ( 0 );
then consider k being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A5: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n >= k implies ||. ( ( seq . n ) - ( lim seq ) ) .|| < p)) by A2,CLVECT_1:def 16;
take k;
hereby
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
let x being set;
assume A6: (n >= k & x in (the carrier of X));
then A7: ||. ( ( seq . n ) - ( lim seq ) ) .|| < p by A5;
( ( seq . n ) - ( lim seq ) ) in ( ComplexBoundedFunctions (the carrier of X) );
then consider g being (Function of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) such that A8: (g = ( ( seq . n ) - ( lim seq ) ) & ( g | (the carrier of X) ) is  bounded);
( seq . n ) in ( ComplexBoundedFunctions (the carrier of X) );
then consider s being (Function of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) such that A9: (s = ( seq . n ) & ( s | (the carrier of X) ) is  bounded);
reconsider x0 = x as (Element of (the carrier of X)) by A6;
A10: ( g . x0 ) = ( ( s . x0 ) - ( f . x0 ) ) by A8,A9,A3,CC0SP1:26;
( abs ( g . x0 ) ) <= ||. ( ( seq . n ) - ( lim seq ) ) .|| by A8,CC0SP1:19;
hence ( abs ( ( ( H . n ) . x ) - ( f . x ) ) ) < p by A10,A9,A7,XXREAL_0:2;
end;
end;
f is  continuous
proof
set n = the (Element of ( NAT ));
(for x being (Point of X) holds (for V being (Subset of ( COMPLEX )) holds ((( f . x ) in V & V is  open) implies (ex W being (Subset of X) st ((x in W & W is  open) & ( f .: W ) c= V)))))
proof
let x being (Point of X);

then k in ( dom seq ) by NORMSP_1:12;
then ( H . k ) in ( rng seq ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
then ( H . k ) in Y by A2;

set z1 = ( h . x );
set G1 = { p where p is Complex: |. ( p - z1 ) .| < ( r / 3 ) };
G1 c= ( COMPLEX )
proof
let z being set;
assume z in G1;
then (ex y being Complex st (z = y & |. ( y - z1 ) .| < ( r / 3 )));
hence z in ( COMPLEX );
end;
then reconsider T1 = G1 as (Subset of ( COMPLEX ));
A17: T1 is  open by CFDIFF_1:13,A14;
|. ( z1 - z1 ) .| = ( 0 );

end;
then ( f .: W1 ) c= S by TARSKI:def 3;
then ( f .: W1 ) c= N by A13,XBOOLE_1:1;
hence (ex W being (Subset of X) st ((x in W & W is  open) & ( f .: W ) c= V)) by A18,A12,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
hence f is  continuous by CKB7:1;

hence ( lim seq ) in Y by A3,A1;

hence Y is  closed by NCFCONT1:def 3;
