theorem
Th3: (for X being non  empty TopSpace holds (for f being (Function of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) holds (f is  continuous iff (for x being (Point of X) holds (for V being (Subset of ( COMPLEX )) holds ((( f . x ) in V & V is  open) implies (ex W being (Subset of X) st ((x in W & W is  open) & ( f .: W ) c= V))))))))
proof
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
let f being (Function of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX ));
hereby
assume A1: f is  continuous;
now
let x being (Point of X);
let V being (Subset of ( COMPLEX ));
set z = ( f . x );
reconsider z0 = z as Complex;
assume (z in V & V is  open);
then consider N being (Neighbourhood of z0) such that A2: N c= V by CFDIFF_1:9;
consider g being Real such that A3: (( 0 ) < g & { y where y is Complex: |. ( y - z0 ) .| < g } c= N) by CFDIFF_1:def 5;
set S = { y where y is Complex: |. ( y - z0 ) .| < g };
S c= ( COMPLEX )
proof
let z being set;
assume z in S;
then (ex y being Complex st (z = y & |. ( y - z0 ) .| < g));
hence z in ( COMPLEX );
end;
then reconsider S1 = S as (Subset of ( COMPLEX ));
take W = ( f " S );
A4: S1 is  open by CFDIFF_1:13;
S is (Neighbourhood of z0) by CFDIFF_1:6,A3;
then ( f . x ) in S by CFDIFF_1:7;
hence x in W by FUNCT_2:38;
thus W is  open by A1,A4,CKB6:1;
( f .: ( f " S ) ) c= S by FUNCT_1:75;
then ( f .: W ) c= N by A3,XBOOLE_1:1;
hence ( f .: W ) c= V by A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
hence (for x being (Point of X) holds (for V being (Subset of ( COMPLEX )) holds ((( f . x ) in V & V is  open) implies (ex W being (Subset of X) st ((x in W & W is  open) & ( f .: W ) c= V)))));
end;
assume A5: (for x being (Point of X) holds (for V being (Subset of ( COMPLEX )) holds ((( f . x ) in V & V is  open) implies (ex W being (Subset of X) st ((x in W & W is  open) & ( f .: W ) c= V)))));
now
let Y being (Subset of ( COMPLEX ));
assume Y is  closed;
then ( ( Y ` ) ` ) is  closed;
then A6: ( Y ` ) is  open by CFDIFF_1:def 11;
(for x being (Point of X) holds (x in ( ( f " Y ) ` ) implies (ex W being (Subset of X) st (W is (a_neighborhood of x) & W c= ( ( f " Y ) ` )))))
proof
let x being (Point of X);
assume x in ( ( f " Y ) ` );
then x in ( f " ( Y ` ) ) by FUNCT_2:100;
then ( f . x ) in ( Y ` ) by FUNCT_2:38;
then consider V being (Subset of ( COMPLEX )) such that A7: ((( f . x ) in V & V is  open) & V c= ( Y ` )) by A6;
consider W being (Subset of X) such that A8: ((x in W & W is  open) & ( f .: W ) c= V) by A5,A7;
take W;
thus W is (a_neighborhood of x) by A8,CONNSP_2:3;
( f .: W ) c= ( Y ` ) by A7,A8,XBOOLE_1:1;
then A9: ( f " ( f .: W ) ) c= ( f " ( Y ` ) ) by RELAT_1:143;
W c= ( f " ( f .: W ) ) by FUNCT_2:42;
then W c= ( f " ( Y ` ) ) by A9,XBOOLE_1:1;
hence W c= ( ( f " Y ) ` ) by FUNCT_2:100;
end;
then ( ( f " Y ) ` ) is  open by CONNSP_2:7;
then ( ( ( f " Y ) ` ) ` ) is  closed by TOPS_1:4;
hence ( f " Y ) is  closed;
end;
hence f is  continuous by CKB1:def 1;
end;
