proof

(for v,u being (Element of V) holds ((v in W & u in W) implies ( v + u ) in W))
proof
let v being (Element of V);

consider v1 being  continuous (Function of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) such that A2: v1 = v by A1;

(for x being set holds (x in ( dom h ) implies ( h . x ) = ( ( v1 . x ) + ( u1 . x ) ))) by A2,A3,CFUNCDOM:1;
then A6: ( v + u ) = ( v1 + u1 ) by A5,A4,VALUED_1:def 1;
( v1 + u1 ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) by CKB8:1;
hence ( v + u ) in W by A6;

proof

(for x being set holds (x in ( dom h ) implies ( h . x ) = ( a * ( u1 . x ) ))) by A16,CFUNCDOM:4;

( a (#) u1 ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) by CKB9:1;
hence ( a * u ) in W by A19;

hence ( CContinuousFunctions X ) is  Cadditively-linearly-closed by A7,A14,CC0SP1:def 2;
A20: (for v,u being (Element of V) holds ((v in W & u in W) implies ( v * u ) in W))
proof
let v being (Element of V);

(for x being set holds (x in ( dom h ) implies ( h . x ) = ( ( v1 . x ) * ( u1 . x ) ))) by A22,A23,CFUNCDOM:2;

( v1 (#) u1 ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) by CKB11:1;

end;
reconsider g = ( ComplexFuncUnit (the carrier of X) ) as (Function of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX ));
