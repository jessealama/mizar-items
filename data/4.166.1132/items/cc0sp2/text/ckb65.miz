theorem
Lm9: (for X being non  empty TopSpace holds (for v,u being (Element of ( CAlgebra (the carrier of X) )) holds ((v in ( CC_0_Functions X ) & u in ( CC_0_Functions X )) implies ( v + u ) in ( CC_0_Functions X ))))
proof
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
set W = ( CC_0_Functions X );
set V = ( CAlgebra (the carrier of X) );
let u being (Element of V);
let v being (Element of V);
assume that
A1: (u in W & v in W);
consider u1 being (Function of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) such that A2: ((u1 = u & u1 is  continuous) & (ex Y1 being non  empty (Subset of X) st (Y1 is  compact & (for A1 being (Subset of X) holds (A1 = ( support u1 ) implies ( Cl A1 ) is (Subset of Y1)))))) by A1;
consider Y1 being non  empty (Subset of X) such that A3: (Y1 is  compact & (for A1 being (Subset of X) holds (A1 = ( support u1 ) implies ( Cl A1 ) is (Subset of Y1)))) by A2;
consider v1 being (Function of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) such that A4: ((v1 = v & v1 is  continuous) & (ex Y2 being non  empty (Subset of X) st (Y2 is  compact & (for A2 being (Subset of X) holds (A2 = ( support v1 ) implies ( Cl A2 ) is (Subset of Y2)))))) by A1;
consider Y2 being non  empty (Subset of X) such that A5: (Y2 is  compact & (for A2 being (Subset of X) holds (A2 = ( support v1 ) implies ( Cl A2 ) is (Subset of Y2)))) by A4;
A6: u in ( CContinuousFunctions X ) by A2;
A7: v in ( CContinuousFunctions X ) by A4;
( CContinuousFunctions X ) is  add-closed by CC0SP1:def 2;
then ( v + u ) in ( CContinuousFunctions X ) by A6,A7,IDEAL_1:def 1;
then consider fvu being  continuous (Function of (the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) such that A8: ( v + u ) = fvu;
A9: ( Y1 \/ Y2 ) is  compact by A3,A5,COMPTS_1:10;
(( dom u1 ) = (the carrier of X) & ( dom v1 ) = (the carrier of X)) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A10: (( support u1 ) c= (the carrier of X) & ( support v1 ) c= (the carrier of X)) by PRE_POLY:37;
then reconsider A1 = ( support u1 ),A2 = ( support v1 ) as (Subset of X);
A11: ( ( dom v1 ) /\ ( dom u1 ) ) = ( (the carrier of X) /\ ( dom u1 ) ) by FUNCT_2:def 1
.= ( (the carrier of X) /\ (the carrier of X) ) by FUNCT_2:def 1
.= (the carrier of X);
( dom ( v1 + u1 ) ) = ( ( dom v1 ) /\ ( dom u1 ) ) by VALUED_1:def 1;
then A12: ( support ( v1 + u1 ) ) c= (the carrier of X) by A11,PRE_POLY:37;
reconsider A1 = ( support u1 ),A2 = ( support v1 ) as (Subset of X) by A10;
reconsider A3 = ( support ( v1 + u1 ) ) as (Subset of X) by A12;
A13: ( Cl A3 ) c= ( Cl ( A2 \/ A1 ) ) by PRE_TOPC:19,CKB60:1;
A14: ( Cl A3 ) c= ( ( Cl A2 ) \/ ( Cl A1 ) ) by A13,PRE_TOPC:20;
( Cl A1 ) is (Subset of Y1) by A3;
then A15: ( Cl A1 ) c= Y1;
( Cl A2 ) is (Subset of Y2) by A5;
then ( ( Cl A2 ) \/ ( Cl A1 ) ) c= ( Y2 \/ Y1 ) by A15,XBOOLE_1:13;
then A16: (for A3 being (Subset of X) holds (A3 = ( support ( v1 + u1 ) ) implies ( Cl A3 ) is (Subset of ( Y2 \/ Y1 )))) by XBOOLE_1:1,A14;
reconsider vv1 = v as (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) ));
reconsider uu1 = u as (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) ));
reconsider fvu1 = ( v + u ) as (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of X),( COMPLEX )) ));
A17: (for x being (Element of (the carrier of X)) holds ( fvu1 . x ) = ( ( vv1 . x ) + ( uu1 . x ) )) by CFUNCDOM:1;
A18: ( dom fvu1 ) = (the carrier of X) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
(for c being set holds (c in ( dom fvu1 ) implies ( fvu1 . c ) = ( ( v1 . c ) + ( u1 . c ) )))
proof
let c being set;
assume c in ( dom fvu1 );
then reconsider c1 = c as (Element of (the carrier of X));
thus ( fvu1 . c ) = ( ( vv1 . c1 ) + ( uu1 . c1 ) ) by A17
.= ( ( v1 . c ) + ( u1 . c ) ) by A2,A4;
end;
then fvu1 = ( v1 + u1 ) by A18,A11,VALUED_1:def 1;
hence thesis by A8,A9,A16;
