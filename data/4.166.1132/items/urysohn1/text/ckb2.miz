definition
func DYADIC -> (Subset of ( REAL ))
means
:Def4: (for a being Real holds (a in it iff (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st a in ( dyadic n ))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex i being (Element of ( NAT )) st $1 in ( dyadic i ));
(ex X being (Subset of ( REAL )) st (for x being Real holds (x in X iff P[ x ]))) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
hence thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let A1 being (Subset of ( REAL )),A2 being (Subset of ( REAL ));
assume that
A1: (for x being Real holds (x in A1 iff (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st x in ( dyadic n ))))
and
A2: (for x being Real holds (x in A2 iff (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st x in ( dyadic n ))));
(for a being set holds (a in A1 iff a in A2))
proof
let a being set;
thus (a in A1 implies a in A2)
proof
assume A3: a in A1;
then reconsider a as Real;
(ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st a in ( dyadic n )) by A1,A3;
hence thesis by A2;
end;

thus (a in A2 implies a in A1)
proof
assume A4: a in A2;
then reconsider a as Real;
(ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st a in ( dyadic n )) by A2,A4;
hence thesis by A1;
end;

end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
