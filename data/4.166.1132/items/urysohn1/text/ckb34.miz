theorem
(for T being non empty TopSpace holds ((T is  normal & T is  T_1) implies (for A being  open (Subset of T) holds (A <> ( {} ) implies (ex B being (Subset of T) st (B <> ( {} ) & ( Cl B ) c= A))))))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
assume that
A1: T is  normal
and
A2: T is  T_1;
let A being  open (Subset of T);
assume A3: A <> ( {} );
now
per cases ;
case A4: A <> ( [#] T );
A5: ( ( [#] T ) \ A ) <> ( {} )
proof
assume ( ( [#] T ) \ A ) = ( {} );
then A = ( ( [#] T ) \ ( {} ) ) by PRE_TOPC:3;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
reconsider V = ( ( [#] T ) \ A ) as (Subset of T);
consider x being set such that A6: x in A by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 1;
A = ( ( [#] T ) \ V ) by PRE_TOPC:3;
then A7: V is  closed by PRE_TOPC:def 3;
reconsider x as (Point of T) by A6;
consider W being set such that A8: W = { x };
reconsider W as (Subset of T) by A8;
A9: W misses V
proof
assume W meets V;
then consider z being set such that A10: z in ( W /\ V ) by XBOOLE_0:4;
z in W by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A11: z in A by A6,A8,TARSKI:def 1;
z in V by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
W is  closed by A2,A8,CKB31:1;
then consider B being (Subset of T),Q being (Subset of T) such that B is  open and A12: Q is  open and A13: W c= B and A14: V c= Q and A15: B misses Q by A1,A8,A7,A5,A9,COMPTS_1:def 3;
take B;
(B <> ( {} ) & ( Cl B ) c= A)
proof
B c= ( Q ` ) by A15,SUBSET_1:23;
then ( Cl B ) c= ( Q ` ) by A12,TOPS_1:5;
then ( Cl B ) misses Q by SUBSET_1:23;
then A16: V misses ( Cl B ) by A14,XBOOLE_1:63;
( ( A ` ) ` ) = A;
hence thesis by A8,A13,A16,SUBSET_1:23;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
case A17: A = ( [#] T );
consider B being (Subset of T) such that A18: B = ( [#] T );
take B;
( Cl B ) c= A by A17;
hence thesis by A18;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
