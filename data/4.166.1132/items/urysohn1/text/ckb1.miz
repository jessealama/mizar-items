definition
let n being Nat;
func dyadic n -> (Subset of ( REAL )) means 
:Def3: (for x being Real holds (x in it iff (ex i being (Element of ( NAT )) st (i <= ( 2 |^ n ) & x = ( i / ( 2 |^ n ) )))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex i being (Element of ( NAT )) st (i <= ( 2 |^ n ) & $1 = ( i / ( 2 |^ n ) )));
(ex X being (Subset of ( REAL )) st (for x being Real holds (x in X iff P[ x ]))) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
hence thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let A1 being (Subset of ( REAL ));
let A2 being (Subset of ( REAL ));
assume that
A1: (for x being Real holds (x in A1 iff (ex i being (Element of ( NAT )) st (i <= ( 2 |^ n ) & x = ( i / ( 2 |^ n ) )))))
and
A2: (for x being Real holds (x in A2 iff (ex i being (Element of ( NAT )) st (i <= ( 2 |^ n ) & x = ( i / ( 2 |^ n ) )))));
(for a being set holds (a in A1 iff a in A2))
proof
let a being set;
thus (a in A1 implies a in A2)
proof
assume A3: a in A1;
then reconsider a as Real;
(ex i being (Element of ( NAT )) st (i <= ( 2 |^ n ) & a = ( i / ( 2 |^ n ) ))) by A1,A3;
hence thesis by A2;
end;

assume A4: a in A2;
then reconsider a as Real;
(ex i being (Element of ( NAT )) st (i <= ( 2 |^ n ) & a = ( i / ( 2 |^ n ) ))) by A2,A4;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
