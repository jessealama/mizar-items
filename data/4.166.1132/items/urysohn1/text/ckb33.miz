theorem
(for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (T is  regular iff (for A being  open (Subset of T) holds (for p being (Point of T) holds (p in A implies (ex B being  open (Subset of T) st (p in B & ( Cl B ) c= A)))))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
thus (T is  regular implies (for A being  open (Subset of T) holds (for p being (Point of T) holds (p in A implies (ex B being  open (Subset of T) st (p in B & ( Cl B ) c= A))))))
proof
assume A1: T is  regular;
thus (for A being  open (Subset of T) holds (for p being (Point of T) holds (p in A implies (ex B being  open (Subset of T) st (p in B & ( Cl B ) c= A)))))
proof
let A being  open (Subset of T);
let p being (Point of T);
assume A2: p in A;
then A3: p in ( ( A ` ) ` );
thus (ex B being  open (Subset of T) st (p in B & ( Cl B ) c= A))
proof
reconsider P = ( A ` ) as (Subset of T);
now
per cases ;
case P <> ( {} );
then consider W,V being (Subset of T) such that A4: W is  open and A5: V is  open and A6: p in W and A7: P c= V and A8: W misses V by A1,A3,COMPTS_1:def 2;
( W /\ V ) = ( {} ) by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then ( V /\ ( Cl W ) ) c= ( Cl ( {} T ) ) by A5,TOPS_1:13;
then ( V /\ ( Cl W ) ) c= ( {} ) by PRE_TOPC:22;
then ( V /\ ( Cl W ) ) = ( {} );
then V misses ( Cl W ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A9: P misses ( Cl W ) by A7,XBOOLE_1:63;
take W;
( ( A ` ) ` ) = A;
then ( Cl W ) c= A by A9,SUBSET_1:23;
hence thesis by A4,A6;
end;
case A10: P = ( {} );
take A;
A = ( [#] T ) by A10,PRE_TOPC:4;
then ( Cl A ) c= A;
hence thesis by A2;

hence thesis;

assume A11: (for A being  open (Subset of T) holds (for p being (Point of T) holds (p in A implies (ex B being  open (Subset of T) st (p in B & ( Cl B ) c= A)))));
(for p being (Point of T) holds (for P being (Subset of T) holds (((P <> ( {} ) & P is  closed) & p in ( P ` )) implies (ex W,V being (Subset of T) st ((((W is  open & V is  open) & p in W) & P c= V) & W misses V)))))
proof
let p being (Point of T);
let P being (Subset of T);
assume that
P <> ( {} )
and
A12: (P is  closed & p in ( P ` ));
thus (ex W,V being (Subset of T) st ((((W is  open & V is  open) & p in W) & P c= V) & W misses V))
proof
consider A being (Subset of T) such that A13: A = ( P ` );

consider C being (Subset of T) such that A15: C = ( ( [#] T ) \ ( Cl B ) );
reconsider B,C as (Subset of T);
( Cl B ) misses C by A15,XBOOLE_1:79;
then A16: B misses C by PRE_TOPC:18,XBOOLE_1:63;
take B;

(( ( Cl B ) ` ) is  open & ( ( P ` ) ` ) = P);
hence thesis by A13,A14,A15,A16,XBOOLE_1:34;
