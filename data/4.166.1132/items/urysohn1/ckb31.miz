theorem
Th27: (for T being non empty TopSpace holds (T is  T_1 iff (for p being (Point of T) holds { p } is  closed)))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
thus (T is  T_1 implies (for p being (Point of T) holds { p } is  closed))
proof
assume A1: T is  T_1;
(for p being (Point of T) holds { p } is  closed)
proof
let p being (Point of T);
consider B being (Subset of T) such that A2: B = ( { p } ` );
defpred Q[ (Subset of T) ]
 means
(ex q being (Point of T) st (q in B & (for V being (Subset of T) holds ($1 = V implies ((V is  open & q in V) & (not p in V))))));

(ex q being (Point of T) st (q in B & (for V being (Subset of T) holds (C = V implies ((V is  open & q in V) & (not p in V))))))
proof
consider q being (Point of T) such that A7: (((q in B & C is  open) & q in C) & (not p in C)) by A6;
take q;
thus thesis by A7;

hence thesis by A3;

proof
