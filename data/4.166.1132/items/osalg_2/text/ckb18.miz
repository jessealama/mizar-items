definition
let S1;
let M being (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of S1));
func OSCl M -> (OrderSortedSet of S1) means 
:Def4: (for s being (SortSymbol of S1) holds ( it . s ) = ( union { ( M . s1 ): s1 <= s } ));
existence
proof
deffunc F((Element of S1)) = ( union { ( M . s1 ): s1 <= $1 } );
consider f being Function such that A1: (( dom f ) = (the carrier of S1) & (for d being (Element of S1) holds ( f . d ) = F(d))) from FUNCT_1:sch 4;
reconsider f as (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of S1)) by A1,PARTFUN1:def 2,RELAT_1:def 18;
reconsider f1 = f as (ManySortedSet of S1);
f1 is  order-sorted
proof
let r1 being (Element of S1);
let r2 being (Element of S1);
assume A2: r1 <= r2;
let x being set;
assume x in ( f1 . r1 );
then x in ( union { ( M . s2 ): s2 <= r1 } ) by A1;
then consider y being set such that A3: (x in y & y in { ( M . s2 ): s2 <= r1 }) by TARSKI:def 4;
consider s3 such that A4: y = ( M . s3 ) and A5: s3 <= r1 by A3;
s3 <= r2 by A2,A5,ORDERS_2:3;
then y in { ( M . s2 ): s2 <= r2 } by A4;
then x in ( union { ( M . s2 ): s2 <= r2 } ) by A3,TARSKI:def 4;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
then reconsider f2 = f1 as (OrderSortedSet of S1);
take f2;
thus thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let W1 being (OrderSortedSet of S1);
let W2 being (OrderSortedSet of S1);
assume A6: (for s being (SortSymbol of S1) holds ( W1 . s ) = ( union { ( M . s1 ): s1 <= s } ));
assume A7: (for s being (SortSymbol of S1) holds ( W2 . s ) = ( union { ( M . s1 ): s1 <= s } ));
(for s being set holds (s in (the carrier of S1) implies ( W1 . s ) = ( W2 . s )))
proof
let s being set;
assume s in (the carrier of S1);
then reconsider t = s as (SortSymbol of S1);
( W1 . s ) = ( union { ( M . s1 ): s1 <= t } ) by A6
.= ( W2 . s ) by A7;
hence thesis;

hence thesis by PBOOLE:3;
