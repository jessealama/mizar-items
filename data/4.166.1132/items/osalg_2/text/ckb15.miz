theorem
Th5: (for S being OrderSortedSign holds (for U0 being (OSAlgebra of S) holds (for U1 being MSAlgebra over S holds (U1 is (OSSubAlgebra of U0) iff ((the Sorts of U1) is (OSSubset of U0) & (for B being (OSSubset of U0) holds (B = (the Sorts of U1) implies (B is  opers_closed & (the Charact of U1) = ( Opers (U0,B) )))))))))
proof
let S being OrderSortedSign;
let U0 being (OSAlgebra of S);
let U1 being MSAlgebra over S;
hereby
assume A1: U1 is (OSSubAlgebra of U0);
then ((the Sorts of U1) is (OrderSortedSet of S) & (the Sorts of U1) is (MSSubset of U0)) by MSUALG_2:def 9,OSALG_1:17;
hence (the Sorts of U1) is (OSSubset of U0) by CKB5:def 1;
let B being (OSSubset of U0);
assume B = (the Sorts of U1);
hence (B is  opers_closed & (the Charact of U1) = ( Opers (U0,B) )) by A1,MSUALG_2:def 9;
end;
assume A2: (the Sorts of U1) is (OSSubset of U0);
assume A3: (for B being (OSSubset of U0) holds (B = (the Sorts of U1) implies (B is  opers_closed & (the Charact of U1) = ( Opers (U0,B) ))));
A4: U1 is (MSSubAlgebra of U0)
proof
thus (the Sorts of U1) is (MSSubset of U0) by A2;
let B being (MSSubset of U0);
assume that
A5: B = (the Sorts of U1);
reconsider B1 = B as (OSSubset of U0) by A2,A5;
B1 is  opers_closed by A3,A5;
hence thesis by A3,A5;
end;
(the Sorts of U1) is (OrderSortedSet of S) by A2,CKB5:def 1;
hence thesis by A4,OSALG_1:17;
end;
