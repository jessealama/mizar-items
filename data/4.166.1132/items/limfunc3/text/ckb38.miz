then ( abs ( ( ( f /* ( s * G ) ) . l ) - GR ) ) < r by A119;
then ( abs ( ( f . ( ( s * G ) . l ) ) - GR ) ) < r by A86,FUNCT_2:108,XBOOLE_1:1;
then ( abs ( ( f . ( s . k ) ) - GR ) ) < r by A123,FUNCT_2:15;
hence ( abs ( ( ( f /* s ) . k ) - GR ) ) < r by A7,FUNCT_2:108,XBOOLE_1:1;

end;
hence ( abs ( ( ( f /* s ) . k ) - GR ) ) < r;
end;
hence ( f /* s ) is  convergent by SEQ_2:def 6;
hence ( lim ( f /* s ) ) = ( lim_left (f,x0) ) by A116,SEQ_2:def 7;

end;
hence (( f /* s ) is  convergent & ( lim ( f /* s ) ) = ( lim_left (f,x0) ));

hence (( f /* s ) is  convergent & ( lim ( f /* s ) ) = ( lim_left (f,x0) ));

now
let r1;
let r2;
assume that
A124: r1 < x0
and
A125: x0 < r2;
consider g1 such that A126: r1 < g1 and A127: g1 < x0 and A128: g1 in ( dom f ) by A1,A124,LIMFUNC2:def 1;
consider g2 such that A129: g2 < r2 and A130: x0 < g2 and A131: g2 in ( dom f ) by A2,A125,LIMFUNC2:def 4;
take g1;
take g2;
thus (((((r1 < g1 & g1 < x0) & g1 in ( dom f )) & g2 < r2) & x0 < g2) & g2 in ( dom f )) by A126,A127,A128,A129,A130,A131;

hence f is_convergent_in x0 by A4,CKB13:def 1;
hence thesis by A3,A4,CKB35:def 1;
