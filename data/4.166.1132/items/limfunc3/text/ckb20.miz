then consider l being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A122: k = ( G . l ) by A93;
( G . n2 ) <= n by XXREAL_0:25;
then ( G . n2 ) <= k by A119,XXREAL_0:2;
then l >= n2 by A122,SEQM_3:1;
then ( ( f /* ( s * G ) ) . l ) < r by A118;
then ( f . ( ( s * G ) . l ) ) < r by A92,FUNCT_2:108,XBOOLE_1:1;
then ( f . ( s . k ) ) < r by A122,FUNCT_2:15;
hence ( ( f /* s ) . k ) < r by A16,FUNCT_2:108,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
end;
hence ( ( f /* s ) . k ) < r;
end;
hence ( f /* s ) is  divergent_to-infty by LIMFUNC1:def 5;
end;
end;
hence ( f /* s ) is  divergent_to-infty;
end;
end;
hence ( f /* s ) is  divergent_to-infty;

now
let r1;
let r2;
assume that
A123: r1 < x0
and
A124: x0 < r2;
consider g1 such that A125: r1 < g1 and A126: g1 < x0 and A127: g1 in ( dom f ) by A11,A123,LIMFUNC2:def 3;
consider g2 such that A128: g2 < r2 and A129: x0 < g2 and A130: g2 in ( dom f ) by A12,A124,LIMFUNC2:def 6;
take g1;
take g2;
thus (((((r1 < g1 & g1 < x0) & g1 in ( dom f )) & g2 < r2) & x0 < g2) & g2 in ( dom f )) by A125,A126,A127,A128,A129,A130;

hence thesis by A13,CKB15:def 1;
