theorem
(for S1,S2,E being non empty Signature holds ((E is (Extension of S1) & E is (Extension of S2)) iff (S1 tolerates S2 & E is (Extension of ( S1 +* S2 )))))
proof
let S1 being non empty Signature,S2 being non empty Signature,E being non empty Signature;
set f1 = ( id (the carrier of S1) );
set g1 = ( id (the carrier' of S1) );
set f2 = ( id (the carrier of S2) );
set g2 = ( id (the carrier' of S2) );
A1: ((E is (Extension of S1) & E is (Extension of S2)) implies S1 tolerates S2)
proof
assume that
A2: S1 is (Subsignature of E)
and
A3: S2 is (Subsignature of E);
A4: (the Arity of S2) c= (the Arity of E) by A3,INSTALG1:11;
(the Arity of S1) c= (the Arity of E) by A2,INSTALG1:11;
hence (the Arity of S1) tolerates (the Arity of S2) by A4,PARTFUN1:52;
A5: (the ResultSort of S2) c= (the ResultSort of E) by A3,INSTALG1:11;
(the ResultSort of S1) c= (the ResultSort of E) by A2,INSTALG1:11;
hence thesis by A5,PARTFUN1:52;
end;
A6: (the carrier of ( S1 +* S2 )) = ( (the carrier of S1) \/ (the carrier of S2) ) by CIRCCOMB:def 2;
(the carrier of S2) c= ( (the carrier of S1) \/ (the carrier of S2) ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
then A7: f2 c= ( id ( (the carrier of S1) \/ (the carrier of S2) ) ) by FUNCT_4:3;
A8: (the carrier' of ( S1 +* S2 )) = ( (the carrier' of S1) \/ (the carrier' of S2) ) by CIRCCOMB:def 2;
(the carrier of S1) c= ( (the carrier of S1) \/ (the carrier of S2) ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
then f1 c= ( id ( (the carrier of S1) \/ (the carrier of S2) ) ) by FUNCT_4:3;
then A9: f1 tolerates f2 by A7,PARTFUN1:52;
((E is (Extension of S1) & E is (Extension of S2)) implies E is (Extension of ( S1 +* S2 )))
proof
assume that
A10: f1,g1 form_morphism_between S1,E
and
A11: f2,g2 form_morphism_between S2,E;
( f1 +* f2 ),( g1 +* g2 ) form_morphism_between ( S1 +* S2 ),E by A9,A10,A11,CKB55:1;
then ( id (the carrier of ( S1 +* S2 )) ),( g1 +* g2 ) form_morphism_between ( S1 +* S2 ),E by A6,FUNCT_4:22;
hence ( id (the carrier of ( S1 +* S2 )) ),( id (the carrier' of ( S1 +* S2 )) ) form_morphism_between ( S1 +* S2 ),E by A8,FUNCT_4:22;
end;
hence ((E is (Extension of S1) & E is (Extension of S2)) implies (S1 tolerates S2 & E is (Extension of ( S1 +* S2 )))) by A1;
assume S1 tolerates S2;
then A12: ( S1 +* S2 ) is (Extension of S1) by CKB53:1;
( S1 +* S2 ) is (Extension of S2) by CKB54:1;
hence thesis by A12,CKB52:1;
