theorem
Th65: (for S,S9 being non void Signature holds (for A being  non-empty  disjoint_valued MSAlgebra over S holds (A is MSAlgebra over S9 implies ( the ManySortedSign of S ) = ( the ManySortedSign of S9 ))))
proof
let S being non void Signature,E being non void Signature;
let A being  non-empty  disjoint_valued MSAlgebra over S;
A1: ( dom (the Sorts of A) ) = (the carrier of S) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
assume A2: A is MSAlgebra over E;
then reconsider B = A as MSAlgebra over E;
A3: (the carrier of S) = (the carrier of E) by A2,CKB71:1;
A4:now
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier' of S);
then reconsider o = x as (OperSymbol of S);
reconsider e = o as (OperSymbol of E) by A2,CKB71:1;
set p = the (Element of ( Args (o,A) ));
( Den (e,B) ) = ( (the Charact of B) . e );
then A5: ( rng ( Den (o,A) ) ) c= ( Result (e,B) ) by RELAT_1:def 19;
( ( Den (o,A) ) . p ) in ( rng ( Den (o,A) ) ) by FUNCT_2:4;
then ( Result (o,A) ) meets ( Result (e,B) ) by A5,XBOOLE_0:3;
then ( Result (o,A) ) = ( ( (the Sorts of B) * (the ResultSort of E) ) . x ) by CKB73:1
.= ( (the Sorts of B) . ( (the ResultSort of E) . e ) ) by FUNCT_2:15;
then ( (the Sorts of A) . ( (the ResultSort of E) . e ) ) = ( (the Sorts of A) . ( (the ResultSort of S) . o ) ) by FUNCT_2:15;
hence ( (the ResultSort of S) . x ) = ( (the ResultSort of E) . x ) by A3,A1,FUNCT_1:def 4;
end;
A6:now
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier' of S);
then reconsider o = x as (OperSymbol of S);
reconsider e = o as (OperSymbol of E) by A2,CKB71:1;
reconsider p = ( (the Arity of E) . e ) as (Element of ( (the carrier of E) * ));
reconsider q = ( (the Arity of S) . o ) as (Element of ( (the carrier of S) * ));
( Den (e,B) ) = ( (the Charact of B) . e );
then A7: ( dom ( Den (o,A) ) ) = ( Args (e,B) ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
( dom ( Den (o,A) ) ) = ( Args (o,A) ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( Args (o,A) ) = ( ( (the Sorts of B) # ) . p ) by A7,FUNCT_2:15
.= ( product ( (the Sorts of B) * p ) ) by FINSEQ_2:def 5;
then ( product ( (the Sorts of A) * p ) ) = ( ( (the Sorts of A) # ) . q ) by FUNCT_2:15
.= ( product ( (the Sorts of A) * q ) ) by FINSEQ_2:def 5;
then A8: ( (the Sorts of B) * p ) = ( (the Sorts of A) * q ) by PUA2MSS1:2;
A9: ( rng q ) c= (the carrier of S);
then A10: ( dom ( (the Sorts of A) * q ) ) = ( dom q ) by A1,RELAT_1:27;
A11: ( rng p ) c= (the carrier of E);
then ( dom ( (the Sorts of B) * p ) ) = ( dom p ) by A3,A1,RELAT_1:27;
hence ( (the Arity of S) . x ) = ( (the Arity of E) . x ) by A3,A1,A8,A11,A9,A10,FUNCT_1:27;
end;
A12: ( dom (the Arity of E) ) = (the carrier' of E) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A13: ( dom (the Arity of S) ) = (the carrier' of S) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A14: ( dom (the ResultSort of E) ) = (the carrier' of E) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A15: (the carrier' of S) = (the carrier' of E) by A2,CKB71:1;
( dom (the ResultSort of S) ) = (the carrier' of S) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then (the ResultSort of S) = (the ResultSort of E) by A2,A14,A4,CKB71:1,FUNCT_1:2;
hence thesis by A3,A15,A13,A12,A6,FUNCT_1:2;
