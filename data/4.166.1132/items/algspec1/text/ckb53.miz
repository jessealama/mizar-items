theorem
Th49: (for S1,S2 being non empty Signature holds (S1 tolerates S2 implies ( S1 +* S2 ) is (Extension of S1)))
proof
let S1 being non empty Signature,S2 being non empty Signature;
assume that
A1: (the Arity of S1) tolerates (the Arity of S2)
and
A2: (the ResultSort of S1) tolerates (the ResultSort of S2);
set S = ( S1 +* S2 );
(the ResultSort of S) = ( (the ResultSort of S1) +* (the ResultSort of S2) ) by CIRCCOMB:def 2;
then A3: (the ResultSort of S1) c= (the ResultSort of S) by A2,FUNCT_4:28;
set f1 = ( id (the carrier of S1) );
set g1 = ( id (the carrier' of S1) );
thus (( dom f1 ) = (the carrier of S1) & ( dom g1 ) = (the carrier' of S1)) by RELAT_1:45;
A4: ( rng g1 ) = (the carrier' of S1) by RELAT_1:45;
( dom (the ResultSort of S1) ) = (the carrier' of S1) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then (the ResultSort of S1) = ( (the ResultSort of S) | (the carrier' of S1) ) by A3,GRFUNC_1:23;
then A5: (the ResultSort of S1) = ( (the ResultSort of S) * g1 ) by RELAT_1:65;
A6: (the carrier' of S) = ( (the carrier' of S1) \/ (the carrier' of S2) ) by CIRCCOMB:def 2;
A7: (the carrier of S) = ( (the carrier of S1) \/ (the carrier of S2) ) by CIRCCOMB:def 2;
( rng f1 ) = (the carrier of S1) by RELAT_1:45;
hence (( rng f1 ) c= (the carrier of S) & ( rng g1 ) c= (the carrier' of S)) by A4,A7,A6,XBOOLE_1:7;
( rng (the ResultSort of S1) ) c= (the carrier of S1);
hence ( f1 * (the ResultSort of S1) ) = ( (the ResultSort of S) * g1 ) by A5,RELAT_1:53;
let o being set;
let p being Function;
assume that
A8: o in (the carrier' of S1)
and
A9: p = ( (the Arity of S1) . o );
A10: ( dom (the Arity of S1) ) = (the carrier' of S1) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then p in ( rng (the Arity of S1) ) by A8,A9,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then p is (FinSequence of (the carrier of S1)) by FINSEQ_1:def 11;
then ( rng p ) c= (the carrier of S1) by FINSEQ_1:def 4;
hence ( f1 * p ) = p by RELAT_1:53
.= ( ( (the Arity of S1) +* (the Arity of S2) ) . o ) by A1,A8,A9,A10,FUNCT_4:15
.= ( (the Arity of S) . o ) by CIRCCOMB:def 2
.= ( (the Arity of S) . ( g1 . o ) ) by A8,FUNCT_1:18;
end;
