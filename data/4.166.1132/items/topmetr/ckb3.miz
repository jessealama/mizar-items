theorem
Th4: (for T being TopSpace holds (for A,B being (SubSpace of T) holds ((the carrier of A) c= (the carrier of B) implies A is (SubSpace of B))))
proof
let T being TopSpace;
let A being (SubSpace of T),B being (SubSpace of T);
assume A1: (the carrier of A) c= (the carrier of B);
A2: (for P being (Subset of A) holds (P in (the topology of A) iff (ex Q being (Subset of B) st (Q in (the topology of B) & P = ( Q /\ ( [#] A ) )))))
proof
let P being (Subset of A);
thus (P in (the topology of A) implies (ex Q being (Subset of B) st (Q in (the topology of B) & P = ( Q /\ ( [#] A ) ))))
proof
assume P in (the topology of A);
then consider Q9 being (Subset of T) such that A3: Q9 in (the topology of T) and A4: P = ( Q9 /\ ( [#] A ) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 4;
reconsider Q = ( Q9 /\ ( [#] B ) ) as (Subset of B);
A5: Q in (the topology of B) by A3,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
P = ( Q9 /\ ( ( [#] B ) /\ ( [#] A ) ) ) by A1,A4,XBOOLE_1:28
.= ( Q /\ ( [#] A ) ) by XBOOLE_1:16;
hence thesis by A5;
end;

given Q being (Subset of B) such that
A6: Q in (the topology of B)
and
A7: P = ( Q /\ ( [#] A ) );

consider P9 being (Subset of T) such that A8: P9 in (the topology of T) and A9: Q = ( P9 /\ ( [#] B ) ) by A6,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
P = ( P9 /\ ( ( [#] B ) /\ ( [#] A ) ) ) by A7,A9,XBOOLE_1:16
.= ( P9 /\ ( [#] A ) ) by A1,XBOOLE_1:28;
hence thesis by A8,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
end;
(the carrier of A) c= ( [#] B ) by A1;
hence thesis by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
