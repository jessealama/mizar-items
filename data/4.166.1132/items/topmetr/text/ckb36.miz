theorem
(for f being (Function of ( R^1 ),( R^1 )) holds ((ex a,b being Real st (for x being Real holds ( f . x ) = ( ( a * x ) + b ))) implies f is  continuous))
proof
let f being (Function of ( R^1 ),( R^1 ));
given a being Real,b being Real such that
A1: (for x being Real holds ( f . x ) = ( ( a * x ) + b ));

(for W being (Point of ( R^1 )) holds (for G being (a_neighborhood of ( f . W )) holds (ex H being (a_neighborhood of W) st ( f .: H ) c= G)))
proof
let W being (Point of ( R^1 ));
let G being (a_neighborhood of ( f . W ));
reconsider Y = ( f . W ) as (Point of ( RealSpace ));

(for y being set holds (y in { b } iff (ex x being set st ((x in ( dom f ) & x in H) & y = ( f . x )))))
proof
let y being set;
thus (y in { b } implies (ex x being set st ((x in ( dom f ) & x in H) & y = ( f . x ))))
proof
assume A9: y in { b };
take ( 0 );
( dom f ) = (the carrier of ( R^1 )) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence (( 0 ) in ( dom f ) & ( 0 ) in H);
