theorem
Th13: (for r being  real number holds (for M being MetrSpace holds (for A being (SubSpace of M) holds (for x being (Point of M) holds (for x9 being (Point of A) holds (x = x9 implies ( Ball (x9,r) ) = ( ( Ball (x,r) ) /\ (the carrier of A) )))))))
proof
let r being  real number;
let M being MetrSpace;
let A being (SubSpace of M);
let x being (Point of M);
let x9 being (Point of A);
assume A1: x = x9;
now
let a being set;
assume A2: a in ( Ball (x9,r) );
then reconsider y9 = a as (Point of A);
(the carrier of A) c= (the carrier of M) by CKB9:def 1;
then A3: M is non  empty by A2;
A is non  empty by A2;
then reconsider y = y9 as (Point of M) by A3,CKB12:1;
( dist (x9,y9) ) < r by A2,METRIC_1:11;
then ( (the distance of A) . (x9,y9) ) < r;
then ( (the distance of M) . (x,y) ) < r by A1,CKB9:def 1;
then ( dist (x,y) ) < r;
then a in ( Ball (x,r) ) by A3,METRIC_1:11;
hence a in ( ( Ball (x,r) ) /\ (the carrier of A) ) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
then A4: ( Ball (x9,r) ) c= ( ( Ball (x,r) ) /\ (the carrier of A) ) by TARSKI:def 3;
now
let a being set;
assume A5: a in ( ( Ball (x,r) ) /\ (the carrier of A) );
then reconsider y9 = a as (Point of A) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
reconsider y = y9 as (Point of M) by A5;
a in ( Ball (x,r) ) by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then ( dist (x,y) ) < r by METRIC_1:11;
then ( (the distance of M) . (x,y) ) < r;
then ( (the distance of A) . (x9,y9) ) < r by A1,CKB9:def 1;
then A6: ( dist (x9,y9) ) < r;
(the carrier of A) is non  empty by A5;
then A is non  empty;
hence a in ( Ball (x9,r) ) by A6,METRIC_1:11;
end;
then ( ( Ball (x,r) ) /\ (the carrier of A) ) c= ( Ball (x9,r) ) by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
