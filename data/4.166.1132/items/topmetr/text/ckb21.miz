theorem
Th19: ( TopSpaceMetr A ) is (SubSpace of ( TopSpaceMetr M ))
proof
set T = ( TopSpaceMetr M );
set R = ( TopSpaceMetr A );
thus ( [#] R ) c= ( [#] T ) by CKB9:def 1;
let P being (Subset of R);
thus (P in (the topology of R) implies (ex Q being (Subset of T) st (Q in (the topology of T) & P = ( Q /\ ( [#] R ) ))))
proof
set QQ = { ( Ball (x,r) ) where x is (Point of M),r is Real: ((x in P & r > ( 0 )) & ( ( Ball (x,r) ) /\ (the carrier of A) ) c= P) };
(for X being set holds (X in QQ implies X c= (the carrier of M)))
proof
let X being set;
assume X in QQ;
then (ex x being (Point of M) st (ex r being Real st (((X = ( Ball (x,r) ) & x in P) & r > ( 0 )) & ( ( Ball (x,r) ) /\ (the carrier of A) ) c= P)));
hence thesis;
