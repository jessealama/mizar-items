let Y being TopStruct;
redefine mode SubSpace of Y
means :Def1: ((the carrier of it) c= (the carrier of Y) & (for G0 being (Subset of it) holds (G0 is  open iff (ex G being (Subset of Y) st (G is  open & G0 = ( G /\ (the carrier of it) ))))));
compatibility
proof
let Y0 being TopStruct;
A1: (( [#] Y0 ) = (the carrier of Y0) & ( [#] Y ) = (the carrier of Y));
thus (Y0 is (SubSpace of Y) implies ((the carrier of Y0) c= (the carrier of Y) & (for G0 being (Subset of Y0) holds (G0 is  open iff (ex G being (Subset of Y) st (G is  open & G0 = ( G /\ (the carrier of Y0) )))))))
proof
assume A2: Y0 is (SubSpace of Y);
hence (the carrier of Y0) c= (the carrier of Y) by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
thus (for G0 being (Subset of Y0) holds (G0 is  open iff (ex G being (Subset of Y) st (G is  open & G0 = ( G /\ (the carrier of Y0) )))))
proof
let G0 being (Subset of Y0);
thus (G0 is  open implies (ex G being (Subset of Y) st (G is  open & G0 = ( G /\ (the carrier of Y0) ))))
proof
assume G0 is  open;
then G0 in (the topology of Y0) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then consider G being (Subset of Y) such that A3: G in (the topology of Y) and A4: G0 = ( G /\ ( [#] Y0 ) ) by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
reconsider G as (Subset of Y);
take G;
thus G is  open by A3,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
thus thesis by A4;

given G being (Subset of Y) such that
A5: G is  open
and
A6: G0 = ( G /\ (the carrier of Y0) );

now
take G;
thus G in (the topology of Y) by A5,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
thus G0 = ( G /\ ( [#] Y0 ) ) by A6;
end;
then G0 in (the topology of Y0) by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
hence thesis by PRE_TOPC:def 2;

proof
reconsider M = G0 as (Subset of Y0);
assume G0 in (the topology of Y0);
then M is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 2;

take G;
thus G in (the topology of Y) by A10,PRE_TOPC:def 2;

end;

given G being (Subset of Y) such that
A12: G in (the topology of Y)

thus G is  open by A12,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
