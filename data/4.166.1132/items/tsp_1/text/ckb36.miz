reserve Y for non  empty TopStruct;
theorem
(for A being non  empty (Subset of Y) holds ((A is  anti-discrete & (not A is  trivial)) implies (not A is  T_0)))
proof
let A being non  empty (Subset of Y);
assume A1: A is  anti-discrete;
consider s being set such that A2: s in A by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
reconsider s0 = s as (Element of A) by A2;
assume (not A is  trivial);
then A <> { s0 };
then consider t being set such that A3: t in A and A4: t <> s0 by ZFMISC_1:35;
reconsider s,t as (Point of Y) by A2,A3;
assume A5: A is  T_0;
now
per cases  by A3,A4,A5,CKB28:def 1;
suppose (ex E being (Subset of Y) st ((E is  closed & s in E) & (not t in E)));

then consider E being (Subset of Y) such that A6: (E is  closed & s in E) and A7: (not t in E);
A c= E by A1,A2,A6,TEX_4:def 2;
hence contradiction by A3,A7;
end;
suppose (ex F being (Subset of Y) st ((F is  closed & (not s in F)) & t in F));

then consider F being (Subset of Y) such that A8: F is  closed and A9: (not s in F) and A10: t in F;
A c= F by A1,A3,A8,A10,TEX_4:def 2;
hence contradiction by A2,A9;
end;
end;
hence contradiction;
