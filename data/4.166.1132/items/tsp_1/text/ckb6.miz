thus (Y is  T_0 implies (Y is  empty or (for x,y being (Point of Y) holds (x <> y implies ((ex E being (Subset of Y) st ((E is  closed & x in E) & (not y in E))) or (ex F being (Subset of Y) st ((F is  closed & (not x in F)) & y in F)))))))

then consider V being (Subset of Y) such that A4: V is  open and A5: x in V and A6: (not y in V);
now
