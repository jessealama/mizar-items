theorem
Th10: (for A,B being (Subset of Y) holds ((A is  closed or B is  closed) implies ((A is  T_0 & B is  T_0) implies ( A \/ B ) is  T_0)))
proof
let A being (Subset of Y);
let B being (Subset of Y);
assume A1: (A is  closed or B is  closed);
assume that
A2: A is  T_0
and
A3: B is  T_0;
now
let x being (Point of Y);
let y being (Point of Y);
assume A4: (x in ( A \/ B ) & y in ( A \/ B ));
then A5: (x in ( ( A \ B ) \/ B ) & y in ( ( A \ B ) \/ B )) by XBOOLE_1:39;
assume A6: x <> y;
A7: (x in ( A \/ ( B \ A ) ) & y in ( A \/ ( B \ A ) )) by A4,XBOOLE_1:39;
now
per cases  by A1;
suppose A8: A is  closed;

now
per cases  by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose (x in A & y in A);

hence ((ex V being (Subset of Y) st ((V is  closed & x in V) & (not y in V))) or (ex W being (Subset of Y) st ((W is  closed & (not x in W)) & y in W))) by A2,A6,CKB28:def 1;
end;
suppose A9: (x in A & y in ( B \ A ));

now
take A;
thus A is  closed by A8;
thus x in A by A9;
thus (not y in A) by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
hence ((ex V being (Subset of Y) st ((V is  closed & x in V) & (not y in V))) or (ex W being (Subset of Y) st ((W is  closed & (not x in W)) & y in W)));
end;
suppose A10: (x in ( B \ A ) & y in A);

now
take A;
thus A is  closed by A8;
thus (not x in A) by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
thus y in A by A10;
end;
hence ((ex V being (Subset of Y) st ((V is  closed & x in V) & (not y in V))) or (ex W being (Subset of Y) st ((W is  closed & (not x in W)) & y in W)));
end;
suppose A11: (x in ( B \ A ) & y in ( B \ A ));

( B \ A ) c= B by XBOOLE_1:36;

end;
suppose A14: (x in ( A \ B ) & y in B);

now
take B;
thus B is  closed by A12;
thus (not x in B) by A14,XBOOLE_0:def 5;

now
take B;
thus B is  closed by A12;
thus x in B by A15;
