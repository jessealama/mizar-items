let Y being TopStruct;
redefine mode SubSpace of Y
means :Def2: ((the carrier of it) c= (the carrier of Y) & (for F0 being (Subset of it) holds (F0 is  closed iff (ex F being (Subset of Y) st (F is  closed & F0 = ( F /\ (the carrier of it) ))))));
compatibility
proof
let Y0 being TopStruct;
A1: (( [#] Y0 ) = (the carrier of Y0) & ( [#] Y ) = (the carrier of Y));
thus (Y0 is (SubSpace of Y) implies ((the carrier of Y0) c= (the carrier of Y) & (for F0 being (Subset of Y0) holds (F0 is  closed iff (ex F being (Subset of Y) st (F is  closed & F0 = ( F /\ (the carrier of Y0) )))))))
proof
assume A2: Y0 is (SubSpace of Y);
hence (the carrier of Y0) c= (the carrier of Y) by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
( [#] Y0 ) c= ( [#] Y ) by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
then A3: ( ( [#] Y0 ) \ ( [#] Y ) ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_1:37;
thus (for F0 being (Subset of Y0) holds (F0 is  closed iff (ex F being (Subset of Y) st (F is  closed & F0 = ( F /\ (the carrier of Y0) )))))
proof
let F0 being (Subset of Y0);
set G0 = ( ( [#] Y0 ) \ F0 );
thus (F0 is  closed implies (ex F being (Subset of Y) st (F is  closed & F0 = ( F /\ (the carrier of Y0) ))))
proof
assume F0 is  closed;
then ( ( [#] Y0 ) \ F0 ) is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 3;
then consider G being (Subset of Y) such that A4: G is  open and A5: ( ( [#] Y0 ) \ F0 ) = ( G /\ (the carrier of Y0) ) by A2,CKB1:def 1;
take F = ( ( [#] Y ) \ G );
A6: G = ( ( [#] Y ) \ F ) by PRE_TOPC:3;
hence F is  closed by A4,PRE_TOPC:def 3;
F0 = ( ( [#] Y0 ) \ ( G /\ (the carrier of Y0) ) ) by A5,PRE_TOPC:3
