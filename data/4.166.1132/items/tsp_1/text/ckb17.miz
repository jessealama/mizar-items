definition
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
redefine attr X is  T_0
means
:Def5: (for x,y being (Point of X) holds (x <> y implies ( Cl { x } ) <> ( Cl { y } )));
compatibility
proof
thus (X is  T_0 implies (for x,y being (Point of X) holds (x <> y implies ( Cl { x } ) <> ( Cl { y } ))))
proof
assume A1: X is  T_0;
hereby
let x being (Point of X);
let y being (Point of X);
assume A2: x <> y;
now
per cases  by A1,A2,CKB5:def 1;
suppose (ex V being (Subset of X) st ((V is  open & x in V) & (not y in V)));

then consider V being (Subset of X) such that A3: V is  open and A4: x in V and A5: (not y in V);
(x in { x } & { x } c= ( Cl { x } )) by PRE_TOPC:18,TARSKI:def 1;
then A6: ( ( Cl { x } ) /\ V ) <> ( {} ) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
y in ( V ` ) by A5,SUBSET_1:29;
then { y } c= ( V ` ) by ZFMISC_1:31;
then { y } misses V by SUBSET_1:23;
then A7: ( Cl { y } ) misses V by A3,TSEP_1:36;
assume ( Cl { x } ) = ( Cl { y } );
hence contradiction by A7,A6,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
end;
suppose (ex W being (Subset of X) st ((W is  open & (not x in W)) & y in W));

then consider W being (Subset of X) such that A8: W is  open and A9: (not x in W) and A10: y in W;
(y in { y } & { y } c= ( Cl { y } )) by PRE_TOPC:18,TARSKI:def 1;
then A11: ( ( Cl { y } ) /\ W ) <> ( {} ) by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
x in ( W ` ) by A9,SUBSET_1:29;
then { x } c= ( W ` ) by ZFMISC_1:31;
then { x } misses W by SUBSET_1:23;
then A12: ( Cl { x } ) misses W by A8,TSEP_1:36;
assume ( Cl { x } ) = ( Cl { y } );
hence contradiction by A12,A11,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
end;
end;
hence ( Cl { x } ) <> ( Cl { y } );
end;
end;

assume A13: (for x,y being (Point of X) holds (x <> y implies ( Cl { x } ) <> ( Cl { y } )));
now
let x being (Point of X);
let y being (Point of X);
assume A14: x <> y;
assume A15: (for E being (Subset of X) holds ((E is  closed & x in E) implies y in E));
thus (ex F being (Subset of X) st ((F is  closed & (not x in F)) & y in F))
proof
set F = ( Cl { y } );
take F;
thus F is  closed;
now
assume x in F;
then { x } c= F by ZFMISC_1:31;
then A16: ( Cl { x } ) c= F by TOPS_1:5;
y in ( Cl { x } ) by A15,CKB16:1;
then { y } c= ( Cl { x } ) by ZFMISC_1:31;
then F c= ( Cl { x } ) by TOPS_1:5;
then ( Cl { x } ) = F by A16,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence contradiction by A13,A14;
end;
hence (not x in F);
thus thesis by CKB16:1;
end;

end;
hence thesis by CKB6:def 1;
end;
end;
