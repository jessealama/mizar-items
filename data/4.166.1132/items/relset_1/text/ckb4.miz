definition

let R;
let Z;
redefine pred R c= Z
means
(for x being (Element of X) holds (for y being (Element of Y) holds ([ x,y ] in R implies [ x,y ] in Z)))
;compatibility
proof
thus (R c= Z implies (for x being (Element of X) holds (for y being (Element of Y) holds ([ x,y ] in R implies [ x,y ] in Z))));
assume A1: (for x being (Element of X) holds (for y being (Element of Y) holds ([ x,y ] in R implies [ x,y ] in Z)));
let a being set,b being set;
assume A2: [ a,b ] in R;
then reconsider a9 = a as (Element of X) by ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider b9 = b as (Element of Y) by A2,ZFMISC_1:87;
[ a9,b9 ] in Z by A1,A2;
hence thesis;
