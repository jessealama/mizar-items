reserve P for (Relation of X,Y);
reserve R for (Relation of X,Y);
definition
let X;
let Y;
let P;
let R;
redefine pred P = R
means
(for x being (Element of X) holds (for y being (Element of Y) holds ([ x,y ] in P iff [ x,y ] in R)))
;compatibility
proof
thus (P = R implies (for x being (Element of X) holds (for y being (Element of Y) holds ([ x,y ] in P iff [ x,y ] in R))));
assume A1: (for x being (Element of X) holds (for y being (Element of Y) holds ([ x,y ] in P iff [ x,y ] in R)));
let a being set,b being set;
hereby
assume A2: [ a,b ] in P;
then reconsider a9 = a as (Element of X) by ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider b9 = b as (Element of Y) by A2,ZFMISC_1:87;
[ a9,b9 ] in R by A1,A2;
hence [ a,b ] in R;
end;
assume A3: [ a,b ] in R;
then reconsider a9 = a as (Element of X) by ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider b9 = b as (Element of Y) by A3,ZFMISC_1:87;
[ a9,b9 ] in P by A1,A3;
hence thesis;
