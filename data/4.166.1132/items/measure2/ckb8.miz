theorem
Th6: (for S being non empty (Subset-Family of X) holds (for N,F being (Function of ( NAT ),S) holds ((( F . ( 0 ) ) = ( N . ( 0 ) ) & (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( F . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( N . ( n + 1 ) ) \/ ( F . n ) ))) implies (for r being set holds (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (r in ( F . n ) iff (ex k being (Element of ( NAT )) st (k <= n & r in ( N . k )))))))))
proof
let S being non empty (Subset-Family of X);
let N being (Function of ( NAT ),S),F being (Function of ( NAT ),S);
assume that
A1: ( F . ( 0 ) ) = ( N . ( 0 ) )
and
A2: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( F . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( N . ( n + 1 ) ) \/ ( F . n ) ));
let r being set;
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
defpred P[ (Element of ( NAT )) ]
 means
((ex k being (Element of ( NAT )) st (k <= $1 & r in ( N . k ))) implies r in ( F . $1 ));
A3: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (P[ n ] implies P[ ( n + 1 ) ]))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume A4: ((ex k being (Element of ( NAT )) st (k <= n & r in ( N . k ))) implies r in ( F . n ));
A5: ( F . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( N . ( n + 1 ) ) \/ ( F . n ) ) by A2;
given k being (Element of ( NAT )) such that
A6: k <= ( n + 1 )
and
A7: r in ( N . k );

(k <= n or k = ( n + 1 )) by A6,NAT_1:8;
hence thesis by A4,A7,A5,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
thus (r in ( F . n ) implies (ex k being (Element of ( NAT )) st (k <= n & r in ( N . k ))))
proof
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
r in ( F . $1 );
assume A8: r in ( F . n );
then A9: (ex n being Nat st P[ n ]);
(ex s being Nat st (P[ s ] & (for k being Nat holds (P[ k ] implies s <= k)))) from NAT_1:sch 5(A9);
then consider s being Nat such that A10: r in ( F . s ) and A11: (for k being Nat holds (r in ( F . k ) implies s <= k));
A12: ((ex k being Nat st s = ( k + 1 )) implies (ex k being (Element of ( NAT )) st (k <= n & r in ( N . k ))))
proof
given k being Nat such that
A13: s = ( k + 1 );

reconsider k as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
A14: (not r in ( F . k ))
proof
assume r in ( F . k );
then s <= k by A11;
hence thesis by A13,NAT_1:13;
end;
take s;
A15: s in ( NAT ) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
( F . s ) = ( ( N . s ) \/ ( F . k ) ) by A2,A13;
hence thesis by A8,A10,A11,A14,A15,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
(s = ( 0 ) implies (ex k being (Element of ( NAT )) st (k <= n & r in ( N . k )))) by A1,A10,NAT_1:2;
hence thesis by A12,NAT_1:6;
end;

A16: P[ ( 0 ) ] by A1,NAT_1:3;
(for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ n ]) from NAT_1:sch 1(A16,A3);
hence thesis;
