theorem
Th9: (for S being (SigmaField of X) holds (for N,G being (Function of ( NAT ),S) holds (ex F being (Function of ( NAT ),S) st (( F . ( 0 ) ) = ( N . ( 0 ) ) & (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( F . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( N . ( n + 1 ) ) \ ( G . n ) ))))))
proof
let S being (SigmaField of X);
let N being (Function of ( NAT ),S),G being (Function of ( NAT ),S);
defpred P[ set,set,set ]
 means
(for A,B being (Element of S) holds (for c being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (((c = $1 & A = $2) & B = $3) implies B = ( ( N . ( c + 1 ) ) \ ( G . c ) ))));
A1: (for c being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for A being (Element of S) holds (ex B being (Element of S) st P[ c,A,B ])))
proof
let c being (Element of ( NAT ));
let A being (Element of S);
consider B being set such that A2: B = ( ( N . ( c + 1 ) ) \ ( G . c ) );
reconsider B as (Element of S) by A2;
take B;
thus thesis by A2;

consider F being (Function of ( NAT ),S) such that A3: (( F . ( 0 ) ) = ( N . ( 0 ) ) & (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ n,( F . n ),( F . ( n + 1 ) ) ])) from RECDEF_1:sch 2(A1);
(for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( F . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( N . ( n + 1 ) ) \ ( G . n ) ))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
(for a,b being (Element of S) holds (for s being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (((s = n & a = ( F . n )) & b = ( F . ( n + 1 ) )) implies b = ( ( N . ( s + 1 ) ) \ ( G . s ) )))) by A3;
hence thesis;

hence thesis by A3;
