theorem
(for S being (SigmaField of X) holds (for M being (sigma_Measure of S) holds (for T being (N_Measure_fam of S) holds ((for A being set holds (A in T implies A is (measure_zero of M))) implies ( union T ) is (measure_zero of M)))))
proof
let S being (SigmaField of X);
let M being (sigma_Measure of S);
let T being (N_Measure_fam of S);
consider F being (Function of ( NAT ),S) such that A1: T = ( rng F ) by CKB15:1;
set G = ( M * F );
assume A2: (for A being set holds (A in T implies A is (measure_zero of M)));
A3: (for r being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (( 0 ) <= r implies ( G . r ) = ( 0. )))
proof
let r being (Element of ( NAT ));
( F . r ) is (measure_zero of M) by A2,A1,FUNCT_2:4;
then ( M . ( F . r ) ) = ( 0. ) by MEASURE1:def 7;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:15;
end;
G is  nonnegative by MEASURE1:25;
then ( SUM G ) = ( ( Ser G ) . ( 0 ) ) by A3,SUPINF_2:48;
then ( SUM G ) = ( G . ( 0 ) ) by SUPINF_2:44;
then ( SUM ( M * F ) ) = ( 0. ) by A3;
then A4: ( M . ( union T ) ) <= ( 0. ) by A1,CKB14:1;
( 0. ) <= ( M . ( union T ) ) by MEASURE1:def 2;
then ( M . ( union T ) ) = ( 0. ) by A4,XXREAL_0:1;
hence thesis by MEASURE1:def 7;
