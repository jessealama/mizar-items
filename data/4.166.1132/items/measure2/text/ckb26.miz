theorem
Th23: (for N,F being Function holds ((( F . ( 0 ) ) = ( N . ( 0 ) ) & (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (( F . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( N . ( n + 1 ) ) \ ( N . n ) ) & ( N . n ) c= ( N . ( n + 1 ) )))) implies (for n,m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n < m implies ( F . n ) misses ( F . m )))))
proof
let N being Function,F being Function;
assume that
A1: ( F . ( 0 ) ) = ( N . ( 0 ) )
and
A2: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (( F . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( N . ( n + 1 ) ) \ ( N . n ) ) & ( N . n ) c= ( N . ( n + 1 ) )));
let n being (Element of ( NAT )),m being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume A3: n < m;
then ( 0 ) <> m by NAT_1:2;
then consider k being Nat such that A4: m = ( k + 1 ) by NAT_1:6;
A5: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( F . n ) c= ( N . n ))
proof
defpred P[ (Element of ( NAT )) ]
 means
( F . $1 ) c= ( N . $1 );
A6: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (P[ n ] implies P[ ( n + 1 ) ]))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume ( F . n ) c= ( N . n );
( F . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( N . ( n + 1 ) ) \ ( N . n ) ) by A2;
hence thesis;
end;
A7: P[ ( 0 ) ] by A1;
thus (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ n ]) from NAT_1:sch 1(A7,A6);
end;
A8: (for n,m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n <= m implies ( F . n ) c= ( N . m )))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT )),m being (Element of ( NAT ));
A9: (n < m implies ( F . n ) c= ( N . m ))
proof
assume n < m;
then A10: ( N . n ) c= ( N . m ) by A2,CKB25:1;
( F . n ) c= ( N . n ) by A5;
hence thesis by A10,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
assume n <= m;
then (n = m or n < m) by XXREAL_0:1;
hence thesis by A5,A9;
end;
reconsider k as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
( F . ( k + 1 ) ) = ( ( N . ( k + 1 ) ) \ ( N . k ) ) by A2;
then A11: ( N . k ) misses ( F . ( k + 1 ) ) by XBOOLE_1:79;
n <= k by A3,A4,NAT_1:13;
then ( ( F . n ) /\ ( F . ( k + 1 ) ) ) = ( ( ( F . n ) /\ ( N . k ) ) /\ ( F . ( k + 1 ) ) ) by A8,XBOOLE_1:28
.= ( ( F . n ) /\ ( ( N . k ) /\ ( F . ( k + 1 ) ) ) ) by XBOOLE_1:16
.= ( ( F . n ) /\ ( {} ) ) by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 7
.= ( {} );
hence thesis by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
end;
