theorem
Th4: (for S being (SigmaField of X) holds (for N being (Function of ( NAT ),S) holds (ex F being (Function of ( NAT ),S) st (( F . ( 0 ) ) = ( N . ( 0 ) ) & (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( F . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( N . ( n + 1 ) ) \ ( N . n ) ))))))
proof
let S being (SigmaField of X);
let N being (Function of ( NAT ),S);
reconsider S as non  empty set;
defpred P[ set,set,set ]
 means
(for A,B being (Element of S) holds (for c being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (((c = $1 & A = $2) & B = $3) implies B = ( ( N . ( c + 1 ) ) \ ( N . c ) ))));
reconsider A = ( N . ( 0 ) ) as (Element of S);
A1: (for c being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for A being (Element of S) holds (ex B being (Element of S) st P[ c,A,B ])))
proof
let c being (Element of ( NAT ));
let A being (Element of S);
reconsider B = ( ( N . ( c + 1 ) ) \ ( N . c ) ) as (Element of S);
take B;
thus thesis;

consider F being (Function of ( NAT ),S) such that A2: (( F . ( 0 ) ) = A & (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ n,( F . n ),( F . ( n + 1 ) ) ])) from RECDEF_1:sch 2(A1);
(for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( F . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( N . ( n + 1 ) ) \ ( N . n ) ))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
(for a,b being (Element of S) holds (for s being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (((s = n & a = ( F . n )) & b = ( F . ( n + 1 ) )) implies b = ( ( N . ( s + 1 ) ) \ ( N . s ) )))) by A2;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by A2;
