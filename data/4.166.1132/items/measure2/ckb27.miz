theorem
Th24: (for S being (SigmaField of X) holds (for N,F being (Function of ( NAT ),S) holds ((( F . ( 0 ) ) = ( N . ( 0 ) ) & (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (( F . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( N . ( n + 1 ) ) \ ( N . n ) ) & ( N . n ) c= ( N . ( n + 1 ) )))) implies ( union ( rng F ) ) = ( union ( rng N ) ))))
proof
let S being (SigmaField of X);
let N being (Function of ( NAT ),S),F being (Function of ( NAT ),S);
assume that
A1: ( F . ( 0 ) ) = ( N . ( 0 ) )
and
A2: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (( F . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( N . ( n + 1 ) ) \ ( N . n ) ) & ( N . n ) c= ( N . ( n + 1 ) )));
thus ( union ( rng F ) ) c= ( union ( rng N ) )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( union ( rng F ) );
then consider Y being set such that A3: x in Y and A4: Y in ( rng F ) by TARSKI:def 4;
consider n being set such that A5: n in ( dom F ) and A6: Y = ( F . n ) by A4,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider n as (Element of ( NAT )) by A5;
A7: ((ex k being Nat st n = ( k + 1 )) implies (ex Z being set st (x in Z & Z in ( rng N ))))
proof
given k being Nat such that
A8: n = ( k + 1 );

reconsider k as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
Y = ( ( N . ( k + 1 ) ) \ ( N . k ) ) by A2,A6,A8;
then x in ( N . ( k + 1 ) ) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:4;
end;
(n = ( 0 ) implies (ex Z being set st (x in Z & Z in ( rng N )))) by A1,A3,A6,FUNCT_2:4;
hence thesis by A7,NAT_1:6,TARSKI:def 4;
end;

let x being set;
assume x in ( union ( rng N ) );
then consider Y being set such that A9: x in Y and A10: Y in ( rng N ) by TARSKI:def 4;
A11: (ex n being set st (n in ( dom N ) & Y = ( N . n ))) by A10,FUNCT_1:def 3;
(ex Z being set st (x in Z & Z in ( rng F )))
proof
(ex s being (Element of ( NAT )) st x in ( F . s ))
proof
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
x in ( N . $1 );
A12: (ex k being Nat st P[ k ]) by A9,A11;
(ex k being Nat st (P[ k ] & (for r being Nat holds (P[ r ] implies k <= r)))) from NAT_1:sch 5(A12);
then consider k being Nat such that A13: x in ( N . k ) and A14: (for r being Nat holds (x in ( N . r ) implies k <= r));
A15: ((ex l being Nat st k = ( l + 1 )) implies (ex s being (Element of ( NAT )) st x in ( F . s )))
proof
given l being Nat such that
A16: k = ( l + 1 );

take k;
reconsider l as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
A17: (not x in ( N . l ))
proof
assume x in ( N . l );
then ( l + 1 ) <= l by A14,A16;
hence thesis by NAT_1:13;
end;
( F . ( l + 1 ) ) = ( ( N . ( l + 1 ) ) \ ( N . l ) ) by A2;
hence thesis by A13,A16,A17,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
(k = ( 0 ) implies (ex s being (Element of ( NAT )) st x in ( F . s ))) by A1,A13;
hence thesis by A15,NAT_1:6;
end;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:4;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 4;
