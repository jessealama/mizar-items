scheme PartFuncExD9 { D,C() -> non empty set,P[set,set] } : (ex f being (PartFunc of D(),C()) st ((for d being (Element of D()) holds (d in ( dom f ) iff (ex c being (Element of C()) st P[ d,c ]))) & (for d being (Element of D()) holds (d in ( dom f ) implies P[ d,( f . d ) ]))))
proof
defpred X[ set ]
 means
(ex c being (Element of C()) st P[ $1,c ]);
set x = the (Element of C());
defpred X[ (Element of D()),(Element of C()) ]
 means
(((ex c being (Element of C()) st P[ $1,c ]) implies P[ $1,$2 ]) & ((for c being (Element of C()) holds (not P[ $1,c ])) implies $2 = x));
consider X being set such that A1: (for x holds (x in X iff (x in D() & X[ x ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
(for x holds (x in X implies x in D())) by A1;
then reconsider X as (Subset of D()) by TARSKI:def 3;
A2: (for d being (Element of D()) holds (ex z being (Element of C()) st X[ d,z ]))
proof
let d being (Element of D());
((for c being (Element of C()) holds (not P[ d,c ])) implies (ex z st (((ex c being (Element of C()) st P[ d,c ]) implies P[ d,z ]) & ((for c being (Element of C()) holds (not P[ d,c ])) implies z = x))));

consider g being (Function of D(),C()) such that A3: (for d being (Element of D()) holds X[ d,( g . d ) ]) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A2);
reconsider f = ( g | X ) as (PartFunc of D(),C());
take f;
A4: ( dom g ) = D() by FUNCT_2:def 1;
thus (for d being (Element of D()) holds (d in ( dom f ) iff (ex c being (Element of C()) st P[ d,c ])))
proof
let d being (Element of D());
( dom f ) c= X by RELAT_1:58;
hence (d in ( dom f ) implies (ex c being (Element of C()) st P[ d,c ])) by A1;
assume (ex c being (Element of C()) st P[ d,c ]);
then d in X by A1;
then d in ( ( dom g ) /\ X ) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by RELAT_1:61;
end;

let d being (Element of D());
assume A5: d in ( dom f );
( dom f ) c= X by RELAT_1:58;
then (ex c being (Element of C()) st P[ d,c ]) by A1,A5;
then P[ d,( g . d ) ] by A3;
hence thesis by A5,FUNCT_1:47;
