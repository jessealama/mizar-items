theorem
(for A being TopSpace holds (for B being non empty TopSpace holds (for f being (Function of A,B) holds (for C being (SubSpace of B) holds (f is  continuous implies (for h being (Function of A,C) holds (h = f implies h is  continuous)))))))
proof
let A being TopSpace;
let B being non empty TopSpace;
let f being (Function of A,B);
let C being (SubSpace of B);
assume A1: f is  continuous;
let h being (Function of A,C);
assume that
A2: h = f;
A3: ( rng f ) c= (the carrier of C) by A2,RELAT_1:def 19;
(for P being (Subset of C) holds (P is  closed implies ( h " P ) is  closed))
proof
let P being (Subset of C);
assume P is  closed;
then consider Q being (Subset of B) such that A4: Q is  closed and A5: ( Q /\ ( [#] C ) ) = P by CKB34:1;
( h " P ) = ( ( f " Q ) /\ ( f " ( [#] C ) ) ) by A2,A5,FUNCT_1:68
.= ( ( f " Q ) /\ ( f " ( ( rng f ) /\ ( [#] C ) ) ) ) by RELAT_1:133
.= ( ( f " Q ) /\ ( f " ( rng f ) ) ) by A3,XBOOLE_1:28
.= ( ( f " Q ) /\ ( dom f ) ) by RELAT_1:134
.= ( f " Q ) by RELAT_1:132,XBOOLE_1:28;
hence thesis by A1,A4,CKB27:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB27:def 1;
