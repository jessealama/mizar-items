theorem
Th44: (for F being (Subset-Family of GX) holds ((for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F implies A is  closed)) implies ( meet F ) is  closed))
proof
let F being (Subset-Family of GX);
assume that
A1: (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F implies A is  closed));
per cases ;
suppose A2: F <> ( {} );

defpred Q[ set ]
 means
( ( [#] GX ) \ $1 ) in F;
consider R1 being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A3: (for B being (Subset of GX) holds (B in R1 iff Q[ B ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
A4: (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of GX) implies ((for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F implies x in A)) iff (for Z being (Subset of GX) holds (Z in R1 implies (not x in Z))))))
proof
let x being set;
assume A5: x in (the carrier of GX);
thus ((for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F implies x in A)) implies (for Z being (Subset of GX) holds (Z in R1 implies (not x in Z))))
proof
assume A6: (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F implies x in A));
let Z being (Subset of GX);
assume Z in R1;
then ( ( [#] GX ) \ Z ) in F by A3;
then x in ( ( [#] GX ) \ Z ) by A6;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;

assume A7: (for Z being (Subset of GX) holds (Z in R1 implies (not x in Z)));
let A being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A8: A in F;
( ( [#] GX ) \ ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) ) = A by CKB9:1;
then ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) in R1 by A3,A8;
then (not x in ( ( [#] GX ) \ A )) by A7;
hence thesis by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
A9: (for x being set holds (x in ( ( [#] GX ) \ ( union R1 ) ) iff x in ( meet F )))
proof
let x being set;
thus (x in ( ( [#] GX ) \ ( union R1 ) ) implies x in ( meet F ))
proof
assume A10: x in ( ( [#] GX ) \ ( union R1 ) );
then (not x in ( union R1 )) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then (for Z being (Subset of GX) holds (Z in R1 implies (not x in Z))) by TARSKI:def 4;
then (for A being set holds (A in F implies x in A)) by A4,A10;
hence thesis by A2,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;

assume A11: x in ( meet F );
then (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F implies x in A)) by SETFAM_1:def 1;
then (for Z being set holds (x in Z implies (not Z in R1))) by A4;
then (not x in ( union R1 )) by TARSKI:def 4;
hence thesis by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
now
let B being set;
assume A12: B in R1;
then reconsider B1 = B as (Subset of GX);
(B1 in R1 iff ( ( [#] GX ) \ B1 ) in F) by A3;
then A13: ( ( [#] GX ) \ B1 ) is  closed by A1,A12;
( ( [#] GX ) \ ( ( [#] GX ) \ B1 ) ) = B1 by CKB9:1;
then B1 is  open by A13,CKB14:def 1;
hence B in (the topology of GX) by CKB13:def 1;
end;
then R1 c= (the topology of GX) by TARSKI:def 3;
then ( union R1 ) in (the topology of GX) by CKB2:def 1;
then A14: ( union R1 ) is  open by CKB13:def 1;
( ( [#] GX ) \ ( ( [#] GX ) \ ( union R1 ) ) ) = ( union R1 ) by CKB9:1;
then ( ( [#] GX ) \ ( union R1 ) ) is  closed by A14,CKB14:def 1;
hence thesis by A9,TARSKI:1;
end;
suppose A15: F = ( {} );

(the carrier of GX) in (the topology of GX) by CKB2:def 1;
then A16: ( [#] GX ) is  open by CKB13:def 1;
( [#] GX ) = ( ( [#] GX ) \ ( {} GX ) );
then ( {} GX ) is  closed by A16,CKB14:def 1;
hence thesis by A15,SETFAM_1:def 1;
