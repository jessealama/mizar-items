begin
reserve T for TopStruct;
definition
let T being TopStruct;
let P being (Subset of T);
func T | P ->  strict (SubSpace of T) means 
:Def10: ( [#] it ) = P;
existence
proof
defpred Q[ set ]
 means
(ex Q being (Subset of T) st (Q in (the topology of T) & $1 = ( Q /\ P )));
consider top1 being (Subset-Family of P) such that A1: (for Z being (Subset of P) holds (Z in top1 iff Q[ Z ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
reconsider top1 as (Subset-Family of P);
set Y = TopStruct (# P,top1 #);
A2: (for Z being (Subset of Y) holds (Z in top1 iff (ex Q being (Subset of T) st (Q in (the topology of T) & Z = ( Q /\ ( [#] Y ) )))))
proof
let Z being (Subset of Y);
thus (Z in top1 implies (ex Q being (Subset of T) st (Q in (the topology of T) & Z = ( Q /\ ( [#] Y ) ))))
proof
assume Z in top1;
then Q[ Z ] by A1;
hence thesis;
end;

thus thesis by A1;
end;
( [#] Y ) c= ( [#] T );
then reconsider Y as  strict (SubSpace of T) by A2,CKB15:def 1;
take Y;
thus thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let Z1 being  strict (SubSpace of T);
let Z2 being  strict (SubSpace of T);
assume A3: (( [#] Z1 ) = P & ( [#] Z2 ) = P);
A4: (the topology of Z2) c= (the topology of Z1)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in (the topology of Z2);
then (ex Q being (Subset of T) st (Q in (the topology of T) & x = ( Q /\ ( [#] Z1 ) ))) by A3,CKB15:def 1;
hence thesis by CKB15:def 1;
end;
(the topology of Z1) c= (the topology of Z2)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in (the topology of Z1);
then (ex Q being (Subset of T) st (Q in (the topology of T) & x = ( Q /\ ( [#] Z2 ) ))) by A3,CKB15:def 1;
hence thesis by CKB15:def 1;
