theorem
(for A,B,C being TopSpace holds (for f being (Function of A,C) holds ((f is  continuous & C is (SubSpace of B)) implies (for h being (Function of A,B) holds (h = f implies h is  continuous)))))
proof
let A being TopSpace,B being TopSpace,C being TopSpace;
let f being (Function of A,C);
assume that
A1: f is  continuous
and
A2: C is (SubSpace of B);
let h being (Function of A,B);
assume that
A3: h = f;
(for P being (Subset of B) holds (P is  closed implies ( h " P ) is  closed))
proof
let P being (Subset of B);
assume that
A4: P is  closed;
A5: ( rng h ) c= (the carrier of C) by A3,RELAT_1:def 19;
A6: ( h " P ) = ( h " ( ( rng h ) /\ P ) ) by RELAT_1:133
.= ( h " ( ( ( rng h ) /\ ( [#] C ) ) /\ P ) ) by A5,XBOOLE_1:28
.= ( h " ( ( rng h ) /\ ( ( [#] C ) /\ P ) ) ) by XBOOLE_1:16
.= ( h " ( P /\ ( [#] C ) ) ) by RELAT_1:133;
reconsider C as (SubSpace of B) by A2;
reconsider Q = ( P /\ ( [#] C ) ) as (Subset of C);
Q is  closed by A4,CKB34:1;
hence thesis by A1,A3,A6,CKB27:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB27:def 1;
