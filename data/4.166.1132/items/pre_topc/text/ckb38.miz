theorem
Th46: (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (ex F being (Subset-Family of GX) st ((for C being (Subset of GX) holds (C in F iff (C is  closed & A c= C))) & ( Cl A ) = ( meet F ))))
proof
let A being (Subset of GX);
defpred Q[ set ]
 means
(ex C1 being (Subset of GX) st ((C1 = $1 & C1 is  closed) & A c= $1));
consider F9 being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A1: (for C being (Subset of GX) holds (C in F9 iff Q[ C ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
take F = F9;
thus (for C being (Subset of GX) holds (C in F iff (C is  closed & A c= C)))
proof
let C being (Subset of GX);
thus (C in F implies (C is  closed & A c= C))
proof
assume C in F;
then (ex C1 being (Subset of GX) st ((C1 = C & C1 is  closed) & A c= C)) by A1;
hence thesis;
end;

thus thesis by A1;
end;

A c= ( [#] GX );
then A2: F <> ( {} ) by A1;
(for p being set holds (p in ( Cl A ) iff p in ( meet F )))
proof
let p being set;
A3:now
assume A4: p in ( meet F );
now
let C being (Subset of GX);
assume (C is  closed & A c= C);
then C in F by A1;
hence p in C by A4,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
hence p in ( Cl A ) by A4,CKB37:1;

now
assume A5: p in ( Cl A );
now
let C being set;
assume C in F;
then (ex C1 being (Subset of GX) st ((C1 = C & C1 is  closed) & A c= C)) by A1;
hence p in C by A5,CKB37:1;
