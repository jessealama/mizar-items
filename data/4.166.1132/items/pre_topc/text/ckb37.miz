theorem
Th45: (for A being (Subset of T) holds (for p being set holds (p in (the carrier of T) implies (p in ( Cl A ) iff (for C being (Subset of T) holds (C is  closed implies (A c= C implies p in C)))))))
proof
let A being (Subset of T);
let p being set;
assume that
A1: p in (the carrier of T);
A2:now
assume A3: (for C being (Subset of T) holds (C is  closed implies (A c= C implies p in C)));
(for G being (Subset of T) holds (G is  open implies (p in G implies A meets G)))
proof
let G being (Subset of T);
assume that
A4: G is  open;
( ( [#] T ) \ ( ( [#] T ) \ G ) ) = G by CKB9:1;
then ( ( [#] T ) \ G ) is  closed by A4,CKB14:def 1;
then (A c= ( G ` ) implies p in ( ( [#] T ) \ G )) by A3;
hence thesis by SUBSET_1:23,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
hence p in ( Cl A ) by A1,CKB36:def 1;
end;
now
assume A5: p in ( Cl A );
let C being (Subset of T);
assume C is  closed;
then ( ( [#] T ) \ C ) is  open by CKB14:def 1;
then (p in ( ( [#] T ) \ C ) implies A meets ( ( [#] T ) \ C )) by A5,CKB36:def 1;
then (A c= ( ( ( [#] T ) \ C ) ` ) implies (p in C or (not p in ( [#] T )))) by SUBSET_1:23,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence (A c= C implies p in C) by A1,CKB9:1;
end;
hence thesis by A2;
