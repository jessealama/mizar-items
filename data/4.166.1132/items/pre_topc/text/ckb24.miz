theorem
(for S being TopSpace holds (for P1,P2 being (Subset of S) holds (for P19 being (Subset of ( S | P2 )) holds ((P1 = P19 & P1 c= P2) implies ( S | P1 ) = ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 )))))
proof
let S being TopSpace;
let P1 being (Subset of S),P2 being (Subset of S);
let P19 being (Subset of ( S | P2 ));
assume that
A1: P1 = P19
and
A2: P1 c= P2;
A3: ( [#] ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 ) ) = P1 by A1,CKB20:def 1;
A4: ( [#] ( S | P2 ) ) = P2 by CKB20:def 1;
A5: (for R being (Subset of ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 )) holds (R in (the topology of ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 )) iff (ex Q being (Subset of S) st (Q in (the topology of S) & R = ( Q /\ ( [#] ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 ) ) )))))
proof
let R being (Subset of ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 ));
A6:now
given Q being (Subset of S) such that
A7: Q in (the topology of S)
and
A8: R = ( Q /\ ( [#] ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 ) ) );

reconsider R9 = ( Q /\ ( [#] ( S | P2 ) ) ) as (Subset of ( S | P2 ));
A9: R9 in (the topology of ( S | P2 )) by A7,CKB15:def 1;
( R9 /\ ( [#] ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 ) ) ) = ( Q /\ ( P2 /\ P1 ) ) by A4,A3,XBOOLE_1:16
.= R by A2,A3,A8,XBOOLE_1:28;
hence R in (the topology of ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 )) by A9,CKB15:def 1;
end;
now
assume R in (the topology of ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 ));
then consider Q0 being (Subset of ( S | P2 )) such that A10: Q0 in (the topology of ( S | P2 )) and A11: R = ( Q0 /\ ( [#] ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 ) ) ) by CKB15:def 1;
consider Q1 being (Subset of S) such that A12: Q1 in (the topology of S) and A13: Q0 = ( Q1 /\ ( [#] ( S | P2 ) ) ) by A10,CKB15:def 1;
R = ( Q1 /\ ( P2 /\ P1 ) ) by A4,A3,A11,A13,XBOOLE_1:16
.= ( Q1 /\ ( [#] ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 ) ) ) by A2,A3,XBOOLE_1:28;
hence (ex Q being (Subset of S) st (Q in (the topology of S) & R = ( Q /\ ( [#] ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 ) ) ))) by A12;
end;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
( [#] ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 ) ) c= ( [#] S ) by A3;
then ( ( S | P2 ) | P19 ) is (SubSpace of S) by A5,CKB15:def 1;
hence thesis by A3,CKB20:def 1;
end;
