definition
let GX being TopStruct;
let A being (Subset of GX);
func Cl A -> (Subset of GX)
means
:Def13: (for p being set holds (p in (the carrier of GX) implies (p in it iff (for G being (Subset of GX) holds (G is  open implies (p in G implies A meets G))))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(for G being (Subset of GX) holds (G is  open implies ($1 in G implies A meets G)));
consider P being (Subset of GX) such that A1: (for x being set holds (x in P iff (x in (the carrier of GX) & P[ x ]))) from SUBSET_1:sch 1;
take P;
thus thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let C1 being (Subset of GX),C2 being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A2: (for p being set holds (p in (the carrier of GX) implies (p in C1 iff (for G being (Subset of GX) holds (G is  open implies (p in G implies A meets G))))))
and
A3: (for p being set holds (p in (the carrier of GX) implies (p in C2 iff (for V being (Subset of GX) holds (V is  open implies (p in V implies A meets V))))));
(for x being set holds (x in C1 iff x in C2))
proof
let x being set;
thus (x in C1 implies x in C2)
proof
assume A4: x in C1;
then (for G being (Subset of GX) holds (G is  open implies (x in G implies A meets G))) by A2;
hence thesis by A3,A4;
end;

assume A5: x in C2;
then (for V being (Subset of GX) holds (V is  open implies (x in V implies A meets V))) by A3;
hence thesis by A2,A5;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
end;
projectivity
proof
let r being (Subset of GX),A being (Subset of GX);
assume A6: (for p being set holds (p in (the carrier of GX) implies (p in r iff (for G being (Subset of GX) holds (G is  open implies (p in G implies A meets G))))));
let p being set;
assume that
A7: p in (the carrier of GX);
thus (p in r implies (for G being (Subset of GX) holds ((G is  open & p in G) implies r meets G))) by XBOOLE_0:3;
assume A8: (for G being (Subset of GX) holds (G is  open implies (p in G implies r meets G)));
A9:now
let C being (Subset of GX);
assume C is  closed;
then A10: ( ( [#] GX ) \ C ) is  open by CKB14:def 1;
now
assume p in ( ( [#] GX ) \ C );
then r meets ( ( [#] GX ) \ C ) by A8,A10;
then (ex x being set st (x in r & x in ( ( [#] GX ) \ C ))) by XBOOLE_0:3;
hence A meets ( ( [#] GX ) \ C ) by A6,A10;
end;
then (A c= ( ( ( [#] GX ) \ C ) ` ) implies (p in C or (not p in ( [#] GX )))) by SUBSET_1:23,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence (A c= C implies p in C) by A7,CKB9:1;
end;
(for G being (Subset of GX) holds (G is  open implies (p in G implies A meets G)))
proof
let G being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A11: G is  open;
( ( [#] GX ) \ ( ( [#] GX ) \ G ) ) = G by CKB9:1;
then ( ( [#] GX ) \ G ) is  closed by A11,CKB14:def 1;
then (A c= ( G ` ) implies p in ( ( [#] GX ) \ G )) by A9;
hence thesis by SUBSET_1:23,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
hence thesis by A6,A7;
end;
