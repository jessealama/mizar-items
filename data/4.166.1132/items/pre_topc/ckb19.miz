let T being TopSpace;

coherence
proof
let S being (SubSpace of T);
S is  TopSpace-like
proof
set P = (the carrier of S);
A1: ( [#] T ) in (the topology of T) by CKB2:def 1;
A2: P = ( [#] S );
then P c= ( [#] T ) by CKB15:def 1;
then ( ( [#] T ) /\ P ) = P by XBOOLE_1:28;
hence (the carrier of S) in (the topology of S) by A2,A1,CKB15:def 1;
thus (for a being (Subset-Family of S) holds (a c= (the topology of S) implies ( union a ) in (the topology of S)))
proof
let a being (Subset-Family of S);
assume that
A3: a c= (the topology of S);
defpred Q[ set ]
 means
(( $1 /\ (the carrier of S) ) in a & $1 in (the topology of T));
consider b being (Subset-Family of T) such that A4: (for Z being (Subset of T) holds (Z in b iff Q[ Z ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
A5: ( ( union b ) /\ P ) c= ( union a )
proof
let x being set;
assume A6: x in ( ( union b ) /\ P );
then x in ( union b ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider Z being set such that A7: x in Z and A8: Z in b by TARSKI:def 4;
x in P by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A9: x in ( Z /\ P ) by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
( Z /\ P ) in a by A4,A8;
hence thesis by A9,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
b c= (the topology of T)
proof
let y being set;
assume y in b;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
then A10: ( union b ) in (the topology of T) by CKB2:def 1;
( union a ) c= ( ( union b ) /\ P )
proof
let x being set;
assume A11: x in ( union a );
then consider Z1 being set such that A12: x in Z1 and A13: Z1 in a by TARSKI:def 4;
consider Z3 being (Subset of T) such that A14: (Z3 in (the topology of T) & Z1 = ( Z3 /\ P )) by A2,A3,A13,CKB15:def 1;
(Z3 in b & x in Z3) by A4,A12,A13,A14,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then x in ( union b ) by TARSKI:def 4;
hence thesis by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 4;

then ( union a ) = ( ( union b ) /\ P ) by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;

thus (for V,Q being (Subset of S) holds ((V in (the topology of S) & Q in (the topology of S)) implies ( V /\ Q ) in (the topology of S)))
proof
let V being (Subset of S),Q being (Subset of S);
assume that
A15: V in (the topology of S)
and
A16: Q in (the topology of S);
consider P1 being (Subset of T) such that A17: P1 in (the topology of T) and A18: V = ( P1 /\ P ) by A2,A15,CKB15:def 1;
consider Q1 being (Subset of T) such that A19: Q1 in (the topology of T) and A20: Q = ( Q1 /\ P ) by A2,A16,CKB15:def 1;
A21: ( V /\ Q ) = ( P1 /\ ( ( Q1 /\ P ) /\ P ) ) by A18,A20,XBOOLE_1:16
.= ( P1 /\ ( Q1 /\ ( P /\ P ) ) ) by XBOOLE_1:16
.= ( ( P1 /\ Q1 ) /\ P ) by XBOOLE_1:16;
( P1 /\ Q1 ) in (the topology of T) by A17,A19,CKB2:def 1;
hence thesis by A2,A21,CKB15:def 1;
end;

end;
hence thesis;
