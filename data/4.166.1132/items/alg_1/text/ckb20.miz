existence
proof
A2: ( dom f ) = (the carrier of U1) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then reconsider A = ( f .: (the carrier of U1) ) as non  empty (Subset of U2);
take B = ( UniAlgSetClosed A );
A is  opers_closed
proof
let o2 being (operation of U2);

A6: (for x holds (x in ( dom s ) implies (ex y st (y in (the carrier of U1) & P[ x,y ]))))
proof
let x;
assume A7: x in ( dom s );
then reconsider x0 = x as (Element of ( NAT ));
( s . x0 ) in A by A7,FINSEQ_2:11;
then consider y such that A8: y in ( dom f ) and y in (the carrier of U1) and A9: ( f . y ) = ( s . x0 ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;

thus thesis by A8,A9;

uniqueness
proof
let A being  strict (SubAlgebra of U2);
