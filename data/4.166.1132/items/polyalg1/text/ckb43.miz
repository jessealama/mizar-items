theorem
Th21: (for L being non  empty multMagma holds (for B being non  empty AlgebraStr over L holds (for A being non  empty (Subset of B) holds (for X being (Subset-Family of B) holds ((for Y being set holds (Y in X iff (Y c= (the carrier of B) & (ex C being (Subalgebra of B) st (Y = (the carrier of C) & A c= Y))))) implies ( meet X ) is  opers_closed)))))
proof
let L being non  empty multMagma;
let B being non  empty AlgebraStr over L;
let A being non  empty (Subset of B);
let X being (Subset-Family of B);
assume that
A1: (for Y being set holds (Y in X iff (Y c= (the carrier of B) & (ex C being (Subalgebra of B) st (Y = (the carrier of C) & A c= Y)))));
B is (Subalgebra of B) by CKB30:1;
then A2: X <> ( {} ) by A1;
A3: (for x,y being (Element of B) holds ((x in ( meet X ) & y in ( meet X )) implies ( x + y ) in ( meet X )))
proof
let x being (Element of B);
let y being (Element of B);
assume that
A4: (x in ( meet X ) & y in ( meet X ));
now
reconsider x9 = x,y9 = y as (Element of B);
let Y being set;
assume A5: Y in X;
then consider C being (Subalgebra of B) such that A6: Y = (the carrier of C) and A7: A c= Y by A1;
reconsider C as non  empty (Subalgebra of B) by A6,A7;
reconsider x1 = x9,y1 = y9 as (Element of C) by A4,A5,A6,SETFAM_1:def 1;
( x + y ) = ( x1 + y1 ) by CKB38:1;
hence ( x + y ) in Y by A6;
end;
hence thesis by A2,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
(for a being (Element of L) holds (for v being (Element of B) holds (v in ( meet X ) implies ( a * v ) in ( meet X ))))
proof
let a being (Element of L);
let v being (Element of B);
assume that
A8: v in ( meet X );
now
let Y being set;
assume A9: Y in X;
then consider C being (Subalgebra of B) such that A10: Y = (the carrier of C) and A11: A c= Y by A1;
reconsider C as non  empty (Subalgebra of B) by A10,A11;
reconsider v9 = v as (Element of C) by A8,A9,A10,SETFAM_1:def 1;
( a * v ) = ( a * v9 ) by CKB40:1;
hence ( a * v ) in Y by A10;
end;
hence thesis by A2,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
hence ( meet X ) is  linearly-closed by A3,VECTSP_4:def 1;
thus (for x,y being (Element of B) holds ((x in ( meet X ) & y in ( meet X )) implies ( x * y ) in ( meet X )))
proof
let x being (Element of B);
let y being (Element of B);
assume that
A12: (x in ( meet X ) & y in ( meet X ));
now
reconsider x9 = x,y9 = y as (Element of B);
let Y being set;
assume A13: Y in X;
then consider C being (Subalgebra of B) such that A14: Y = (the carrier of C) and A15: A c= Y by A1;
reconsider C as non  empty (Subalgebra of B) by A14,A15;
reconsider x1 = x9,y1 = y9 as (Element of C) by A12,A13,A14,SETFAM_1:def 1;
( x * y ) = ( x1 * y1 ) by CKB39:1;
hence ( x * y ) in Y by A14;
end;
hence thesis by A2,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;

now
let Y being set;
assume Y in X;
then consider C being (Subalgebra of B) such that A16: Y = (the carrier of C) and A17: A c= Y by A1;
reconsider C as non  empty (Subalgebra of B) by A16,A17;
( 1. B ) = ( 1. C ) by CKB29:def 1;
hence ( 1. B ) in Y by A16;
end;
hence ( 1. B ) in ( meet X ) by A2,SETFAM_1:def 1;
now
let Y being set;
assume Y in X;
then consider C being (Subalgebra of B) such that A18: Y = (the carrier of C) and A19: A c= Y by A1;
reconsider C as non  empty (Subalgebra of B) by A18,A19;
( 0. B ) = ( 0. C ) by CKB29:def 1;
hence ( 0. B ) in Y by A18;
end;
hence thesis by A2,SETFAM_1:def 1;
