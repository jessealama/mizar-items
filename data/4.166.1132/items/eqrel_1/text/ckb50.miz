theorem
Th43: (for P being (a_partition of X) holds (ex EqR st P = ( Class EqR )))
proof
let P being (a_partition of X);
A1: (X <> ( {} ) implies (ex EqR st P = ( Class EqR )))
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(ex A st ((A in P & $1 in A) & $2 in A));
assume X <> ( {} );
A2: (for x holds (for y holds (for z holds ((P[ x,y ] & P[ y,z ]) implies P[ x,z ]))))
proof
let x;
let y;
let z;
given A such that
A3: A in P
and
A4: (x in A & y in A);

given B such that
A5: B in P
and
A6: (y in B & z in B);

(A = B or A misses B) by A3,A5,CKB47:def 1;
hence thesis by A3,A4,A6,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
A7: ( union P ) = X by CKB47:def 1;
A8: (for x holds (x in X implies P[ x,x ]))
proof
let x;
assume x in X;
then consider Z such that A9: x in Z and A10: Z in P by A7,TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider A = Z as (Subset of X) by A10;
take A;
thus thesis by A9,A10;
end;
A11: (for x holds (for y holds (P[ x,y ] implies P[ y,x ])));
consider R being (Equivalence_Relation of X) such that A12: (for x holds (for y holds ([ x,y ] in R iff ((x in X & y in X) & P[ x,y ])))) from CKB28:sch 1(A8,A11,A2);
take R;
now

now
let y;
A17:now
assume y in ( Class (R,x) );
then [ y,x ] in R by CKB32:1;
then consider B such that A18: (B in P & y in B) and A19: x in B by A12;
A meets B by A15,A19,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence y in A by A14,A18,CKB47:def 1;
end;
now
assume y in A;
then [ y,x ] in R by A12,A14,A16;
hence y in ( Class (R,x) ) by CKB32:1;
end;
hence (y in A iff y in ( Class (R,x) )) by A17;
end;
then A = ( Class (R,x) ) by TARSKI:1;
hence A in ( Class R ) by A16,CKB45:def 1;
end;
now
assume A in ( Class R );
then consider x such that A20: x in X and A21: A = ( Class (R,x) ) by CKB45:def 1;
x in ( Class (R,x) ) by A20,CKB33:1;
then [ x,x ] in R by CKB32:1;
then consider B such that A22: B in P and A23: x in B and x in B by A12;
now
let y;
A24:now
assume y in A;
then [ y,x ] in R by A21,CKB32:1;
then consider C such that A25: (C in P & y in C) and A26: x in C by A12;
B meets C by A23,A26,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence y in B by A22,A25,CKB47:def 1;
end;
now
assume y in B;
then [ y,x ] in R by A12,A22,A23;
hence y in A by A21,CKB32:1;
end;
hence (y in A iff y in B) by A24;
end;
hence A in P by A22,TARSKI:1;
end;
hence (A in P iff A in ( Class R )) by A13;
end;
hence thesis by SETFAM_1:31;
end;
(X = ( {} ) implies (ex EqR st P = ( Class EqR )))
proof
set EqR1 = the (Equivalence_Relation of X);
assume A27: X = ( {} );
take EqR1;
P = ( {} ) by A27,CKB48:1;
hence thesis by A27,CKB46:1;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
