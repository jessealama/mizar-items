theorem
Th25: (( incl E ) is  full iff (for a,b being (Object of E) holds (for a9,b9 being (Object of C) holds ((a = a9 & b = b9) implies ( Hom (a,b) ) = ( Hom (a9,b9) )))))
proof
set T = ( incl E );
thus (T is  full implies (for a,b being (Object of E) holds (for a9,b9 being (Object of C) holds ((a = a9 & b = b9) implies ( Hom (a,b) ) = ( Hom (a9,b9) )))))
proof
assume A1: (for a,b being (Object of E) holds (( Hom (( T . a ),( T . b )) ) <> ( {} ) implies (for g being (Morphism of ( T . a ),( T . b )) holds (( Hom (a,b) ) <> ( {} ) & (ex f being (Morphism of a,b) st g = ( T . f ))))));
let a being (Object of E),b being (Object of E);
let a9 being (Object of C),b9 being (Object of C);
assume that
A2: (a = a9 & b = b9);
now
let x being set;
( Hom (a,b) ) c= ( Hom (a9,b9) ) by A2,CKB16:def 1;
hence (x in ( Hom (a,b) ) implies x in ( Hom (a9,b9) ));
assume A3: x in ( Hom (a9,b9) );
A4: (( T . a ) = a9 & ( T . b ) = b9) by A2,CKB27:1;
then reconsider g = x as (Morphism of ( T . a ),( T . b )) by A3,CAT_1:def 4;
consider f being (Morphism of a,b) such that A5: g = ( T . f ) by A1,A4,A3;
A6: g = f by A5,FUNCT_1:18;
( Hom (a,b) ) <> ( {} ) by A1,A4,A3;
hence x in ( Hom (a,b) ) by A6,CAT_1:def 4;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
end;

assume A7: (for a,b being (Object of E) holds (for a9,b9 being (Object of C) holds ((a = a9 & b = b9) implies ( Hom (a,b) ) = ( Hom (a9,b9) ))));
let a being (Object of E),b being (Object of E);
assume that
A8: ( Hom (( T . a ),( T . b )) ) <> ( {} );
let g being (Morphism of ( T . a ),( T . b ));
A9: g in ( Hom (( T . a ),( T . b )) ) by A8,CAT_1:def 4;
A10: (a = ( T . a ) & b = ( T . b )) by CKB27:1;
hence ( Hom (a,b) ) <> ( {} ) by A7,A8;
( Hom (a,b) ) = ( Hom (( T . a ),( T . b )) ) by A7,A10;
then reconsider f = g as (Morphism of a,b) by A9,CAT_1:def 4;
take f;
thus thesis by FUNCT_1:18;
