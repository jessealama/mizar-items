theorem
Th6: ((((( dom fi ) = ( dom psi ) & B is_limes_of fi) & C is_limes_of psi) & ((for A holds (A in ( dom fi ) implies ( fi . A ) c= ( psi . A ))) or (for A holds (A in ( dom fi ) implies ( fi . A ) in ( psi . A ))))) implies B c= C)
proof
assume that
A1: ( dom fi ) = ( dom psi )
and
A2: ((B = ( {} ) & (ex A1 st (A1 in ( dom fi ) & (for C holds ((A1 c= C & C in ( dom fi )) implies ( fi . C ) = ( {} )))))) or (B <> ( {} ) & (for A1 holds (for C holds ((A1 in B & B in C) implies (ex D st (D in ( dom fi ) & (for E being Ordinal holds ((D c= E & E in ( dom fi )) implies (A1 in ( fi . E ) & ( fi . E ) in C))))))))))
and
A3: ((C = ( {} ) & (ex B st (B in ( dom psi ) & (for A1 holds ((B c= A1 & A1 in ( dom psi )) implies ( psi . A1 ) = ( {} )))))) or (C <> ( {} ) & (for B holds (for A1 holds ((B in C & C in A1) implies (ex D st (D in ( dom psi ) & (for E being Ordinal holds ((D c= E & E in ( dom psi )) implies (B in ( psi . E ) & ( psi . E ) in A1))))))))))
and
A4: ((for A holds (A in ( dom fi ) implies ( fi . A ) c= ( psi . A ))) or (for A holds (A in ( dom fi ) implies ( fi . A ) in ( psi . A ))));
A5:now
let A;
reconsider A1 = ( fi . A ),A2 = ( psi . A ) as Ordinal;
assume A in ( dom fi );
then (A1 c= A2 or A1 in A2) by A4;
hence ( fi . A ) c= ( psi . A ) by ORDINAL1:def 2;
end;
now
per cases ;
suppose (B = ( {} ) & C = ( {} ));

hence thesis;
end;
suppose (B = ( {} ) & C <> ( {} ));

then B in C by ORDINAL3:8;
hence thesis by ORDINAL1:def 2;
end;
suppose A6: (B <> ( {} ) & C = ( {} ));

then ( {} ) in B by ORDINAL3:8;
then consider A2 being Ordinal such that A7: A2 in ( dom fi ) and A8: (for A holds ((A2 c= A & A in ( dom fi )) implies (( {} ) in ( fi . A ) & ( fi . A ) in ( succ B )))) by A2,ORDINAL1:6;
consider A1 such that A9: A1 in ( dom psi ) and A10: (for A holds ((A1 c= A & A in ( dom psi )) implies ( psi . A ) = ( {} ))) by A3,A6;
A11: (( A1 \/ A2 ) = A1 or ( A1 \/ A2 ) = A2) by ORDINAL3:12;
then A12: ( fi . ( A1 \/ A2 ) ) c= ( psi . ( A1 \/ A2 ) ) by A1,A5,A9,A7;
A2 c= ( A1 \/ A2 ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
then ( {} ) in ( fi . ( A1 \/ A2 ) ) by A1,A9,A7,A8,A11;
hence thesis by A1,A9,A10,A7,A11,A12,XBOOLE_1:7;
end;
suppose A13: (B <> ( {} ) & C <> ( {} ));

assume (not B c= C);
then C in B by ORDINAL1:16;
then consider A1 such that A14: A1 in ( dom fi ) and A15: (for A holds ((A1 c= A & A in ( dom fi )) implies (C in ( fi . A ) & ( fi . A ) in ( succ B )))) by A2,ORDINAL1:6;
( {} ) in C by A13,ORDINAL3:8;
then consider A2 being Ordinal such that A16: A2 in ( dom psi ) and A17: (for A holds ((A2 c= A & A in ( dom psi )) implies (( {} ) in ( psi . A ) & ( psi . A ) in ( succ C )))) by A3,ORDINAL1:6;
A18: (( A1 \/ A2 ) = A1 or ( A1 \/ A2 ) = A2) by ORDINAL3:12;
reconsider A3 = ( psi . ( A1 \/ A2 ) ) as Ordinal;
A2 c= ( A1 \/ A2 ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
then ( psi . ( A1 \/ A2 ) ) in ( succ C ) by A1,A14,A16,A17,A18;
then A19: A3 c= C by ORDINAL1:22;
A1 c= ( A1 \/ A2 ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
then A20: C in ( fi . ( A1 \/ A2 ) ) by A1,A14,A15,A16,A18;
( fi . ( A1 \/ A2 ) ) c= ( psi . ( A1 \/ A2 ) ) by A1,A5,A14,A16,A18;
hence contradiction by A20,A19,ORDINAL1:5;

hence thesis;
