let X being non  empty TopSpace;
func C_0_Functions X -> non  empty (Subset of ( RealVectSpace (the carrier of X) )) equals

correctness
proof
L1: { f where f is (RealMap of X): (f is  continuous & (ex Y being non  empty (Subset of X) st (Y is  compact & (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A = ( support f ) implies ( Cl A ) is (Subset of Y)))))) } c= ( Funcs ((the carrier of X),( REAL )) )
proof
(for x being set holds (x in { f where f is (RealMap of X): (f is  continuous & (ex Y being non  empty (Subset of X) st (Y is  compact & (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A = ( support f ) implies ( Cl A ) is (Subset of Y)))))) } implies x in ( Funcs ((the carrier of X),( REAL )) )))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in { f where f is (RealMap of X): (f is  continuous & (ex Y being non  empty (Subset of X) st (Y is  compact & (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A = ( support f ) implies ( Cl A ) is (Subset of Y)))))) };

hence x in ( Funcs ((the carrier of X),( REAL )) ) by FUNCT_2:8;

proof
set g = ( (the carrier of X) --> ( 0 ) );
reconsider g as (RealMap of X) by FUNCOP_1:46;
A1: g is  continuous
proof
(for P being (Subset of ( REAL )) holds (P is  closed implies ( g " P ) is  closed))
proof
let P being (Subset of ( REAL ));
assume that
P is  closed;
set F = ( (the carrier of X) --> ( 0 ) );
set H = (the carrier of X);
set HX = ( [#] X );
per cases ;
suppose ( 0 ) in P;

then ( g " P ) = HX by FUNCOP_1:14;
hence ( g " P ) is  closed;
end;
suppose (not ( 0 ) in P);

then ( F " P ) = ( {} X ) by FUNCOP_1:16;
hence ( g " P ) is  closed;
end;

hence thesis by PSCOMP_1:def 3;

A5: (ex Y being non  empty (Subset of X) st (Y is  compact & (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A = ( support g ) implies ( Cl A ) is (Subset of Y)))))
proof
set S = the  compact non  empty (Subset of X);
A6: (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A = ( support g ) implies ( Cl A ) is (Subset of S)))
proof
let A being (Subset of X);
assume A7: A = ( support g );
A8: A = ( {} )
proof
assume A9: (not thesis);
set p = the (Element of ( support g ));
A10: p in A by A9,A7;
( g . p ) <> ( 0 ) by A7,A9,PRE_POLY:def 7;
hence contradiction by A10,FUNCOP_1:7;
end;
( Cl A ) = ( {} X ) by A8,PRE_TOPC:22;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_1:2;

thus thesis by A6;
