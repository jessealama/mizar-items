theorem
Th10: (for W being Normed_AlgebraStr holds (for V being Algebra holds (( the AlgebraStr of W ) = V implies W is Algebra)))
proof
let W being Normed_AlgebraStr;
let V being Algebra;
assume that
A1: ( the AlgebraStr of W ) = V;
reconsider W as non  empty AlgebraStr by A1;
A2: (for x,y being (VECTOR of W) holds ( x + y ) = ( y + x ))
proof
let x being (VECTOR of W);
let y being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y as (VECTOR of V) by A1;
( x + y ) = ( x1 + y1 ) by A1;
then ( x + y ) = ( y1 + x1 );
hence ( x + y ) = ( y + x ) by A1;
end;
A3: (for x,y,z being (VECTOR of W) holds ( ( x + y ) + z ) = ( x + ( y + z ) ))
proof
let x being (VECTOR of W);
let y being (VECTOR of W);
let z being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y,z1 = z as (VECTOR of V) by A1;
( ( x + y ) + z ) = ( ( x1 + y1 ) + z1 ) by A1;
then ( ( x + y ) + z ) = ( x1 + ( y1 + z1 ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 3;
hence ( ( x + y ) + z ) = ( x + ( y + z ) ) by A1;
end;
A4: (for x being (VECTOR of W) holds ( x + ( 0. W ) ) = x)
proof
let x being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider y = x as (VECTOR of V) by A1;
( x + ( 0. W ) ) = ( y + ( 0. V ) ) by A1;
hence ( x + ( 0. W ) ) = x by RLVECT_1:4;
end;
A5: (for x being (Element of W) holds x is  right_complementable)
proof
let x being (Element of W);
reconsider x1 = x as (Element of V) by A1;
consider v being (Element of V) such that A6: ( x1 + v ) = ( 0. V ) by ALGSTR_0:def 11;
reconsider y = v as (Element of W) by A1;
( x + y ) = ( 0. W ) by A6,A1;
hence thesis by ALGSTR_0:def 11;
end;
A7: (for v,w being (Element of W) holds ( v * w ) = ( w * v ))
proof
let v being (Element of W);
let w being (Element of W);
reconsider v1 = v,w1 = w as (Element of V) by A1;
( v * w ) = ( v1 * w1 ) by A1;
then ( v * w ) = ( w1 * v1 );
hence ( v * w ) = ( w * v ) by A1;
end;
A8: (for a,b,x being (Element of W) holds ( ( a * b ) * x ) = ( a * ( b * x ) ))
proof
let a being (Element of W);
let b being (Element of W);
let x being (Element of W);
reconsider y = x,a1 = a,b1 = b as (Element of V) by A1;
( ( a * b ) * x ) = ( ( a1 * b1 ) * y ) by A1;
then ( ( a * b ) * x ) = ( a1 * ( b1 * y ) ) by GROUP_1:def 3;
hence ( ( a * b ) * x ) = ( a * ( b * x ) ) by A1;
end;
A9: W is  right_unital
proof
let x being (Element of W);
reconsider x1 = x as (Element of V) by A1;
( x * ( 1. W ) ) = ( x1 * ( 1. V ) ) by A1;
hence ( x * ( 1. W ) ) = x by VECTSP_1:def 4;
end;
A10: W is  right-distributive
proof
let x being (Element of W);
let y being (Element of W);
let z being (Element of W);
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y,z1 = z as (Element of V) by A1;
( x * ( y + z ) ) = ( x1 * ( y1 + z1 ) ) by A1;
then ( x * ( y + z ) ) = ( ( x1 * y1 ) + ( x1 * z1 ) ) by VECTSP_1:def 2;
hence ( x * ( y + z ) ) = ( ( x * y ) + ( x * z ) ) by A1;
end;
W is  vector-distributive  scalar-distributive  scalar-associative  vector-associative
proof
thus W is  vector-distributive
proof
let a being  real number;
let x being (Element of W);
let y being (Element of W);
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y as (Element of V) by A1;
( a * ( x + y ) ) = ( a * ( x1 + y1 ) ) by A1;
then ( a * ( x + y ) ) = ( ( a * x1 ) + ( a * y1 ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 5;
hence ( a * ( x + y ) ) = ( ( a * x ) + ( a * y ) ) by A1;
end;

thus W is  scalar-distributive
proof
let a being  real number;
let b being  real number;
let x being (Element of W);
reconsider x1 = x as (Element of V) by A1;
( ( a + b ) * x ) = ( ( a + b ) * x1 ) by A1;
then ( ( a + b ) * x ) = ( ( a * x1 ) + ( b * x1 ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 6;
hence ( ( a + b ) * x ) = ( ( a * x ) + ( b * x ) ) by A1;
end;

thus W is  scalar-associative
proof
let a being  real number;
let b being  real number;
let x being (Element of W);
reconsider x1 = x as (Element of V) by A1;
( ( a * b ) * x ) = ( ( a * b ) * x1 ) by A1;
then ( ( a * b ) * x ) = ( a * ( b * x1 ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 7;
hence ( ( a * b ) * x ) = ( a * ( b * x ) ) by A1;
end;

let x being (Element of W);
let y being (Element of W);
let a being Real;
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y as (Element of V) by A1;
( a * ( x * y ) ) = ( a * ( x1 * y1 ) ) by A1;
then ( a * ( x * y ) ) = ( ( a * x1 ) * y1 ) by FUNCSDOM:def 9;
hence ( a * ( x * y ) ) = ( ( a * x ) * y ) by A1;
end;
hence thesis by A2,A3,A4,A5,A7,A8,A9,A10,ALGSTR_0:def 16,GROUP_1:def 3,GROUP_1:def 12,RLVECT_1:def 2,RLVECT_1:def 3,RLVECT_1:def 4;
