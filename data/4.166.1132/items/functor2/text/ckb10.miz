definition
let A being  transitive  with_units non empty AltCatStr;
let B being  transitive  with_units non empty AltCatStr;
let F being (Functor of A,B);
func idt F -> (transformation of F,F)
means
:Def3: (for a being (object of A) holds ( it . a ) = ( idm ( F . a ) ));
existence
proof
defpred P[ (object of A),set ]
 means
$2 = ( idm ( F . $1 ) );
A1: (for a being (Element of A) holds (ex j being set st P[ a,j ]));
consider t being (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of A)) such that A2: (for a being (Element of A) holds P[ a,( t . a ) ]) from PBOOLE:sch 6(A1);
(for a being (object of A) holds ( t . a ) is (Morphism of ( F . a ),( F . a )))
proof
let a being (Element of A);
P[ a,( t . a ) ] by A2;
hence thesis;
end;
then t is (transformation of F,F) by CKB9:def 1;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let it1 being (transformation of F,F),it2 being (transformation of F,F);
assume that
A3: (for a being (object of A) holds ( it1 . a ) = ( idm ( F . a ) ))
and
A4: (for a being (object of A) holds ( it2 . a ) = ( idm ( F . a ) ));
now
let a being set;
assume a in (the carrier of A);
then reconsider o = a as (object of A);
thus ( it1 . a ) = ( idm ( F . o ) ) by A3
.= ( it2 . a ) by A4;
end;
hence it1 = it2 by PBOOLE:3;
end;
end;
