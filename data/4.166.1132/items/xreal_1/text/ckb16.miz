theorem
Lm12: ((a <= b & ( 0 ) <= c) implies ( a * c ) <= ( b * c ))
proof
assume that
A1: a <= b
and
A2: ( 0 ) <= c;
(not o in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]) by ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;

(ex a99,b99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((a = a99 & b = b99) & a99 <=' b99)) by A1,A8,A9,XXREAL_0:def 5;
then ( a9 *' c9 ) <=' ( b9 *' c9 ) by A13,A10,ARYTM_1:8;
