proof
let L being  noetherian  complete Lattice;

 means
(ex D9 being (Subset of ( JIRRS L )) st ( % $1 ) = ( "\/" (D9,L) ));

proof
let x being (Element of ( LattPOSet L ));
set X = { d where d is (Element of L): (d [= ( % x ) & d <> ( % x )) };
A2: (for u being (Element of L) holds (u in X implies (( u % ) <> x & [ ( u % ),x ] in (the InternalRel of ( LattPOSet L )))))
proof
let u being (Element of L);

then A3: (ex u9 being (Element of L) st ((u9 = u & u9 [= ( % x )) & ( % x ) <> u9));
A4: ( % x ) = x by LATTICE3:def 4;
then ( ( % x ) % ) = x by LATTICE3:def 3;
then ( u % ) <= x by A3,LATTICE3:7;
