definition
let I being non empty ZeroStr;
func Q. I -> (Subset of [: (the carrier of I),(the carrier of I) :])
means
:Def1: (for u being set holds (u in it iff (ex a,b being (Element of I) st (u = [ a,b ] & b <> ( 0. I )))));
existence
proof
set M = { [ a,b ] where a is (Element of I),b is (Element of I): b <> ( 0. I ) };
(for u being set holds (u in M implies u in [: (the carrier of I),(the carrier of I) :]))
proof
let u being set;
assume u in M;
then (ex a,b being (Element of I) st (u = [ a,b ] & b <> ( 0. I )));
hence thesis;
end;
then A1: M is (Subset of [: (the carrier of I),(the carrier of I) :]) by TARSKI:def 3;
(for u being set holds (u in M iff (ex a,b being (Element of I) st (u = [ a,b ] & b <> ( 0. I )))));

uniqueness
proof
let M1 being (Subset of [: (the carrier of I),(the carrier of I) :]),M2 being (Subset of [: (the carrier of I),(the carrier of I) :]);
assume A2: (for u being set holds (u in M1 iff (ex a,b being (Element of I) st (u = [ a,b ] & b <> ( 0. I )))));

A4: (for u being set holds (u in M2 implies u in M1))
proof
let u being set;
assume u in M2;
then (ex a,b being (Element of I) st (u = [ a,b ] & b <> ( 0. I ))) by A3;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
(for u being set holds (u in M1 implies u in M2))
proof
let u being set;
assume u in M1;

hence thesis by A3;
