theorem
(for X being set holds ( X \+\ ( {} ) ) = X)
proof
let X being set;
thus ( X \+\ ( {} ) ) c= X
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( X \+\ ( {} ) );
then A1: (x in ( X \ ( {} ) ) or x in ( ( {} ) \ X )) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
per cases  by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
suppose (x in X & (not x in ( {} )));

hence thesis;
end;
suppose (x in ( {} ) & (not x in X));

hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
end;
end;

let x being set;
A2: (not x in ( {} )) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
assume x in X;
then x in ( X \ ( {} ) ) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
