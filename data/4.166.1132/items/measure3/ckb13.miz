proof
let S being (SigmaField of X);
let M being (sigma_Measure of S);
let G being (Function of ( NAT ),S),F being (Function of ( NAT ),S);
assume that

proof
let x being  ext-real number;
assume A4: x in ( rng ( M * F ) );
(x <> ( +infty ) implies l <= x)
proof
A5: ( dom ( M * F ) ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then consider n being set such that A6: n in ( NAT ) and A7: ( ( M * F ) . n ) = x by A4,FUNCT_1:def 3;
( M * F ) is  nonnegative by MEASURE2:1;
then A8: ( 0. ) <= x by A6,A7,SUPINF_2:39;
assume A9: x <> ( +infty );
reconsider x as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
x <= ( +infty ) by XXREAL_0:3;
then x < ( +infty ) by A9,XXREAL_0:1;

proof
defpred P[ (Element of ( NAT )) ]
 means
( F . $1 ) c= ( F . ( 0 ) );
A18: (for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (P[ k ] implies P[ ( k + 1 ) ]))
proof
let k being (Element of ( NAT ));

( F . ( k + 1 ) ) c= ( F . k ) by A3;
hence thesis by A19,XBOOLE_1:1;

(( sup ( rng ( M * G ) ) ) is Real & ( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) ) is Real) by A1,A2,A3,CKB11:1;
