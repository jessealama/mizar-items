theorem
Th19: (for S being (SigmaField of X) holds (for M being (sigma_Measure of S) holds (for F being (Function of ( NAT ),( COM (S,M) )) holds (for G being (Function of ( NAT ),S) holds (ex H being (Function of ( NAT ),( bool X )) st (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( H . n ) = ( ( F . n ) \ ( G . n ) )))))))
proof
let S being (SigmaField of X);
let M being (sigma_Measure of S);
let F being (Function of ( NAT ),( COM (S,M) ));
let G being (Function of ( NAT ),S);
defpred P[ (Element of ( NAT )),set ]
 means
(for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for y being set holds ((n = $1 & y = $2) implies y = ( ( F . n ) \ ( G . n ) ))));
A1: (for t being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (ex A being (Subset of X) st P[ t,A ]))
proof
let t being (Element of ( NAT ));
( F . t ) is (Element of ( COM (S,M) ));
then reconsider A = ( ( F . t ) \ ( G . t ) ) as (Subset of X) by XBOOLE_1:1;
take A;
thus thesis;
end;
(ex H being (Function of ( NAT ),( bool X )) st (for t being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ t,( H . t ) ])) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A1);
then consider H being (Function of ( NAT ),( bool X )) such that A2: (for t being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for y being set holds ((n = t & y = ( H . t )) implies y = ( ( F . n ) \ ( G . n ) )))));
take H;
thus thesis by A2;
