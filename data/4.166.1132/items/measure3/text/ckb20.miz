let X being set;
let S being (SigmaField of X);
let M being (sigma_Measure of S);
let A being (Element of ( COM (S,M) ));
func MeasPart A -> non empty (Subset-Family of X)
means

existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(for t being set holds (t = $1 implies ((t in S & t c= A) & ( A \ t ) is (thin of M))));
consider D being set such that A1: (for t being set holds (t in D iff (t in ( bool X ) & P[ t ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
A2: (for B being set holds (B in D iff ((B in S & B c= A) & ( A \ B ) is (thin of M))))
proof
let B being set;
(((B in S & B c= A) & ( A \ B ) is (thin of M)) implies B in D)
proof
assume that
A3: B in S
and
A4: (B c= A & ( A \ B ) is (thin of M));
(for t being set holds (t = B implies ((t in S & t c= A) & ( A \ t ) is (thin of M)))) by A3,A4;
hence thesis by A1,A3;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
A5: D c= ( bool X )
proof
let B being set;
assume B in D;
then B in S by A2;
hence thesis;
end;
D <> ( {} )
proof
consider B being set such that A6: B in S and A7: (ex C being (thin of M) st A = ( B \/ C )) by CKB19:def 1;
consider C being (thin of M) such that A8: A = ( B \/ C ) by A7;
consider E being set such that A9: E in S and A10: C c= E and A11: ( M . E ) = ( 0. ) by CKB18:def 1;
( A \ B ) = ( C \ B ) by A8,XBOOLE_1:40;
then ( A \ B ) c= C by XBOOLE_1:36;
then ( A \ B ) c= E by A10,XBOOLE_1:1;
then A12: ( A \ B ) is (thin of M) by A9,A11,CKB18:def 1;
B c= A by A8,XBOOLE_1:7;
hence thesis by A2,A6,A12;
end;
then reconsider D as non empty (Subset-Family of X) by A5;
take D;
thus thesis by A2;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let D1 being non empty (Subset-Family of X),D2 being non empty (Subset-Family of X);
assume that
A13: (for B being set holds (B in D1 iff ((B in S & B c= A) & ( A \ B ) is (thin of M))))
and
A14: (for B being set holds (B in D2 iff ((B in S & B c= A) & ( A \ B ) is (thin of M))));
(for B being set holds (B in D1 iff B in D2))
proof
let B being set;
thus (B in D1 implies B in D2)
proof
assume A15: B in D1;
then A16: ( A \ B ) is (thin of M) by A13;
(B in S & B c= A) by A13,A15;
hence thesis by A14,A16;
end;

assume A17: B in D2;
then A18: ( A \ B ) is (thin of M) by A14;
(B in S & B c= A) by A14,A17;
hence thesis by A13,A18;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
