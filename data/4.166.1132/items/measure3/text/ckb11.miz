theorem
Th11: (for S being (SigmaField of X) holds (for M being (sigma_Measure of S) holds (for G,F being (Function of ( NAT ),S) holds (((( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) ) < ( +infty ) & ( G . ( 0 ) ) = ( {} )) & (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (( G . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( F . ( 0 ) ) \ ( F . n ) ) & ( F . ( n + 1 ) ) c= ( F . n )))) implies ((( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) ) is Real & ( inf ( rng ( M * F ) ) ) is Real) & ( sup ( rng ( M * G ) ) ) is Real)))))
proof
let S being (SigmaField of X);
let M being (sigma_Measure of S);
let G being (Function of ( NAT ),S);
let F being (Function of ( NAT ),S);
assume that
A1: ( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) ) < ( +infty )
and
A2: ( G . ( 0 ) ) = ( {} )
and
A3: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (( G . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( F . ( 0 ) ) \ ( F . n ) ) & ( F . ( n + 1 ) ) c= ( F . n )));
reconsider P = ( {} ) as (Element of S) by PROB_1:4;
( M . P ) <= ( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) ) by MEASURE1:31,XBOOLE_1:2;
then ( 0. ) <= ( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) ) by VALUED_0:def 19;
hence A4: ( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) ) is Real by A1,XXREAL_0:46;
(for x being  ext-real number holds (x in ( rng ( M * G ) ) implies x <= ( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) )))
proof
let x being  ext-real number;
A5: ( dom ( M * G ) ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
assume x in ( rng ( M * G ) );
then consider n being set such that A6: n in ( NAT ) and A7: ( ( M * G ) . n ) = x by A5,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider n as (Element of ( NAT )) by A6;
A8: x = ( M . ( G . n ) ) by A5,A7,FUNCT_1:12;
A9: ((ex k being Nat st n = ( k + 1 )) implies x <= ( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) ))
proof
given k being Nat such that
A10: n = ( k + 1 );

reconsider k as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
( G . n ) = ( ( F . ( 0 ) ) \ ( F . k ) ) by A3,A10;
hence thesis by A8,MEASURE1:31,XBOOLE_1:36;
end;
(n = ( 0 ) implies x <= ( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) )) by A2,A8,MEASURE1:31,XBOOLE_1:2;
hence thesis by A9,NAT_1:6;
end;
then ( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) ) is (UpperBound of ( rng ( M * G ) )) by XXREAL_2:def 1;
then A11: ( sup ( rng ( M * G ) ) ) <= ( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) ) by XXREAL_2:def 3;
(for x being  ext-real number holds (x in ( rng ( M * F ) ) implies ( 0. ) <= x))
proof
let x being  ext-real number;
A12: ( dom ( M * F ) ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A13: ( M * F ) is  nonnegative by MEASURE2:1;
assume x in ( rng ( M * F ) );
then (ex n being set st (n in ( NAT ) & ( ( M * F ) . n ) = x)) by A12,FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A13,SUPINF_2:39;
end;
then ( 0. ) is (LowerBound of ( rng ( M * F ) )) by XXREAL_2:def 2;
then A14: ( inf ( rng ( M * F ) ) ) >= ( 0 ) by XXREAL_2:def 4;
(ex x being R_eal st (x in ( rng ( M * F ) ) & x = ( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) )))
proof
take ( ( M * F ) . ( 0 ) );
( dom ( M * F ) ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence thesis by FUNCT_1:12,FUNCT_2:4;
end;
then ( inf ( rng ( M * F ) ) ) <= ( M . ( F . ( 0 ) ) ) by XXREAL_2:3;
hence ( inf ( rng ( M * F ) ) ) is Real by A4,A14,XXREAL_0:45;
( 0. ) <= ( sup ( rng ( M * G ) ) )
proof
set x = ( ( M * G ) . ( 0 ) );
(for x being R_eal holds (x in ( rng ( M * G ) ) implies ( 0. ) <= x))
proof
let x being R_eal;
A15: ( dom ( M * G ) ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A16: ( M * G ) is  nonnegative by MEASURE2:1;
assume x in ( rng ( M * G ) );
then (ex n being set st (n in ( NAT ) & ( ( M * G ) . n ) = x)) by A15,FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A16,SUPINF_2:39;
end;
then A17: ( 0. ) <= x by FUNCT_2:4;
x <= ( sup ( rng ( M * G ) ) ) by FUNCT_2:4,XXREAL_2:4;
hence thesis by A17,XXREAL_0:2;
end;
hence thesis by A4,A11,XXREAL_0:45;
