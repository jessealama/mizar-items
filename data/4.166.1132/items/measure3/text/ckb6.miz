theorem
Th6: (for S being (SigmaField of X) holds (for G,F being (Function of ( NAT ),S) holds ((( G . ( 0 ) ) = ( {} ) & (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (( G . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( F . ( 0 ) ) \ ( F . n ) ) & ( F . ( n + 1 ) ) c= ( F . n )))) implies ( union ( rng G ) ) = ( ( F . ( 0 ) ) \ ( meet ( rng F ) ) ))))
proof
let S being (SigmaField of X);
let G being (Function of ( NAT ),S);
let F being (Function of ( NAT ),S);
assume that
A1: ( G . ( 0 ) ) = ( {} )
and
A2: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (( G . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( ( F . ( 0 ) ) \ ( F . n ) ) & ( F . ( n + 1 ) ) c= ( F . n )));
A3: ( dom G ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
thus ( union ( rng G ) ) c= ( ( F . ( 0 ) ) \ ( meet ( rng F ) ) )
proof
let A being set;
assume A in ( union ( rng G ) );
then consider Z being set such that A4: A in Z and A5: Z in ( rng G ) by TARSKI:def 4;
consider n being set such that A6: n in ( NAT ) and A7: Z = ( G . n ) by A3,A5,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider n as (Element of ( NAT )) by A6;
consider k being Nat such that A8: n = ( k + 1 ) by A1,A4,A7,NAT_1:6;
reconsider k as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
set Y = ( F . k );
A9: A in ( ( F . ( 0 ) ) \ ( F . k ) ) by A2,A4,A7,A8;
then (Y in ( rng F ) & (not A in Y)) by FUNCT_2:4,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then A10: (not A in ( meet ( rng F ) )) by SETFAM_1:def 1;
A in ( F . ( 0 ) ) by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence thesis by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;

let A being set;
assume A11: A in ( ( F . ( 0 ) ) \ ( meet ( rng F ) ) );
then (not A in ( meet ( rng F ) )) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then A12: (ex Y being set st (Y in ( rng F ) & (not A in Y))) by SETFAM_1:def 1;
A in ( F . ( 0 ) ) by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then consider Y being set such that A13: A in ( F . ( 0 ) ) and A14: Y in ( rng F ) and A15: (not A in Y) by A12;
( dom F ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then consider n being set such that A16: n in ( NAT ) and A17: Y = ( F . n ) by A14,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider n as (Element of ( NAT )) by A16;
A in ( ( F . ( 0 ) ) \ ( F . n ) ) by A13,A15,A17,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then A18: A in ( G . ( n + 1 ) ) by A2;
( G . ( n + 1 ) ) in ( rng G ) by FUNCT_2:4;
hence thesis by A18,TARSKI:def 4;
