theorem
Th23: (G is IncProjectivePlane iff (((G is  configuration & (for p holds (for q holds (ex M st { p,q } on M)))) & (for P holds (for Q holds (ex a st a on P,Q)))) & (ex a st (ex b st (ex c st (ex d st a,b,c,d is_a_quadrangle ))))))
proof
hereby
assume A1: G is IncProjectivePlane;
hence G is  configuration by CKB9:1;
thus (for p holds (for q holds (ex M st { p,q } on M))) by A1,CKB9:1;
thus (for P holds (for Q holds (ex a st a on P,Q)))
proof
let P;
let Q;
consider a such that A2: (a on P & a on Q) by A1,INCPROJ:def 9;
take a;
thus thesis by A2,CKB3:def 1;
end;

thus (ex a st (ex b st (ex c st (ex d st a,b,c,d is_a_quadrangle )))) by A1,CKB24:1;
end;
hereby
assume that
A3: G is  configuration
and
A4: (for p holds (for q holds (ex M st { p,q } on M)))
and
A5: (for P holds (for Q holds (ex a st a on P,Q)))
and
A6: (ex a st (ex b st (ex c st (ex d st a,b,c,d is_a_quadrangle ))));
(ex a st (ex b st (ex c st a,b,c is_a_triangle ))) by A6,CKB29:1;

then reconsider G9 = G as IncProjSp by A3,A4,A7,CKB9:1;
(for P,Q being (LINE of G9) holds (ex a being (POINT of G9) st (a on P & a on Q)))
proof
let P being (LINE of G9),Q being (LINE of G9);
consider a being (POINT of G9) such that A8: a on P,Q by A5;
take a;
thus thesis by A8,CKB3:def 1;

hence G is IncProjectivePlane by INCPROJ:def 9;
