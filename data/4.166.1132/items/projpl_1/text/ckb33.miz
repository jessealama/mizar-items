theorem
Th22: ((((G is  configuration & (for p holds (for q holds (ex M st { p,q } on M)))) & (for P holds (for Q holds (ex a st a on P,Q)))) & (ex a st (ex b st (ex c st (ex d st a,b,c,d is_a_quadrangle ))))) implies (for P holds (ex a st (ex b st (ex c st (a,b,c are_mutually_different  & { a,b,c } on P))))))
proof
assume that
A1: G is  configuration
and
A2: (for p holds (for q holds (ex M st { p,q } on M)))
and
A3: (for P holds (for Q holds (ex a st a on P,Q)))
and
A4: (ex a st (ex b st (ex c st (ex d st a,b,c,d is_a_quadrangle ))));
hereby
let P;
consider a,b,c,d such that A5: a,b,c,d is_a_quadrangle  by A4;
A6: a,b,c is_a_triangle  by A5,CKB15:def 1;
thus (ex a st (ex b st (ex c st (a,b,c are_mutually_different  & { a,b,c } on P))))
