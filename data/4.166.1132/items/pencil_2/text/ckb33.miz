theorem
Th24: (for I being non empty set holds (for A being  PLS-yielding (ManySortedSet of I) holds ((for i being (Element of I) holds ( A . i ) is  strongly_connected) implies (for B being (Segre-Coset of A) holds (for f being (Collineation of ( Segre_Product A )) holds ( f .: B ) is (Segre-Coset of A))))))
proof
let I being non empty set;
let A being  PLS-yielding (ManySortedSet of I);
assume A1: (for i being (Element of I) holds ( A . i ) is  strongly_connected);
let B being (Segre-Coset of A);
consider W being (Subset of ( Segre_Product A )) such that A2: W is non trivial  strong  closed_under_lines and A3: B = ( union { Y where Y is (Subset of ( Segre_Product A )): (Y is non trivial  strong  closed_under_lines & W,Y are_joinable ) } ) by A1,CKB32:1;
let f being (Collineation of ( Segre_Product A ));
reconsider g = ( f " ) as (Collineation of ( Segre_Product A )) by CKB22:1;
A4: ( dom f ) = (the carrier of ( Segre_Product A )) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A5: ( dom g ) = (the carrier of ( Segre_Product A )) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A6: f is  bijective by CKB17:def 1;
then A7: ( rng f ) = (the carrier of ( Segre_Product A )) by FUNCT_2:def 3;
A8: ( rng f ) = ( [#] ( Segre_Product A ) ) by A6,FUNCT_2:def 3;
A9: ( f .: B ) = ( union { Y where Y is (Subset of ( Segre_Product A )): (Y is non trivial  strong  closed_under_lines & ( f .: W ),Y are_joinable ) } )
proof
A10: W c= ( f " ( f .: W ) ) by A4,FUNCT_1:76;
( f " ( f .: W ) ) c= W by A6,FUNCT_1:82;
then A11: ( f " ( f .: W ) ) = W by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
thus ( f .: B ) c= ( union { Y where Y is (Subset of ( Segre_Product A )): (Y is non trivial  strong  closed_under_lines & ( f .: W ),Y are_joinable ) } )
proof
let o being set;
assume o in ( f .: B );
then consider u being set such that A12: u in ( dom f ) and A13: u in B and A14: o = ( f . u ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
consider y being set such that A15: u in y and A16: y in { Y where Y is (Subset of ( Segre_Product A )): (Y is non trivial  strong  closed_under_lines & W,Y are_joinable ) } by A3,A13,TARSKI:def 4;
consider Y being (Subset of ( Segre_Product A )) such that A17: y = Y and A18: Y is non trivial  strong  closed_under_lines and A19: W,Y are_joinable  by A16;
A20: ( f .: W ),( f .: Y ) are_joinable  by A2,A18,A19,CKB29:1;
( f .: Y ) is non trivial  strong  closed_under_lines by A18,CKB23:1,CKB25:1,CKB27:1;
then A21: ( f .: Y ) in { Z where Z is (Subset of ( Segre_Product A )): (Z is non trivial  strong  closed_under_lines & ( f .: W ),Z are_joinable ) } by A20;
o in ( f .: Y ) by A12,A14,A15,A17,FUNCT_1:def 6;
hence thesis by A21,TARSKI:def 4;
