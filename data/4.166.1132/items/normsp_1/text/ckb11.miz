proof
take X;
thus ( X ) is  reflexive
proof
thus ||. ( 0. ( X ) ) .|| = ( 0 ) by Lm5;

thus ( X ) is  discerning by Lm5,NORMSP_0:def 5;
thus ( X ) is  RealNormSpace-like by CKB10:def 1,Lm5;
thus ( X ) is  vector-distributive  scalar-distributive  scalar-associative  scalar-unital
proof
thus (for a being  real number holds (for v,w being (VECTOR of ( X )) holds ( a * ( v + w ) ) = ( ( a * v ) + ( a * w ) )))
proof
let a being  real number;
let v being (VECTOR of ( X )),w being (VECTOR of ( X ));
reconsider v9 = v,w9 = w as (VECTOR of ( (0). the RealLinearSpace ));
thus ( a * ( v + w ) ) = ( a * ( v9 + w9 ) )
.= ( ( a * v9 ) + ( a * w9 ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 5
.= ( ( a * v ) + ( a * w ) );
end;

thus (for a,b being  real number holds (for v being (VECTOR of ( X )) holds ( ( a + b ) * v ) = ( ( a * v ) + ( b * v ) )))
proof
let a being  real number,b being  real number;
let v being (VECTOR of ( X ));
reconsider v9 = v as (VECTOR of ( (0). the RealLinearSpace ));
thus ( ( a + b ) * v ) = ( ( a + b ) * v9 )
.= ( ( a * v9 ) + ( b * v9 ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 6
.= ( ( a * v ) + ( b * v ) );
end;

thus (for a,b being  real number holds (for v being (VECTOR of ( X )) holds ( ( a * b ) * v ) = ( a * ( b * v ) )))
proof
let a being  real number,b being  real number;
let v being (VECTOR of ( X ));
reconsider v9 = v as (VECTOR of ( (0). the RealLinearSpace ));
thus ( ( a * b ) * v ) = ( ( a * b ) * v9 )

let v being (VECTOR of ( X ));

A1: (for x,y being (VECTOR of ( X )) holds (for x9,y9 being (VECTOR of ( (0). the RealLinearSpace )) holds ((x = x9 & y = y9) implies (( x + y ) = ( x9 + y9 ) & (for a holds ( a * x ) = ( a * x9 ))))));
thus (for v,w being (VECTOR of ( X )) holds ( v + w ) = ( w + v ))
proof
let v being (VECTOR of ( X )),w being (VECTOR of ( X ));
reconsider v9 = v,w9 = w as (VECTOR of ( (0). the RealLinearSpace ));
thus ( v + w ) = ( w9 + v9 ) by A1
.= ( w + v );
end;

thus (for u,v,w being (VECTOR of ( X )) holds ( ( u + v ) + w ) = ( u + ( v + w ) ))
proof
let u being (VECTOR of ( X )),v being (VECTOR of ( X )),w being (VECTOR of ( X ));
reconsider u9 = u,v9 = v,w9 = w as (VECTOR of ( (0). the RealLinearSpace ));
thus ( ( u + v ) + w ) = ( ( u9 + v9 ) + w9 )
.= ( u9 + ( v9 + w9 ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 3
.= ( u + ( v + w ) );
end;

thus (for v being (VECTOR of ( X )) holds ( v + ( 0. ( X ) ) ) = v)
proof
let v being (VECTOR of ( X ));
reconsider v9 = v as (VECTOR of ( (0). the RealLinearSpace ));
thus ( v + ( 0. ( X ) ) ) = ( v9 + ( 0. ( (0). the RealLinearSpace ) ) )
.= v by RLVECT_1:4;
end;

thus ( X ) is  right_complementable
proof
let v being (VECTOR of ( X ));
reconsider v9 = v as (VECTOR of ( (0). the RealLinearSpace ));
consider w9 being (VECTOR of ( (0). the RealLinearSpace )) such that A2: ( v9 + w9 ) = ( 0. ( (0). the RealLinearSpace ) ) by ALGSTR_0:def 11;
reconsider w = w9 as (VECTOR of ( X ));
