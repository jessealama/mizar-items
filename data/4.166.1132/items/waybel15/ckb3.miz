theorem
(for X being set holds (for a being (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) holds ( uparrow a ) = { Y where Y is (Subset of X): a c= Y }))
proof
let X being set;
let a being (Element of ( BoolePoset X ));
A1: { Y where Y is (Subset of X): a c= Y } c= ( uparrow a )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in { Y where Y is (Subset of X): a c= Y };
then consider x9 being (Subset of X) such that A2: x9 = x and A3: a c= x9;
reconsider x9 as (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) by WAYBEL_8:26;
a <= x9 by A3,YELLOW_1:2;
hence thesis by A2,WAYBEL_0:18;
end;
( uparrow a ) c= { Y where Y is (Subset of X): a c= Y }
proof
let x being set;
assume A4: x in ( uparrow a );
then reconsider x9 = x as (Element of ( BoolePoset X ));
a <= x9 by A4,WAYBEL_0:18;
then (x9 is (Subset of X) & a c= x) by WAYBEL_8:26,YELLOW_1:2;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
