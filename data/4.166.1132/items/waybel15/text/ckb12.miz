theorem
Th12: (for L1,L2 being LATTICE holds ((L1,L2 are_isomorphic  & L1 is  lower-bounded  arithmetic) implies L2 is  arithmetic))
proof
let L1 being LATTICE,L2 being LATTICE;
assume that
A1: L1,L2 are_isomorphic 
and
A2: L1 is  lower-bounded  arithmetic;
consider f being (Function of L1,L2) such that A3: f is  isomorphic by A1,WAYBEL_1:def 8;
reconsider g = ( (f qua Function) " ) as (Function of L2,L1) by A3,WAYBEL_0:67;
A4: g is  isomorphic by A3,WAYBEL_0:68;
A5: L2 is  up-complete  up-complete LATTICE by A1,A2,WAYBEL13:30;
now
let x2 being (Element of L2),y2 being (Element of L2);
assume that
A6: x2 in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L2 ))
and
A7: y2 in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L2 ))
and
A8:  ex_inf_of { x2,y2 },L2;
x2 is  compact by A6,WAYBEL_8:def 1;
then ( g . x2 ) is  compact by A2,A4,A5,WAYBEL13:28;
then A9: ( g . x2 ) in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L1 )) by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
y2 is  compact by A7,WAYBEL_8:def 1;
then ( g . y2 ) is  compact by A2,A4,A5,WAYBEL13:28;
then A10: ( g . y2 ) in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L1 )) by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
x2 in (the carrier of L2);
then A11: x2 in ( dom g ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A12: ( CompactSublatt L1 ) is  meet-inheriting by A2,WAYBEL_8:def 5;
y2 in (the carrier of L2);
then A13: y2 in ( dom g ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
g is  infs-preserving by A4,WAYBEL13:20;
then A14: g preserves_inf_of { x2,y2 } by WAYBEL_0:def 32;
then  ex_inf_of ( g .: { x2,y2 } ),L1 by A8,WAYBEL_0:def 30;
then  ex_inf_of { ( g . x2 ),( g . y2 ) },L1 by A11,A13,FUNCT_1:60;
then ( inf { ( g . x2 ),( g . y2 ) } ) in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L1 )) by A9,A10,A12,YELLOW_0:def 16;
then A15: ( inf { ( g . x2 ),( g . y2 ) } ) is  compact by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
( g . ( inf { x2,y2 } ) ) = ( inf ( g .: { x2,y2 } ) ) by A8,A14,WAYBEL_0:def 30
.= ( inf { ( g . x2 ),( g . y2 ) } ) by A11,A13,FUNCT_1:60;
then ( inf { x2,y2 } ) is  compact by A2,A4,A5,A15,WAYBEL13:28;
hence ( inf { x2,y2 } ) in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L2 )) by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
end;
then A16: ( CompactSublatt L2 ) is  meet-inheriting by YELLOW_0:def 16;
L2 is  algebraic by A1,A2,WAYBEL13:32;
hence thesis by A16,WAYBEL_8:def 5;
