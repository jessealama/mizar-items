theorem
Th10: (for L1,L2 being  up-complete non empty Poset holds (for f being (Function of L1,L2) holds (f is  isomorphic implies (for x being (Element of L1) holds ( f .: ( waybelow x ) ) = ( waybelow ( f . x ) )))))
proof
let L1 being  up-complete non empty Poset,L2 being  up-complete non empty Poset;
let f being (Function of L1,L2);
assume A1: f is  isomorphic;
then reconsider g = ( (f qua Function) " ) as (Function of L2,L1) by WAYBEL_0:67;
let x being (Element of L1);
A2: ( waybelow ( f . x ) ) c= ( f .: ( waybelow x ) )
proof
let z being set;
assume z in ( waybelow ( f . x ) );
then z in { y where y is (Element of L2): y << ( f . x ) } by WAYBEL_3:def 3;
then consider z1 being (Element of L2) such that A3: z1 = z and A4: z1 << ( f . x );
( g . z1 ) in (the carrier of L1);
then A5: ( g . z1 ) in ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
z1 in (the carrier of L2);
then z1 in ( dom g ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then z1 in ( rng f ) by A1,FUNCT_1:33;
then A6: z1 = ( f . ( g . z1 ) ) by A1,FUNCT_1:35;
then ( g . z1 ) << x by A1,A4,WAYBEL13:27;
then ( g . z1 ) in ( waybelow x ) by WAYBEL_3:7;
hence thesis by A3,A5,A6,FUNCT_1:def 6;
end;
( f .: ( waybelow x ) ) c= ( waybelow ( f . x ) )
proof
let z being set;
assume z in ( f .: ( waybelow x ) );
then consider v being set such that v in ( dom f ) and A7: v in ( waybelow x ) and A8: z = ( f . v ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
v in { y where y is (Element of L1): y << x } by A7,WAYBEL_3:def 3;
then consider v1 being (Element of L1) such that A9: v1 = v and A10: v1 << x;
( f . v1 ) << ( f . x ) by A1,A10,WAYBEL13:27;
hence thesis by A8,A9,WAYBEL_3:7;
end;
hence thesis by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
