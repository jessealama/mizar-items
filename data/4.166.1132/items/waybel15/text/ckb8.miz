theorem
Th9: (for X being set holds ( BoolePoset X ) is  arithmetic)
proof
let X being set;
now
let x being (Element of ( CompactSublatt ( BoolePoset X ) )),y being (Element of ( CompactSublatt ( BoolePoset X ) ));
reconsider x9 = x,y9 = y as (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) by YELLOW_0:58;
x9 is  compact by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
then x9 is  finite by WAYBEL_8:28;
then ( x9 /\ y9 ) is  finite;
then ( x9 "/\" y9 ) is  finite by YELLOW_1:17;
then ( x9 "/\" y9 ) is  compact by WAYBEL_8:28;
then reconsider xy = ( x9 "/\" y9 ) as (Element of ( CompactSublatt ( BoolePoset X ) )) by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
A1:now
let z being (Element of ( CompactSublatt ( BoolePoset X ) ));
reconsider z9 = z as (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) by YELLOW_0:58;
assume that
A2: z <= x
and
A3: z <= y;
z9 <= y9 by A3,YELLOW_0:59;
then A4: z9 c= y9 by YELLOW_1:2;
z9 <= x9 by A2,YELLOW_0:59;
then z9 c= x9 by YELLOW_1:2;
then z9 c= ( x9 /\ y9 ) by A4,XBOOLE_1:19;
then z9 c= ( x9 "/\" y9 ) by YELLOW_1:17;
then z9 <= ( x9 "/\" y9 ) by YELLOW_1:2;
hence xy >= z by YELLOW_0:60;
end;
( x9 /\ y9 ) c= y9 by XBOOLE_1:17;
then ( x9 "/\" y9 ) c= y9 by YELLOW_1:17;
then ( x9 "/\" y9 ) <= y9 by YELLOW_1:2;
then A5: xy <= y by YELLOW_0:60;
( x9 /\ y9 ) c= x9 by XBOOLE_1:17;
then ( x9 "/\" y9 ) c= x9 by YELLOW_1:17;
then ( x9 "/\" y9 ) <= x9 by YELLOW_1:2;
then xy <= x by YELLOW_0:60;
hence  ex_inf_of { x,y },( CompactSublatt ( BoolePoset X ) ) by A5,A1,YELLOW_0:19;
end;
then ( CompactSublatt ( BoolePoset X ) ) is  with_infima by YELLOW_0:21;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_8:19;
end;
