theorem
Th6: (for S,T being non  empty Poset holds (for g being (Function of S,T) holds (for d being (Function of T,S) holds ((g is  onto & [ g,d ] is  Galois) implies T,( Image d ) are_isomorphic ))))
proof
let S being non  empty Poset;
let T being non  empty Poset;
let g being (Function of S,T);
let d being (Function of T,S);
assume that
A1: g is  onto
and
A2: [ g,d ] is  Galois;
d is  one-to-one by A1,A2,WAYBEL_1:24;
then A3: ( (the carrier of ( Image d )) | d ) is  one-to-one by FUNCT_1:58;
A4: d is  monotone by A2,WAYBEL_1:8;
A5:now
let x being (Element of T);
let y being (Element of T);
thus (x <= y implies ( ( corestr d ) . x ) <= ( ( corestr d ) . y )) by A4,WAYBEL_1:def 2;
thus (( ( corestr d ) . x ) <= ( ( corestr d ) . y ) implies x <= y)
proof
(for t being (Element of T) holds ( d . t ) is_minimum_of ( g " { t } )) by A1,A2,WAYBEL_1:22;
then A6: ( g * d ) = ( id T ) by WAYBEL_1:23;
assume A7: ( ( corestr d ) . x ) <= ( ( corestr d ) . y );
y in (the carrier of T);
then A8: y in ( dom d ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A9: g is  monotone by A2,WAYBEL_1:8;
(( d . x ) = ( ( corestr d ) . x ) & ( d . y ) = ( ( corestr d ) . y )) by WAYBEL_1:30;
then ( d . x ) <= ( d . y ) by A7,YELLOW_0:59;
then A10: ( g . ( d . x ) ) <= ( g . ( d . y ) ) by A9,WAYBEL_1:def 2;
x in (the carrier of T);
then x in ( dom d ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( ( g * d ) . x ) <= ( g . ( d . y ) ) by A10,FUNCT_1:13;
then ( ( g * d ) . x ) <= ( ( g * d ) . y ) by A8,FUNCT_1:13;
then ( ( id T ) . x ) <= y by A6,FUNCT_1:18;
hence thesis by FUNCT_1:18;
end;

end;
( rng ( corestr d ) ) = (the carrier of ( Image d )) by FUNCT_2:def 3;
then ( corestr d ) is  isomorphic by A3,A5,WAYBEL_0:66;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_1:def 8;
end;
