theorem
Lm6: (for L being  Boolean LATTICE holds ((L is  complete & (for x being (Element of L) holds (ex X being (Subset of L) st (X c= ( ATOM L ) & x = ( sup X ))))) implies (ex Y being set st L,( BoolePoset Y ) are_isomorphic )))
proof
let L being  Boolean LATTICE;
assume that
A1: L is  complete
and
A2: (for x being (Element of L) holds (ex X being (Subset of L) st (X c= ( ATOM L ) & x = ( sup X ))));
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(ex x9 being (Subset of L) st (x9 = $1 & $2 = ( sup x9 )));
take Y = ( ATOM L );
A3: (for x being (Element of ( BoolePoset Y )) holds (ex y being (Element of L) st P[ x,y ]))
proof
let x being (Element of ( BoolePoset Y ));
x c= Y by WAYBEL_8:26;
then reconsider x9 = x as (Subset of L) by XBOOLE_1:1;
take ( sup x9 );
take x9;
thus thesis;
end;
consider f being (Function of ( BoolePoset Y ),L) such that A4: (for x being (Element of ( BoolePoset Y )) holds P[ x,( f . x ) ]) from FUNCT_2:sch 10(A3);
A5:now
let z being (Element of ( BoolePoset Y )),v being (Element of ( BoolePoset Y ));
consider z9 being (Subset of L) such that A6: z9 = z and A7: ( f . z ) = ( sup z9 ) by A4;
consider v9 being (Subset of L) such that A8: v9 = v and A9: ( f . v ) = ( sup v9 ) by A4;
A10: ( ex_sup_of z9,L &  ex_sup_of v9,L) by A1,YELLOW_0:17;
thus (z <= v implies ( f . z ) <= ( f . v ))
proof
assume z <= v;
then z c= v by YELLOW_1:2;
hence thesis by A6,A7,A8,A9,A10,YELLOW_0:34;
end;

A11: v9 c= ( ATOM L ) by A8,WAYBEL_8:26;
A12: z9 c= ( ATOM L ) by A6,WAYBEL_8:26;
thus (( f . z ) <= ( f . v ) implies z <= v)
proof
assume ( f . z ) <= ( f . v );
then z c= v by A1,A6,A7,A8,A9,A12,A11,CKB34:1;
hence thesis by YELLOW_1:2;
end;

end;
(the carrier of L) c= ( rng f )
proof
let k being set;
assume k in (the carrier of L);
then consider K being (Subset of L) such that A13: K c= ( ATOM L ) and A14: k = ( sup K ) by A2;
A15: K is (Element of ( BoolePoset Y )) by A13,WAYBEL_8:26;
then K in (the carrier of ( BoolePoset Y ));
then A16: K in ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
(ex K9 being (Subset of L) st (K9 = K & ( f . K ) = ( sup K9 ))) by A4,A15;
hence thesis by A14,A16,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;
then A17: ( rng f ) = (the carrier of L) by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
now
let z being (Element of ( BoolePoset Y )),v being (Element of ( BoolePoset Y ));
assume A18: ( f . z ) = ( f . v );
consider z9 being (Subset of L) such that A19: z9 = z and A20: ( f . z ) = ( sup z9 ) by A4;
consider v9 being (Subset of L) such that A21: v9 = v and A22: ( f . v ) = ( sup v9 ) by A4;
A23: v9 c= ( ATOM L ) by A21,WAYBEL_8:26;
z9 c= ( ATOM L ) by A19,WAYBEL_8:26;
then (z c= v & v c= z) by A1,A19,A20,A21,A22,A23,A18,CKB34:1;
hence z = v by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
then f is  one-to-one by WAYBEL_1:def 1;
then f is  isomorphic by A17,A5,WAYBEL_0:66;
then ( BoolePoset Y ),L are_isomorphic  by WAYBEL_1:def 8;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_1:6;
