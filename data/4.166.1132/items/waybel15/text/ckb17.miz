proof
let L being  lower-bounded LATTICE;
given A being  algebraic  lower-bounded LATTICE,g being (Function of A,L) such that
A1: g is  onto
and
A2: g is  infs-preserving
and
A3: g is  directed-sups-preserving;

g is  upper_adjoint by A2,WAYBEL_1:16;
then consider d being (Function of L,A) such that A4: [ g,d ] is  Galois by WAYBEL_1:def 11;
(g is  monotone & d is  monotone) by A4,WAYBEL_1:8;
then ( d * g ) is  monotone by YELLOW_2:12;
then reconsider k = ( d * g ) as  kernel (Function of A,A) by A4,WAYBEL_1:41;
d is  lower_adjoint by A4,WAYBEL_1:9;
then A5: k is  directed-sups-preserving by A3,CKB14:1;
consider X being non  empty set,c being  closure (Function of ( BoolePoset X ),( BoolePoset X )) such that A6: c is  directed-sups-preserving and A7: A,( Image c ) are_isomorphic  by WAYBEL13:35;
consider f being (Function of A,( Image c )) such that A8: f is  isomorphic by A7,WAYBEL_1:def 8;
reconsider f1 = ( (f qua Function) " ) as (Function of ( Image c ),A) by A8,WAYBEL_0:67;
reconsider p = ( ( ( ( ( inclusion c ) * f ) * k ) * f1 ) * ( corestr c ) ) as (Function of ( BoolePoset X ),( BoolePoset X ));
A9: ( f1 * f ) = ( id ( dom f ) ) by A8,FUNCT_1:39
.= ( id A ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A10: f1 is  isomorphic by A8,WAYBEL_0:68;
then ( rng f1 ) = (the carrier of A) by WAYBEL_0:66;
then f1 is  onto by FUNCT_2:def 3;
then A11: ( g * f1 ) is  onto by A1,CKB2:1;
then ( ( g * f1 ) * ( corestr c ) ) is  onto by CKB2:1;

A13: f is  sups-preserving by A8,WAYBEL13:20;
( inclusion c ) is  directed-sups-preserving by A6,CKB16:1;
then ( ( inclusion c ) * f ) is  directed-sups-preserving by A13,CKB14:1;

then A19: p is  idempotent by QUANTAL1:def 9;
( ( inclusion c ) * f ) is  monotone by A8,YELLOW_2:12;
then ( ( ( inclusion c ) * f ) * k ) is  monotone by YELLOW_2:12;
then ( ( ( ( inclusion c ) * f ) * k ) * f1 ) is  monotone by A10,YELLOW_2:12;
then p is  monotone by YELLOW_2:12;
then reconsider p as  projection (Function of ( BoolePoset X ),( BoolePoset X )) by A19,WAYBEL_1:def 13;

[ f1,f ] is  Galois by A8,CKB7:1;
then [ ( g * f1 ),( f * d ) ] is  Galois by A4,CKB6:1;
then A22: L,( Image ( f * d ) ) are_isomorphic  by A11,CKB5:1;
f1 is  sups-preserving by A10,WAYBEL13:20;
then (( corestr c ) is  sups-preserving & ( ( ( ( inclusion c ) * f ) * k ) * f1 ) is  directed-sups-preserving) by A14,CKB14:1,WAYBEL_1:55;
hence p is  directed-sups-preserving by CKB14:1;
( subrelstr ( rng ( f * d ) ) ) is  full  strict  full  strict (SubRelStr of ( BoolePoset X )) by CKB1:1;
