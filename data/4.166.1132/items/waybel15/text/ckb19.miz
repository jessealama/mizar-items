theorem
Th17: (for L being  continuous  complete LATTICE holds (for p being  projection (Function of L,L) holds (p is  directed-sups-preserving implies ( Image p ) is  continuous  continuous LATTICE)))
proof
let L being  continuous  complete LATTICE;
let p being  projection (Function of L,L);
assume that
A1: p is  directed-sups-preserving;
reconsider Lk = { k where k is (Element of L): ( p . k ) <= k } as non  empty (Subset of L) by WAYBEL_1:43;
A2: ( subrelstr Lk ) is  infs-inheriting by WAYBEL_1:50;
reconsider pk = ( p | Lk ) as (Function of ( subrelstr Lk ),( subrelstr Lk )) by WAYBEL_1:46;
A3: pk is  kernel by WAYBEL_1:48;
now
let X being (Subset of ( subrelstr Lk ));
reconsider X9 = X as (Subset of L) by WAYBEL13:3;
assume A4: X is non  empty  directed;
then reconsider X9 as non  empty  directed (Subset of L) by YELLOW_2:7;
A5: p preserves_sup_of X9 by A1,WAYBEL_0:def 37;
now
X c= (the carrier of ( subrelstr Lk ));
then X c= Lk by YELLOW_0:def 15;
then A6: ( pk .: X ) = ( p .: X ) by RELAT_1:129;
assume  ex_sup_of X,( subrelstr Lk );
( subrelstr Lk ) is  infs-inheriting by WAYBEL_1:50;
then ( subrelstr Lk ) is  complete  complete LATTICE by YELLOW_2:30;
hence  ex_sup_of ( pk .: X ),( subrelstr Lk ) by YELLOW_0:17;
A7:  ex_sup_of X,L by YELLOW_0:17;
A8: ( subrelstr Lk ) is  directed-sups-inheriting by A1,WAYBEL_1:52;
then A9: (( dom pk ) = (the carrier of ( subrelstr Lk )) & ( sup X9 ) = ( sup X )) by A4,A7,FUNCT_2:def 1,WAYBEL_0:7;
( ex_sup_of ( p .: X ),L & ( pk .: X ) is  directed  directed (Subset of ( subrelstr Lk ))) by A3,A4,YELLOW_0:17,YELLOW_2:15;
hence ( sup ( pk .: X ) ) = ( sup ( p .: X ) ) by A4,A8,A6,WAYBEL_0:7
.= ( p . ( sup X9 ) ) by A5,A7,WAYBEL_0:def 31
.= ( pk . ( sup X ) ) by A9,FUNCT_1:47;
end;
hence pk preserves_sup_of X by WAYBEL_0:def 31;
end;
then A10: pk is  directed-sups-preserving by WAYBEL_0:def 37;
( subrelstr Lk ) is  directed-sups-inheriting by A1,WAYBEL_1:52;
then A11: ( subrelstr Lk ) is  continuous  continuous LATTICE by A2,WAYBEL_5:28;
A12: (the carrier of ( subrelstr ( rng p ) )) = ( rng p ) by YELLOW_0:def 15
.= ( rng pk ) by WAYBEL_1:44
.= (the carrier of ( subrelstr ( rng pk ) )) by YELLOW_0:def 15;
( subrelstr ( rng pk ) ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of L) by CKB1:1;
then A13: ( Image p ) = ( Image pk ) by A12,YELLOW_0:57;
( subrelstr Lk ) is  complete by A2,YELLOW_2:30;
hence thesis by A11,A3,A13,A10,CKB18:1;
end;
