theorem
Th11: (for L1,L2 being non empty Poset holds ((L1,L2 are_isomorphic  & L1 is  continuous) implies L2 is  continuous))
proof
let L1 being non empty Poset,L2 being non empty Poset;
assume that
A1: L1,L2 are_isomorphic 
and
A2: L1 is  continuous;
consider f being (Function of L1,L2) such that A3: f is  isomorphic by A1,WAYBEL_1:def 8;
reconsider g = ( (f qua Function) " ) as (Function of L2,L1) by A3,WAYBEL_0:67;
A4: (L1 is  up-complete non empty  up-complete non empty Poset & L2 is  up-complete non empty  up-complete non empty Poset) by A1,A2,WAYBEL13:30;
now
let y being (Element of L2);
A5:  ex_sup_of ( waybelow ( g . y ) ),L1 by A2,WAYBEL_0:75;
f is  sups-preserving by A3,WAYBEL13:20;
then A6: f preserves_sup_of ( waybelow ( g . y ) ) by WAYBEL_0:def 33;
y in (the carrier of L2);
then A7: y in ( rng f ) by A3,WAYBEL_0:66;
hence y = ( f . ( g . y ) ) by A3,FUNCT_1:35
.= ( f . ( sup ( waybelow ( g . y ) ) ) ) by A2,WAYBEL_3:def 5
.= ( sup ( f .: ( waybelow ( g . y ) ) ) ) by A6,A5,WAYBEL_0:def 31
.= ( sup ( waybelow ( f . ( g . y ) ) ) ) by A3,A4,CKB10:1
.= ( sup ( waybelow y ) ) by A3,A7,FUNCT_1:35;
end;
then A8: L2 is  satisfying_axiom_of_approximation by WAYBEL_3:def 5;
A9: g is  isomorphic by A3,WAYBEL_0:68;
A10:now
let y being (Element of L2);
(for Y being  finite (Subset of ( waybelow y )) holds (ex z being (Element of L2) st (z in ( waybelow y ) & z is_>=_than Y)))
proof
let Y being  finite (Subset of ( waybelow y ));
Y c= (the carrier of L2) by XBOOLE_1:1;
then A11: Y c= ( rng f ) by A3,WAYBEL_0:66;
now
let u being set;
assume u in ( g .: Y );
then consider v being set such that v in ( dom g ) and A12: v in Y and A13: u = ( g . v ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
v in ( waybelow y ) by A12;
then v in { k where k is (Element of L2): k << y } by WAYBEL_3:def 3;
then consider v1 being (Element of L2) such that A14: v1 = v and A15: v1 << y;
( g . v1 ) << ( g . y ) by A9,A4,A15,WAYBEL13:27;
hence u in ( waybelow ( g . y ) ) by A13,A14,WAYBEL_3:7;
end;
then reconsider X = ( g .: Y ) as  finite (Subset of ( waybelow ( g . y ) )) by TARSKI:def 3;
consider x being (Element of L1) such that A16: x in ( waybelow ( g . y ) ) and A17: x is_>=_than X by A2,WAYBEL_0:1;
y in (the carrier of L2);
then y in ( rng f ) by A3,WAYBEL_0:66;
then A18: ( f . ( g . y ) ) = y by A3,FUNCT_1:35;
take z = ( f . x );
x << ( g . y ) by A16,WAYBEL_3:7;
then z << y by A3,A4,A18,WAYBEL13:27;
hence z in ( waybelow y ) by WAYBEL_3:7;
( f .: X ) = ( f .: ( f " Y ) ) by A3,FUNCT_1:85
.= Y by A11,FUNCT_1:77;
hence thesis by A3,A17,WAYBEL13:19;
end;
hence ( waybelow y ) is non empty  directed by WAYBEL_0:1;
end;
L2 is  up-complete by A1,A2,WAYBEL13:30;
hence thesis by A8,A10,WAYBEL_3:def 6;
end;
