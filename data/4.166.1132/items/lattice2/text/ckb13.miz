theorem
Th17: (((((the L_join of L) is  commutative  associative & (the L_meet of L) is  commutative  associative) & (the L_join of L) absorbs (the L_meet of L)) & (the L_meet of L) absorbs (the L_join of L)) implies L is  Lattice-like)
proof
assume that
A1: (the L_join of L) is  commutative
and
A2: (the L_join of L) is  associative
and
A3: (the L_meet of L) is  commutative
and
A4: (the L_meet of L) is  associative
and
A5: (the L_join of L) absorbs (the L_meet of L)
and
A6: (the L_meet of L) absorbs (the L_join of L);
thus ( a "\/" b ) = ( b "\/" a ) by A1,BINOP_1:def 2;
thus ( a "\/" ( b "\/" c ) ) = ( ( a "\/" b ) "\/" c ) by A2,BINOP_1:def 3;
thus ( ( a "/\" b ) "\/" b ) = b
proof
thus ( ( a "/\" b ) "\/" b ) = ( b "\/" ( a "/\" b ) ) by A1,BINOP_1:def 2
.= ( b "\/" ( b "/\" a ) ) by A3,BINOP_1:def 2
.= b by A5,CKB11:def 1;
end;

thus ( a "/\" b ) = ( b "/\" a ) by A3,BINOP_1:def 2;
thus ( a "/\" ( b "/\" c ) ) = ( ( a "/\" b ) "/\" c ) by A4,BINOP_1:def 3;
let a;
let b;
thus thesis by A6,CKB11:def 1;
end;
