theorem
Th10: ((((u <> v & u <> w) & v <> w) & { u,v,w } is  linearly-independent) iff (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds (( ( ( a * u ) + ( b * v ) ) + ( c * w ) ) = ( 0. V ) implies ((a = ( 0 ) & b = ( 0 )) & c = ( 0 )))))))
proof
thus ((((u <> v & u <> w) & v <> w) & { u,v,w } is  linearly-independent) implies (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds (( ( ( a * u ) + ( b * v ) ) + ( c * w ) ) = ( 0. V ) implies ((a = ( 0 ) & b = ( 0 )) & c = ( 0 )))))))
proof
deffunc F((VECTOR of V)) = ( 0 );
assume that
A1: u <> v
and
A2: u <> w
and
A3: v <> w
and
A4: { u,v,w } is  linearly-independent;
let a;
let b;
let c;
consider f being (Function of (the carrier of V),( REAL )) such that A5: ((( f . u ) = a & ( f . v ) = b) & ( f . w ) = c) and A6: (for x being (VECTOR of V) holds (((x <> u & x <> v) & x <> w) implies ( f . x ) = F(x))) from CKB1:sch 1(A1,A2,A3);
reconsider f as (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of V),( REAL )) )) by FUNCT_2:8;
now
let x being (VECTOR of V);
assume A7: (not x in { u,v,w });
then A8: x <> w by ENUMSET1:def 1;
(x <> u & x <> v) by A7,ENUMSET1:def 1;
hence ( f . x ) = ( 0 ) by A6,A8;
end;
then reconsider f as (Linear_Combination of V) by RLVECT_2:def 3;
( Carrier f ) c= { u,v,w }
proof
let x;
assume A9: x in ( Carrier f );
then ( f . x ) <> ( 0 ) by RLVECT_2:19;
then ((x = u or x = v) or x = w) by A6,A9;
hence thesis by ENUMSET1:def 1;
end;
then reconsider f as (Linear_Combination of { u,v,w }) by RLVECT_2:def 6;
assume ( ( ( a * u ) + ( b * v ) ) + ( c * w ) ) = ( 0. V );
then A10: ( 0. V ) = ( Sum f ) by A1,A2,A3,A5,CKB7:1;
then A11: (not u in ( Carrier f )) by A4,RLVECT_3:def 1;
((not v in ( Carrier f )) & (not w in ( Carrier f ))) by A4,A10,RLVECT_3:def 1;

end;

assume A12: (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds (( ( ( a * u ) + ( b * v ) ) + ( c * w ) ) = ( 0. V ) implies ((a = ( 0 ) & b = ( 0 )) & c = ( 0 ))))));
A13:now
assume A14: ((u = v or u = w) or v = w);
now
per cases  by A14;
suppose u = v;

then ( ( ( 1 * u ) + ( ( - 1 ) * v ) ) + ( ( 0 ) * w ) ) = ( ( u + ( ( - 1 ) * u ) ) + ( ( 0 ) * w ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 8
.= ( ( u + ( - u ) ) + ( ( 0 ) * w ) ) by RLVECT_1:16
.= ( ( u + ( - u ) ) + ( 0. V ) ) by RLVECT_1:10
.= ( u + ( - u ) ) by RLVECT_1:4
.= ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:5;
hence contradiction by A12;
end;
suppose u = w;

then ( ( ( 1 * u ) + ( ( 0 ) * v ) ) + ( ( - 1 ) * w ) ) = ( ( u + ( ( 0 ) * v ) ) + ( ( - 1 ) * u ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 8
.= ( ( u + ( 0. V ) ) + ( ( - 1 ) * u ) ) by RLVECT_1:10
.= ( ( u + ( 0. V ) ) + ( - u ) ) by RLVECT_1:16
.= ( u + ( - u ) ) by RLVECT_1:4
.= ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:5;
hence contradiction by A12;
end;
suppose v = w;

then ( ( ( ( 0 ) * u ) + ( 1 * v ) ) + ( ( - 1 ) * w ) ) = ( ( ( ( 0 ) * u ) + ( 1 * v ) ) + ( - v ) ) by RLVECT_1:16
.= ( ( ( 0. V ) + ( 1 * v ) ) + ( - v ) ) by RLVECT_1:10

.= ( v + ( - v ) ) by RLVECT_1:4
.= ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:5;
hence contradiction by A12;
end;
end;
hence contradiction;
end;
hence ((u <> v & u <> w) & v <> w);
let l being (Linear_Combination of { u,v,w });
assume ( Sum l ) = ( 0. V );
then A15: ( ( ( ( l . u ) * u ) + ( ( l . v ) * v ) ) + ( ( l . w ) * w ) ) = ( 0. V ) by A13,CKB7:1;
then A16: ( l . w ) = ( 0 ) by A12;
A17: (( l . u ) = ( 0 ) & ( l . v ) = ( 0 )) by A12,A15;
thus ( Carrier l ) c= ( {} )
proof
let x;
assume A18: x in ( Carrier l );
( Carrier l ) c= { u,v,w } by RLVECT_2:def 6;
then ((x = u or x = v) or x = w) by A18,ENUMSET1:def 1;
hence thesis by A17,A16,A18,RLVECT_2:19;

thus thesis by XBOOLE_1:2;
