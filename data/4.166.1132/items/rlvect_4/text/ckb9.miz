theorem
Th11: (x in ( Lin { v } ) iff (ex a st x = ( a * v )))
proof
thus (x in ( Lin { v } ) implies (ex a st x = ( a * v )))
proof
assume x in ( Lin { v } );
then consider l being (Linear_Combination of { v }) such that A1: x = ( Sum l ) by RLVECT_3:14;
( Sum l ) = ( ( l . v ) * v ) by RLVECT_2:32;
hence thesis by A1;
end;

given a such that
A2: x = ( a * v );

deffunc F((VECTOR of V)) = ( 0 );
consider f being (Function of (the carrier of V),( REAL )) such that A3: ( f . v ) = a and A4: (for z being (VECTOR of V) holds (z <> v implies ( f . z ) = F(z))) from FUNCT_2:sch 6;
reconsider f as (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of V),( REAL )) )) by FUNCT_2:8;
now
let z being (VECTOR of V);
assume (not z in { v });
then z <> v by TARSKI:def 1;
hence ( f . z ) = ( 0 ) by A4;
end;
then reconsider f as (Linear_Combination of V) by RLVECT_2:def 3;
( Carrier f ) c= { v }
proof
let x;
assume A5: x in ( Carrier f );
then ( f . x ) <> ( 0 ) by RLVECT_2:19;
then x = v by A4,A5;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 1;
end;
then reconsider f as (Linear_Combination of { v }) by RLVECT_2:def 6;
( Sum f ) = x by A2,A3,RLVECT_2:32;
hence thesis by RLVECT_3:14;
