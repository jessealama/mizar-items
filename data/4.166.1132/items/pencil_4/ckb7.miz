let F being Field;
let V being (VectSp of F);
let W1 being (Subspace of V);
let W2 being (Subspace of V);
func segment (W1,W2) -> (Subset of ( Subspaces V ))
means

existence
proof
hereby
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(for W being (Subspace of V) holds (W = $1 implies (W1 is (Subspace of W) & W is (Subspace of W2))));
set A = ( Subspaces V );
assume W1 is (Subspace of W2);
consider X being (Subset of A) such that A1: (for x being set holds (x in X iff (x in A & P[ x ]))) from SUBSET_1:sch 1;
take X;
let W being  strict (Subspace of V);
thus (W in X implies (W1 is (Subspace of W) & W is (Subspace of W2))) by A1;
assume (W1 is (Subspace of W) & W is (Subspace of W2));
then A2: P[ W ];
W in ( Subspaces V ) by VECTSP_5:def 3;
hence W in X by A1,A2;
end;
hereby
reconsider W = ( {} ) as (Subset of ( Subspaces V )) by XBOOLE_1:2;
assume (not W1 is (Subspace of W2));
take W;
thus W = ( {} );
end;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let S being (Subset of ( Subspaces V )),T being (Subset of ( Subspaces V ));
now
assume W1 is (Subspace of W2);
assume that
A3: (for W being  strict (Subspace of V) holds (W in S iff (W1 is (Subspace of W) & W is (Subspace of W2))))
and
A4: (for W being  strict (Subspace of V) holds (W in T iff (W1 is (Subspace of W) & W is (Subspace of W2))));
now
let x being set;
thus (x in S implies x in T)
proof
assume A5: x in S;
then consider x1 being  strict (Subspace of V) such that A6: x1 = x by VECTSP_5:def 3;
(x1 in S iff (W1 is (Subspace of x1) & x1 is (Subspace of W2))) by A3;
hence thesis by A4,A5,A6;
end;

assume A7: x in T;
then consider x1 being  strict (Subspace of V) such that A8: x1 = x by VECTSP_5:def 3;
(x1 in T iff (W1 is (Subspace of x1) & x1 is (Subspace of W2))) by A4;
hence x in S by A3,A7,A8;
end;
hence S = T by TARSKI:1;
end;
hence thesis;
