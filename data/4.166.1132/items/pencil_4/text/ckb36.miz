theorem
Th31: (for F being Field holds (for V being  finite-dimensional (VectSp of F) holds (for m being Nat holds (( m + 1 ) <= ( dim V ) implies ( GrassmannSpace (V,m,( m + 1 )) ) is  identifying_close_blocks))))
proof
let F being Field;
let V being  finite-dimensional (VectSp of F);
let m being Nat;
assume that
A1: ( m + 1 ) <= ( dim V );
set S = ( GrassmannSpace (V,m,( m + 1 )) );
let K being (Block of S);
let L being (Block of S);
A2: (the topology of S) is non  empty by A1,CKB29:1;
then consider W1 being (Subspace of V) such that A3: ( dim W1 ) = ( m + 1 ) and A4: K = ( m Subspaces_of W1 ) by CKB28:def 1;
assume 2 c= ( card ( K /\ L ) );
then consider x,y being set such that A5: x in ( K /\ L ) and A6: y in ( K /\ L ) and A7: x <> y by PENCIL_1:2;
y in K by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider Y being  strict (Subspace of W1) such that A8: y = Y and A9: ( dim Y ) = m by A4,VECTSP_9:def 2;
consider W2 being (Subspace of V) such that A10: ( dim W2 ) = ( m + 1 ) and A11: L = ( m Subspaces_of W2 ) by A2,CKB28:def 1;
y in L by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider Y9 being  strict (Subspace of W2) such that A12: y = Y9 and ( dim Y9 ) = m by A11,VECTSP_9:def 2;
x in L by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider X9 being  strict (Subspace of W2) such that A13: x = X9 and ( dim X9 ) = m by A11,VECTSP_9:def 2;
x in K by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider X being  strict (Subspace of W1) such that A14: x = X and A15: ( dim X ) = m by A4,VECTSP_9:def 2;
reconsider x,y as  strict (Subspace of V) by A14,A8,VECTSP_4:26;
A16:now
reconsider y9 = y as  strict (Subspace of ( x + y )) by VECTSP_5:7;
reconsider x9 = x as  strict (Subspace of ( x + y )) by VECTSP_5:7;
assume A17: ( dim ( x + y ) ) = m;
then ( (Omega). x9 ) = ( (Omega). ( x + y ) ) by A14,A15,VECTSP_9:28;
then x = ( y + x ) by VECTSP_5:5;
then A18: y is (Subspace of x) by VECTSP_5:8;
( (Omega). y9 ) = ( (Omega). ( x + y ) ) by A8,A9,A17,VECTSP_9:28;
then x is (Subspace of y) by VECTSP_5:8;
hence contradiction by A7,A18,VECTSP_4:25;
end;
( x + y ) is (Subspace of W1) by A14,A8,VECTSP_5:34;
then (x is (Subspace of ( x + y )) & ( dim ( x + y ) ) <= ( m + 1 )) by A3,VECTSP_5:7,VECTSP_9:25;
then A19: ( dim ( x + y ) ) = ( m + 1 ) by A14,A15,A16,NAT_1:9,VECTSP_9:25;
( X9 + Y9 ) = ( x + y ) by A13,A12,VECTSP10:12;
then A20: ( (Omega). ( X9 + Y9 ) ) = ( (Omega). W2 ) by A10,A19,VECTSP_9:28;
A21: ( X + Y ) = ( x + y ) by A14,A8,VECTSP10:12;
then ( (Omega). ( X + Y ) ) = ( (Omega). W1 ) by A3,A19,VECTSP_9:28;
hence thesis by A4,A11,A13,A12,A21,A20,CKB30:1,VECTSP10:12;
