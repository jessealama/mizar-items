let F being Field;

func SubspaceSet (V,m,n) -> (Subset-Family of ( m Subspaces_of V )) means

existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex W being (Subspace of V) st (( dim W ) = n & $1 = ( m Subspaces_of W )));
set A = ( bool ( m Subspaces_of V ) );
consider X being set such that A1: (for x being set holds (x in X iff (x in A & P[ x ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
X c= A
proof
let a being set;
assume a in X;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
then reconsider X as (Subset-Family of ( m Subspaces_of V ));
take X;
let x being set;
thus (x in X implies (ex W being (Subspace of V) st (( dim W ) = n & x = ( m Subspaces_of W )))) by A1;
given W being (Subspace of V) such that
A2: ( dim W ) = n
and
A3: x = ( m Subspaces_of W );

x c= ( m Subspaces_of V ) by A3,VECTSP_9:38;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A3;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let S being (Subset-Family of ( m Subspaces_of V ));
let T being (Subset-Family of ( m Subspaces_of V ));
assume that
A4: (for X being set holds (X in S iff (ex W being (Subspace of V) st (( dim W ) = n & X = ( m Subspaces_of W )))))
and
A5: (for X being set holds (X in T iff (ex W being (Subspace of V) st (( dim W ) = n & X = ( m Subspaces_of W )))));
now
let X being set;
thus (X in S implies X in T)
proof
assume X in S;
then (ex W being (Subspace of V) st (( dim W ) = n & X = ( m Subspaces_of W ))) by A4;
hence thesis by A5;
end;

assume X in T;
then (ex W being (Subspace of V) st (( dim W ) = n & X = ( m Subspaces_of W ))) by A5;
hence X in S by A4;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
end;
