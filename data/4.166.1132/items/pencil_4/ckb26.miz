theorem
Th22: (for F being Field holds (for V being  finite-dimensional (VectSp of F) holds (for k being Nat holds ((1 <= k & k < ( dim V )) implies ( PencilSpace (V,k) ) is  identifying_close_blocks))))
proof
let F being Field;
let V being  finite-dimensional (VectSp of F);
let k being Nat;
assume that
A1: 1 <= k
and
A2: k < ( dim V );
set S = ( PencilSpace (V,k) );
thus S is  identifying_close_blocks
proof
let X being (Block of S),Y being (Block of S);
assume 2 c= ( card ( X /\ Y ) );
then consider P being set,Q being set such that A3: (P in ( X /\ Y ) & Q in ( X /\ Y )) and A4: P <> Q by PENCIL_1:2;
A5: (P in X & Q in X) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A6: (P in Y & Q in Y) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A7: S is non void by A1,A2,CKB23:1;
then consider W1 being (Subspace of V),W2 being (Subspace of V) such that A8: W1 is (Subspace of W2) and A9: (( ( dim W1 ) + 1 ) = k & ( dim W2 ) = ( k + 1 )) and A10: X = ( pencil (W1,W2,k) ) by CKB14:def 1;
(the topology of S) is non empty by A7;
then X in (the topology of S);
then reconsider P,Q as (Point of S) by A5;
A11: S is non empty by A2,VECTSP_9:36;
then (ex P1 being  strict (Subspace of V) st (P1 = P & ( dim P1 ) = k)) by VECTSP_9:def 2;
then reconsider P as  strict (Subspace of V);
(ex Q1 being  strict (Subspace of V) st (Q1 = Q & ( dim Q1 ) = k)) by A11,VECTSP_9:def 2;
then reconsider Q as  strict (Subspace of V);
consider U1 being (Subspace of V),U2 being (Subspace of V) such that A12: U1 is (Subspace of U2) and A13: (( ( dim U1 ) + 1 ) = k & ( dim U2 ) = ( k + 1 )) and A14: Y = ( pencil (U1,U2,k) ) by A7,CKB14:def 1;
A15: ( (Omega). W2 ) = ( P + Q ) by A4,A5,A9,A10,CKB16:1
.= ( (Omega). U2 ) by A4,A6,A13,A14,CKB16:1;
( (Omega). W1 ) = ( P /\ Q ) by A4,A5,A9,A10,CKB16:1
.= ( (Omega). U1 ) by A4,A6,A13,A14,CKB16:1;
hence thesis by A8,A10,A12,A14,A15,CKB8:1;
