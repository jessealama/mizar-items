theorem
Th7: (for F being Field holds (for V being (VectSp of F) holds (for W1,W2,W3,W4 being (Subspace of V) holds ((((W1 is (Subspace of W2) & W3 is (Subspace of W4)) & ( (Omega). W1 ) = ( (Omega). W3 )) & ( (Omega). W2 ) = ( (Omega). W4 )) implies ( segment (W1,W2) ) = ( segment (W3,W4) )))))
proof
let F being Field;
let V being (VectSp of F);
let W1 being (Subspace of V),W2 being (Subspace of V),W3 being (Subspace of V),W4 being (Subspace of V);
assume that
A1: W1 is (Subspace of W2)
and
A2: W3 is (Subspace of W4)
and
A3: ( (Omega). W1 ) = ( (Omega). W3 )
and
A4: ( (Omega). W2 ) = ( (Omega). W4 );
thus ( segment (W1,W2) ) c= ( segment (W3,W4) )
proof
let a being set;
assume A5: a in ( segment (W1,W2) );
then (ex A1 being  strict (Subspace of V) st A1 = a) by VECTSP_5:def 3;
then reconsider A = a as  strict (Subspace of V);
A is (Subspace of W2) by A1,A5,CKB7:def 1;
then A is (Subspace of ( (Omega). W2 )) by CKB3:1;
then A6: A is (Subspace of W4) by A4,CKB4:1;
W1 is (Subspace of A) by A1,A5,CKB7:def 1;
then ( (Omega). W1 ) is (Subspace of A) by CKB5:1;
then W3 is (Subspace of A) by A3,CKB6:1;
hence thesis by A2,A6,CKB7:def 1;
end;

let a being set;
assume A7: a in ( segment (W3,W4) );
then (ex A1 being  strict (Subspace of V) st A1 = a) by VECTSP_5:def 3;
then reconsider A = a as  strict (Subspace of V);
A is (Subspace of W4) by A2,A7,CKB7:def 1;
then A is (Subspace of ( (Omega). W4 )) by CKB3:1;
then A8: A is (Subspace of W2) by A4,CKB4:1;
W3 is (Subspace of A) by A2,A7,CKB7:def 1;
then ( (Omega). W3 ) is (Subspace of A) by CKB5:1;
then W1 is (Subspace of A) by A3,CKB6:1;
hence thesis by A1,A8,CKB7:def 1;
