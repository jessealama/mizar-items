defpred P[ (Element of ( NAT )) ]
 means
(for a being (FinSequence of (the carrier of ( RLS_Real ))) holds (for b being (FinSequence of ( REAL )) holds (((( len a ) = $1 & ( len b ) = $1) & (for i being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (i in ( dom a ) implies ( a . i ) = ( b . i )))) implies ( Sum a ) = ( Sum b ))));
A1: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (P[ n ] implies P[ ( n + 1 ) ]))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume A2: P[ n ];
thus P[ ( n + 1 ) ]
proof

A9: (for i being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (i in ( Seg ( n + 1 ) ) implies (( a . i ) = ( a /. i ) & ( a /. i ) = ( b . i ))))
proof
let i being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume A10: i in ( Seg ( n + 1 ) );

A21: P[ ( 0 ) ]
proof
let a being (FinSequence of (the carrier of ( RLS_Real )));
let b being (FinSequence of ( REAL ));
assume that
A22: ( len a ) = ( 0 )
and
A23: ( len b ) = ( 0 )
and
(for i being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (i in ( dom a ) implies ( a . i ) = ( b . i )));
a = ( <*> (the carrier of ( RLS_Real )) ) by A22;
then A24: ( Sum a ) = ( 0. ( RLS_Real ) ) by RLVECT_1:43;
