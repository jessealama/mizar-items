theorem
Th2: (for f,g being Function holds ((for x holds (x in ( ( dom f ) /\ ( dom g ) ) implies ( f . x ) = ( g . x ))) implies (ex h being Function st ( f \/ g ) = h)))
proof
let f being Function,g being Function;
assume that
A1: (for x holds (x in ( ( dom f ) /\ ( dom g ) ) implies ( f . x ) = ( g . x )));
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
[ $1,$2 ] in ( f \/ g );
A2: (for x holds (for y1 holds (for y2 holds ((P[ x,y1 ] & P[ x,y2 ]) implies y1 = y2))))
proof
let x;
let y1;
let y2;
assume that
A3: [ x,y1 ] in ( f \/ g )
and
A4: [ x,y2 ] in ( f \/ g );
now
([ x,y1 ] in f or [ x,y1 ] in g) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then A5: ((x in ( dom f ) & ( f . x ) = y1) or (x in ( dom g ) & ( g . x ) = y1)) by FUNCT_1:1;
A6: ([ x,y2 ] in f or [ x,y2 ] in g) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then A7: ((x in ( dom f ) & ( f . x ) = y2) or (x in ( dom g ) & ( g . x ) = y2)) by FUNCT_1:1;
per cases  by A6,RELAT_1:def 4;
suppose (x in ( dom f ) & x in ( dom g ));

then x in ( ( dom f ) /\ ( dom g ) ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by A1,A5,A7;
end;
suppose (x in ( dom f ) & (not x in ( dom g )));

hence thesis by A6,A5,FUNCT_1:1;
end;
suppose ((not x in ( dom f )) & x in ( dom g ));

hence thesis by A6,A5,FUNCT_1:1;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
consider h being Function such that A8: (for x holds (for y holds ([ x,y ] in h iff (x in ( ( dom f ) \/ ( dom g ) ) & P[ x,y ])))) from FUNCT_1:sch 1(A2);
take h;
let x;
let y;
thus ([ x,y ] in ( f \/ g ) implies [ x,y ] in h)
proof
assume A9: [ x,y ] in ( f \/ g );
then ([ x,y ] in f or [ x,y ] in g) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then (x in ( dom f ) or x in ( dom g )) by RELAT_1:def 4;
then x in ( ( dom f ) \/ ( dom g ) ) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence thesis by A8,A9;
end;

thus thesis by A8;
end;
