theorem
(for I being non empty set holds (for J being  TopSpace-yielding  non-Empty (ManySortedSet of I) holds ((for i being (Element of I) holds ( J . i ) is  compact) implies ( product J ) is  compact)))
proof
let I being non empty set;
let J being  TopSpace-yielding  non-Empty (ManySortedSet of I);
assume A1: (for i being (Element of I) holds ( J . i ) is  compact);
reconsider B = ( product_prebasis J ) as (prebasis of ( product J )) by WAYBEL18:def 3;
assume (not ( product J ) is  compact);
then consider F being (Subset of B) such that A2: ( [#] ( product J ) ) c= ( union F ) and A3: (for G being  finite (Subset of F) holds (not ( [#] ( product J ) ) c= ( union G ))) by CKB17:1;
defpred P[ set,(Element of I) ]
 means
(for G being  finite (Subset of F) holds (not ( ( proj (J,$2) ) " { $1 } ) c= ( union G )));
A4: (for i being (Element of I) holds (ex xi being (Element of ( J . i )) st P[ xi,i ])) by A1,A3,CKB24:1;
consider f being (Element of ( product J )) such that A5: (for i being (Element of I) holds P[ ( f . i ),i ]) from CKB9:sch 1(A4);
f in ( [#] ( product J ) );
then consider A being set such that A6: f in A and A7: A in F by A2,TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider G = { A } as  finite (Subset of F) by A7,ZFMISC_1:31;
consider i being (Element of I),Ai being (Subset of ( J . i )) such that Ai is  open and A8: ( ( proj (J,i) ) " Ai ) = A by A7,CKB18:1;
( ( proj (J,i) ) . f ) in Ai by A6,A8,FUNCT_1:def 7;
then ( f . i ) in Ai by CKB10:1;
then { ( f . i ) } c= Ai by ZFMISC_1:31;
then ( ( proj (J,i) ) " { ( f . i ) } ) c= A by A8,RELAT_1:143;
then ( ( proj (J,i) ) " { ( f . i ) } ) c= ( union G ) by ZFMISC_1:25;
hence contradiction by A5;
