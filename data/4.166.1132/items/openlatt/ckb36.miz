theorem
Th20: (for Z holds (((Z <> ( {} ) & Z c= ( ( SF_have b ) \ ( SF_have a ) )) & Z is  c=-linear) implies (ex Y st (Y in ( ( SF_have b ) \ ( SF_have a ) ) & (for X1 holds (X1 in Z implies X1 c= Y))))))
proof
let Z;
assume that
A1: Z <> ( {} )
and
A2: Z c= ( ( SF_have b ) \ ( SF_have a ) )
and
A3: Z is  c=-linear;
reconsider Z as (Subset-Family of L) by A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
take Y = ( union Z );
Y in ( ( SF_have b ) \ ( SF_have a ) )
proof
set X = the (Element of Z);
A4: (not a in Y)
proof
assume a in Y;
then (ex X st (a in X & X in Z)) by TARSKI:def 4;
hence contradiction by A2,CKB35:1;
end;
X in ( ( SF_have b ) \ ( SF_have a ) ) by A1,A2,TARSKI:def 3;
then A5: b in X by CKB35:1;
then A6: b in Y by A1,TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider Y as non empty (Subset of L) by A1,A5,TARSKI:def 4;
now
let p being (Element of L),q being (Element of L);
thus ((p in Y & q in Y) implies ( p "/\" q ) in Y)
proof
assume p in Y;
then consider X1 such that A7: p in X1 and A8: X1 in Z by TARSKI:def 4;
A9: X1 is (Filter of L) by A2,A8,CKB35:1;
assume q in Y;
then consider X2 such that A10: q in X2 and A11: X2 in Z by TARSKI:def 4;
X1,X2 are_c=-comparable  by A3,A8,A11,ORDINAL1:def 8;
then A12: (X1 c= X2 or X2 c= X1) by XBOOLE_0:def 9;
X2 is (Filter of L) by A2,A11,CKB35:1;
then (( p "/\" q ) in X1 or ( p "/\" q ) in X2) by A7,A10,A9,A12,FILTER_0:8;
hence thesis by A8,A11,TARSKI:def 4;
end;

assume ( p "/\" q ) in Y;
then consider X1 such that A13: ( p "/\" q ) in X1 and A14: X1 in Z by TARSKI:def 4;
A15: X1 is (Filter of L) by A2,A14,CKB35:1;
then A16: q in X1 by A13,FILTER_0:8;
p in X1 by A13,A15,FILTER_0:8;
hence (p in Y & q in Y) by A14,A16,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
then Y is (Filter of L) by FILTER_0:8;
hence thesis by A4,A6,CKB34:1;
end;
hence thesis by ZFMISC_1:74;
