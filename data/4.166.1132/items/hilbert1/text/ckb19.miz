reserve T for (Subset of ( HP-WFF ));
reserve X for (Subset of ( HP-WFF ));
reserve r for (Element of ( HP-WFF ));
definition
let X;
func CnPos X -> (Subset of ( HP-WFF ))
means
:Def11: (r in it iff (for T holds ((T is  Hilbert_theory & X c= T) implies r in T)));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(for T holds ((T is  Hilbert_theory & X c= T) implies $1 in T));
consider Y being set such that A1: (for a being set holds (a in Y iff (a in ( HP-WFF ) & P[ a ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
Y c= ( HP-WFF )
proof
let a being set;
assume a in Y;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
then reconsider Z = Y as (Subset of ( HP-WFF ));
take Z;
thus thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let Y being (Subset of ( HP-WFF )),Z being (Subset of ( HP-WFF ));
assume that
A2: (r in Y iff (for T holds ((T is  Hilbert_theory & X c= T) implies r in T)))
and
A3: (r in Z iff (for T holds ((T is  Hilbert_theory & X c= T) implies r in T)));
(for a being set holds (a in Y iff a in Z))
proof
let a being set;
hereby
assume A4: a in Y;
then reconsider t = a as (Element of ( HP-WFF ));
(for T holds ((T is  Hilbert_theory & X c= T) implies t in T)) by A2,A4;
hence a in Z by A3;
end;
assume A5: a in Z;
then reconsider t = a as (Element of ( HP-WFF ));
(for T holds ((T is  Hilbert_theory & X c= T) implies t in T)) by A3,A5;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
