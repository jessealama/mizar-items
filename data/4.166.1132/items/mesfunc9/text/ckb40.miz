theorem
Th33: ((((F is  additive & F is  with_the_same_dom) & D c= ( dom ( F . ( 0 ) ) )) & x in D) implies ((((( Partial_Sums ( F # x ) ) is  convergent_to_finite_number iff ( ( Partial_Sums F ) # x ) is  convergent_to_finite_number) & (( Partial_Sums ( F # x ) ) is  convergent_to_+infty iff ( ( Partial_Sums F ) # x ) is  convergent_to_+infty)) & (( Partial_Sums ( F # x ) ) is  convergent_to_-infty iff ( ( Partial_Sums F ) # x ) is  convergent_to_-infty)) & (( Partial_Sums ( F # x ) ) is  convergent iff ( ( Partial_Sums F ) # x ) is  convergent)))
proof
set PFx = ( Partial_Sums ( F # x ) );
set PF = ( Partial_Sums F );
assume that
A1: F is  additive
and
A2: F is  with_the_same_dom
and
A3: D c= ( dom ( F . ( 0 ) ) )
and
A4: x in D;
thus A5:now
assume PFx is  convergent_to_finite_number;
then consider g being  real number such that A6: (for p being  real number holds (( 0 ) < p implies (ex n being Nat st (for m being Nat holds (n <= m implies |. ( ( PFx . m ) - ( R_EAL g ) ) .| < p))))) by MESFUNC5:def 8;
now
let p being  real number;

take n;
let m being Nat;
assume A8: n <= m;
( PFx . m ) = ( ( PF # x ) . m ) by A1,A2,A3,A4,CKB39:1;
hence |. ( ( ( PF # x ) . m ) - ( R_EAL g ) ) .| < p by A7,A8;
end;
hence ( PF # x ) is  convergent_to_finite_number by MESFUNC5:def 8;
end;
thus A9:now
assume ( PF # x ) is  convergent_to_finite_number;
then consider g being  real number such that A10: (for p being  real number holds (( 0 ) < p implies (ex n being Nat st (for m being Nat holds (n <= m implies |. ( ( ( PF # x ) . m ) - ( R_EAL g ) ) .| < p))))) by MESFUNC5:def 8;

now
