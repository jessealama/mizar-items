theorem
Th15: (for x,y,z being (Element of ( REAL )) holds ( * (x,( * (y,z) )) ) = ( * (( * (x,y) ),z) ))
proof
let x being (Element of ( REAL )),y being (Element of ( REAL )),z being (Element of ( REAL ));

then A5: (ex xy99,z99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((( * (x,y) ) = xy99 & z = z99) & ( * (( * (x,y) ),z) ) = ( xy99 *' z99 ))) by A3,CKB11:def 1;
