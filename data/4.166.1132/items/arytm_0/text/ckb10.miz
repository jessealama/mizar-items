uniqueness
proof
let IT1 being (Element of ( REAL )),IT2 being (Element of ( REAL ));
thus ((((x in ( REAL+ ) & y in ( REAL+ )) & (ex x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = x9 & y = y9) & IT1 = ( x9 + y9 )))) & (ex x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = x9 & y = y9) & IT2 = ( x9 + y9 )))) implies IT1 = IT2);
thus ((((x in ( REAL+ ) & y in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]) & (ex x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = x9 & y = [ ( 0 ),y9 ]) & IT1 = ( x9 - y9 )))) & (ex x99,y99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = x99 & y = [ ( 0 ),y99 ]) & IT2 = ( x99 - y99 )))) implies IT1 = IT2) by ZFMISC_1:27;
thus ((((y in ( REAL+ ) & x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]) & (ex x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = [ ( 0 ),x9 ] & y = y9) & IT1 = ( y9 - x9 )))) & (ex x99,y99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = [ ( 0 ),x99 ] & y = y99) & IT2 = ( y99 - x99 )))) implies IT1 = IT2) by ZFMISC_1:27;
assume that
(not (x in ( REAL+ ) & y in ( REAL+ )))
and
(not (x in ( REAL+ ) & y in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))
and
(not (y in ( REAL+ ) & x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]));
given x9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )),y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that
A18: x = [ ( 0 ),x9 ]
and
A19: (y = [ ( 0 ),y9 ] & IT1 = [ ( 0 ),( x9 + y9 ) ]);

given x99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )),y99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that
A20: x = [ ( 0 ),x99 ]
and
A21: (y = [ ( 0 ),y99 ] & IT2 = [ ( 0 ),( x99 + y99 ) ]);

x9 = x99 by A18,A20,ZFMISC_1:27;
hence thesis by A19,A21,ZFMISC_1:27;
