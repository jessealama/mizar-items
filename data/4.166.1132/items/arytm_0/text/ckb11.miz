uniqueness
proof
let IT1 being (Element of ( REAL )),IT2 being (Element of ( REAL ));
thus ((((x in ( REAL+ ) & y in ( REAL+ )) & (ex x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = x9 & y = y9) & IT1 = ( x9 *' y9 )))) & (ex x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = x9 & y = y9) & IT2 = ( x9 *' y9 )))) implies IT1 = IT2);
thus (((((x in ( REAL+ ) & y in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]) & x <> ( 0 )) & (ex x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = x9 & y = [ ( 0 ),y9 ]) & IT1 = [ ( 0 ),( x9 *' y9 ) ]))) & (ex x99,y99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = x99 & y = [ ( 0 ),y99 ]) & IT2 = [ ( 0 ),( x99 *' y99 ) ]))) implies IT1 = IT2) by ZFMISC_1:27;
thus (((((y in ( REAL+ ) & x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]) & y <> ( 0 )) & (ex x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = [ ( 0 ),x9 ] & y = y9) & IT1 = [ ( 0 ),( y9 *' x9 ) ]))) & (ex x99,y99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = [ ( 0 ),x99 ] & y = y99) & IT2 = [ ( 0 ),( y99 *' x99 ) ]))) implies IT1 = IT2) by ZFMISC_1:27;
hereby
assume that
x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]
and
y in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :];
given x9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )),y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that
A36: x = [ ( 0 ),x9 ]
and
A37: (y = [ ( 0 ),y9 ] & IT1 = ( y9 *' x9 ));

given x99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )),y99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that
A38: x = [ ( 0 ),x99 ]
and
A39: (y = [ ( 0 ),y99 ] & IT2 = ( y99 *' x99 ));

x9 = x99 by A36,A38,ZFMISC_1:27;
hence IT1 = IT2 by A37,A39,ZFMISC_1:27;
