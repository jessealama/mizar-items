theorem
((X is  finite & X c= [: Y,Z :]) implies (ex A,B being set st ((((A is  finite & A c= Y) & B is  finite) & B c= Z) & X c= [: A,B :])))
proof
deffunc G(set) = ( $1 `2 );
assume that
A1: X is  finite
and
A2: X c= [: Y,Z :];
consider f being Function such that A3: ( dom f ) = X and A4: (for a holds (a in X implies ( f . a ) = F(a))) from FUNCT_1:sch 3;
consider g being Function such that A5: ( dom g ) = X and A6: (for a holds (a in X implies ( g . a ) = G(a))) from FUNCT_1:sch 3;
take A = ( rng f );
take B = ( rng g );
thus A is  finite by A1,A3,CKB35:1;
thus A c= Y
proof
let a;
assume a in A;
then consider x being set such that A7: x in ( dom f ) and A8: ( f . x ) = a by FUNCT_1:def 3;
consider y,z being set such that A9: y in Y and z in Z and A10: x = [ y,z ] by A2,A3,A7,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
( f . x ) = ( x `1 ) by A3,A4,A7
.= y by A10,MCART_1:7;
hence thesis by A8,A9;
end;

thus B is  finite by A1,A5,CKB35:1;
thus B c= Z
proof
let a;
assume a in B;
then consider x being set such that A11: x in ( dom g ) and A12: ( g . x ) = a by FUNCT_1:def 3;
consider y,z being set such that y in Y and A13: z in Z and A14: x = [ y,z ] by A2,A5,A11,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
( g . x ) = ( x `2 ) by A5,A6,A11
.= z by A14,MCART_1:7;
hence thesis by A12,A13;
end;

thus X c= [: A,B :]
proof
let a;
assume A15: a in X;
then consider x,y being set such that x in Y and y in Z and A16: a = [ x,y ] by A2,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
A17: ( g . a ) = ( a `2 ) by A6,A15
.= y by A16,MCART_1:7;
( f . a ) = ( a `1 ) by A4,A15
.= x by A16,MCART_1:7;
then A18: x in A by A3,A15,FUNCT_1:def 3;
y in B by A5,A15,A17,FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A16,A18,ZFMISC_1:87;
