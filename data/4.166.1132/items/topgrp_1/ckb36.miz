theorem
Th25: (for S,T being non empty TopStruct holds (for f being (Function of S,T) holds (f is  being_homeomorphism iff (((( dom f ) = ( [#] S ) & ( rng f ) = ( [#] T )) & f is  one-to-one) & (for P being (Subset of S) holds (P is  open iff ( f .: P ) is  open))))))
proof
let S being non empty TopStruct,T being non empty TopStruct;
let f being (Function of S,T);
A1: ( [#] T ) <> ( {} );
A2: ( [#] S ) <> ( {} );
hereby
assume A3: f is  being_homeomorphism;
hence A4: ((( dom f ) = ( [#] S ) & ( rng f ) = ( [#] T )) & f is  one-to-one) by TOPS_2:def 5;
let P being (Subset of S);
A5: (( f " ( f .: P ) ) c= P & P c= ( f " ( f .: P ) )) by A4,FUNCT_1:76,FUNCT_1:82;
A6: ( f /" ) is  continuous by A3,TOPS_2:def 5;
hereby
assume A7: P is  open;
f is  onto by A4,FUNCT_2:def 3;
then ( ( f /" ) " P ) = ( ( (f qua Function) " ) " P ) by A4,TOPS_2:def 4
.= ( f .: P ) by A4,FUNCT_1:84;
hence ( f .: P ) is  open by A2,A6,A7,TOPS_2:43;
end;
assume A8: ( f .: P ) is  open;
f is  continuous by A3,TOPS_2:def 5;
then ( f " ( f .: P ) ) is  open by A1,A8,TOPS_2:43;
hence P is  open by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
assume that
A9: ( dom f ) = ( [#] S )
and
A10: ( rng f ) = ( [#] T )
and
A11: f is  one-to-one
and
A12: (for P being (Subset of S) holds (P is  open iff ( f .: P ) is  open));
now
let B being (Subset of T);
assume that
A13: B is  open;
B = ( f .: ( f " B ) ) by A10,FUNCT_1:77;
hence ( f " B ) is  open by A12,A13;
end;
then A14: f is  continuous by A1,TOPS_2:43;
now
let B being (Subset of S);
assume that
A15: B is  open;
f is  onto by A10,FUNCT_2:def 3;
then ( ( f /" ) " B ) = ( ( (f qua Function) " ) " B ) by A11,TOPS_2:def 4
.= ( f .: B ) by A11,FUNCT_1:84;
hence ( ( f /" ) " B ) is  open by A12,A15;
end;
then ( f /" ) is  continuous by A2,TOPS_2:43;
hence thesis by A9,A10,A11,A14,TOPS_2:def 5;
end;
