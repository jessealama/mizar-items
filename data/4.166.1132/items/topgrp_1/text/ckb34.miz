theorem
(for S,T being non  empty TopSpace holds (for f being (Function of S,T) holds ((for p being (Point of S) holds (for P being  open (a_neighborhood of p) holds (ex R being (a_neighborhood of ( f . p )) st R c= ( f .: P )))) implies f is  open)))
proof
let S being non  empty TopSpace;
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
let f being (Function of S,T);
assume that
A1: (for p being (Point of S) holds (for P being  open (a_neighborhood of p) holds (ex R being (a_neighborhood of ( f . p )) st R c= ( f .: P ))));
let A being (Subset of S);
assume that
A2: A is  open;
(for x being set holds (x in ( f .: A ) iff (ex Q being (Subset of T) st ((Q is  open & Q c= ( f .: A )) & x in Q))))
proof
let x being set;
hereby
assume x in ( f .: A );
then consider a being set such that A3: a in ( dom f ) and A4: a in A and A5: x = ( f . a ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
reconsider p = a as (Point of S) by A3;
consider V being (Subset of S) such that A6: V is  open and A7: V c= A and A8: a in V by A2,A4;
V is (a_neighborhood of p) by A6,A8,CONNSP_2:3;
then consider R being (a_neighborhood of ( f . p )) such that A9: R c= ( f .: V ) by A1,A6;
take K = ( Int R );
( Int R ) c= R by TOPS_1:16;
then A10: K c= ( f .: V ) by A9,XBOOLE_1:1;
thus K is  open;
( f .: V ) c= ( f .: A ) by A7,RELAT_1:123;
hence K c= ( f .: A ) by A10,XBOOLE_1:1;
thus x in K by A5,CONNSP_2:def 1;
end;
thus thesis;
end;
hence thesis by TOPS_1:25;
