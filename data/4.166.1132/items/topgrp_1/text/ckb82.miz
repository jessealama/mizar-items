theorem
(for T being TopGroup holds ((for a,b being (Element of T) holds (for W being (a_neighborhood of ( a * ( b " ) )) holds (ex A being (a_neighborhood of a) st (ex B being (a_neighborhood of b) st ( A * ( B " ) ) c= W)))) implies T is TopologicalGroup))
proof
let T being TopGroup;
assume that
A1: (for a,b being (Element of T) holds (for W being (a_neighborhood of ( a * ( b " ) )) holds (ex A being (a_neighborhood of a) st (ex B being (a_neighborhood of b) st ( A * ( B " ) ) c= W))));
A2: (for a being (Element of T) holds (for W being (a_neighborhood of ( a " )) holds (ex A being (a_neighborhood of a) st ( A " ) c= W)))
proof
let a being (Element of T);
let W being (a_neighborhood of ( a " ));
W is (a_neighborhood of ( ( 1_ T ) * ( a " ) )) by GROUP_1:def 4;
then consider A being (a_neighborhood of ( 1_ T )),B being (a_neighborhood of a) such that A3: ( A * ( B " ) ) c= W by A1;
take B;
let x being set;
assume A4: x in ( B " );
then consider g being (Element of T) such that A5: x = ( g " ) and g in B;
( 1_ T ) in A by CONNSP_2:4;
then ( ( 1_ T ) * ( g " ) ) in ( A * ( B " ) ) by A4,A5;
then ( g " ) in ( A * ( B " ) ) by GROUP_1:def 4;
