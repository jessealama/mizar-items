theorem
(for S,T being non  empty TopStruct holds (for f being (Function of S,T) holds (f is  being_homeomorphism iff (((( dom f ) = ( [#] S ) & ( rng f ) = ( [#] T )) & f is  one-to-one) & (for P being (Subset of T) holds (P is  closed iff ( f " P ) is  closed))))))
proof
let S being non  empty TopStruct;
let T being non  empty TopStruct;
let f being (Function of S,T);
hereby
assume A1: f is  being_homeomorphism;
hence A2: ((( dom f ) = ( [#] S ) & ( rng f ) = ( [#] T )) & f is  one-to-one) by TOPS_2:def 5;
let P being (Subset of T);
hereby
assume A3: P is  closed;
f is  continuous by A1,TOPS_2:def 5;
hence ( f " P ) is  closed by A3,PRE_TOPC:def 6;
end;
assume ( f " P ) is  closed;
then ( f .: ( f " P ) ) is  closed by A1,TOPS_2:58;
hence P is  closed by A2,FUNCT_1:77;
end;
assume that
A4: ( dom f ) = ( [#] S )
and
A5: ( rng f ) = ( [#] T )
and
A6: f is  one-to-one
and
A7: (for P being (Subset of T) holds (P is  closed iff ( f " P ) is  closed));
thus ((( dom f ) = ( [#] S ) & ( rng f ) = ( [#] T )) & f is  one-to-one) by A4,A5,A6;
thus f is  continuous
proof
let P being (Subset of T);
thus thesis by A7;
end;

let R being (Subset of S);
assume that
A8: R is  closed;
(for x1,x2 being (Element of S) holds ((x1 in R & ( f . x1 ) = ( f . x2 )) implies x2 in R)) by A4,A6,FUNCT_1:def 4;
then A9: ( f " ( f .: R ) ) = R by T_0TOPSP:1;
( ( f /" ) " R ) = ( f .: R ) by A5,A6,TOPS_2:54;
hence thesis by A7,A8,A9;
end;
