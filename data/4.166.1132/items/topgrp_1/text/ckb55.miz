definition
let T being TopStruct;
func HomeoGroup T ->  strict multMagma means 
:Def5: ((x in (the carrier of it) iff x is (Homeomorphism of T)) & (for f,g being (Homeomorphism of T) holds ( (the multF of it) . (f,g) ) = ( g * f )));
existence
proof
defpred X[ set ]
 means
$1 is (Homeomorphism of T);
consider A being set such that A1: (for q being set holds (q in A iff (q in ( Funcs ((the carrier of T),(the carrier of T)) ) & X[ q ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
A2:now
let f being (Homeomorphism of T);
f in ( Funcs ((the carrier of T),(the carrier of T)) ) by FUNCT_2:9;
hence f in A by A1;
end;
then reconsider A as non  empty set;
defpred P[ (Element of A),(Element of A),(Element of A) ]
 means
(ex f,g being (Homeomorphism of T) st (($1 = f & $2 = g) & $3 = ( g * f )));
A3: (for x,y being (Element of A) holds (ex z being (Element of A) st P[ x,y,z ]))
proof
let x being (Element of A);
let y being (Element of A);
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y as (Homeomorphism of T) by A1;
( y1 * x1 ) is (Homeomorphism of T) by CKB54:1;
then reconsider z = ( y1 * x1 ) as (Element of A) by A2;
take z;
take x1;
take y1;
thus thesis;
end;
consider o being (BinOp of A) such that A4: (for a,b being (Element of A) holds P[ a,b,( o . (a,b) ) ]) from BINOP_1:sch 3(A3);
take G = multMagma (# A,o #);
let x;
thus (x in (the carrier of G) iff x is (Homeomorphism of T)) by A1,A2;
let f being (Homeomorphism of T);
let g being (Homeomorphism of T);
reconsider f1 = f,g1 = g as (Element of A) by A2;
(ex m,n being (Homeomorphism of T) st ((f1 = m & g1 = n) & ( o . (f1,g1) ) = ( n * m ))) by A4;
hence thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
defpred X[ set ]
 means
$1 is (Homeomorphism of T);
let A being  strict multMagma;
let B being  strict multMagma;
assume that
A5: ((x in (the carrier of A) iff x is (Homeomorphism of T)) & (for f,g being (Homeomorphism of T) holds ( (the multF of A) . (f,g) ) = ( g * f )))
and
A6: ((x in (the carrier of B) iff x is (Homeomorphism of T)) & (for f,g being (Homeomorphism of T) holds ( (the multF of B) . (f,g) ) = ( g * f )));
A7: (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of B) iff X[ x ])) by A6;
A8: (for c,d being set holds ((c in (the carrier of A) & d in (the carrier of A)) implies ( (the multF of A) . (c,d) ) = ( (the multF of B) . (c,d) )))
proof
let c being set;
let d being set;
assume (c in (the carrier of A) & d in (the carrier of A));
then reconsider f = c,g = d as (Homeomorphism of T) by A5;
thus ( (the multF of A) . (c,d) ) = ( g * f ) by A5
.= ( (the multF of B) . (c,d) ) by A6;
end;
A9: (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of A) iff X[ x ])) by A5;
(the carrier of A) = (the carrier of B) from XBOOLE_0:sch 2(A9,A7);
hence thesis by A8,BINOP_1:1;
