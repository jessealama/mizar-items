theorem
Th6: (for F being (Function of [: ( R^1 ),( I[01] ) :],( R^1 )) holds ((for x being (Point of ( R^1 )) holds (for i being (Point of ( I[01] )) holds ( F . (x,i) ) = ( ( 1 - i ) * x ))) implies F is  continuous))
proof
deffunc Fa((Element of ( TOP-REAL 1 )),(Element of I)) = ( ( 1 - $2 ) * $1 );
consider G being (Function of [: (the carrier of ( TOP-REAL 1 )),I :],(the carrier of ( TOP-REAL 1 ))) such that A1: (for x being (Point of ( TOP-REAL 1 )) holds (for i being (Point of ( I[01] )) holds ( G . (x,i) ) = Fa(x,i))) from BINOP_1:sch 4;

A3: f is  being_homeomorphism by A2,JORDAN2B:28;
then A4: f is  continuous by TOPS_2:def 5;
let F being (Function of [: ( R^1 ),( I[01] ) :],( R^1 ));
assume that
A5: (for x being (Point of ( R^1 )) holds (for i being (Point of ( I[01] )) holds ( F . (x,i) ) = ( ( 1 - i ) * x )));
A6: (for x being (Point of [: ( R^1 ),( I[01] ) :]) holds ( F . x ) = ( ( f * ( G * [: ( f " ),( id ( I[01] ) ) :] ) ) . x ))
proof
reconsider ff = f as Function;

consider z being Real such that A11: ( ( 1 - b ) * ( ( f " ) . a ) ) = <* z *> by JORDAN2B:20;
A12: <* a *> = |[ a ]|;
then reconsider w = <* a *> as (Element of ( REAL 1 )) by EUCLID:22;
A13: ff is  one-to-one by A3,TOPS_2:def 5;
( f . <* a *> ) = ( |[ a ]| /. 1 ) by A2
.= a by CKB13:1;
then <* a *> = ( g . a ) by A10,A13,A12,FUNCT_1:32;

thus ( ( f * ( G * [: ( f " ),( id ( I[01] ) ) :] ) ) . x ) = ( f . ( ( G * [: ( f " ),( id ( I[01] ) ) :] ) . x ) ) by FUNCT_2:15

.= ( F . (a,b) ) by A5
.= ( F . x ) by A7;
end;
( f " ) is  continuous by A3,TOPS_2:def 5;
then A16: [: ( f " ),( id ( I[01] ) ) :] is  continuous;
G is  continuous by A1,TOPALG_1:17;
hence thesis by A4,A16,A6,FUNCT_2:63;
