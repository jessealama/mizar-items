A120: (for l,m,k1,k2 being Nat holds (((((1 <= l & l < m) & m <= ( len f )) & k1 = ( f . l )) & k2 = ( f . m )) implies k1 < k2))
proof
let l being Nat;
let m being Nat;
let k1 being Nat;
let k2 being Nat;
assume that
A121: 1 <= l
and
A122: l < m
and
A123: m <= ( len f )
and
A124: k1 = ( f . l )
and
A125: k2 = ( f . m );
A126: m <= ( len q ) by A59,A60,A123,NAT_1:13;
l <= n by A60,A122,A123,XXREAL_0:2;
then A127: l in ( Seg n ) by A121,CKB3:1;
1 <= m by A121,A122,XXREAL_0:2;
then A128: m in ( Seg n ) by A60,A123,CKB3:1;

A130: m in ( dom q9 ) by A60,A128,CKB24:def 1;
A131: k1 = ( q . l ) by A61,A124,A129;
