theorem
Th11: { A where A is (a_partition of (the carrier of T)): A is  closed } is (Part-Family of (the carrier of T))
proof
set S = { A where A is (a_partition of (the carrier of T)): A is  closed };
A1:now
let B being set;
assume B in { A where A is (a_partition of (the carrier of T)): A is  closed };
then (ex A being (a_partition of (the carrier of T)) st (B = A & A is  closed));
hence B is (a_partition of (the carrier of T));
end;
S c= ( bool ( bool (the carrier of T) ) )
proof
let B being set;
assume B in S;
then (ex A being (a_partition of (the carrier of T)) st (B = A & A is  closed));
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by A1,EQREL_1:def 7;
