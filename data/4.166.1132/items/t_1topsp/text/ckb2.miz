theorem
Th5: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (for S being non  empty (a_partition of (the carrier of T)) holds (for A being (Subset of ( space S )) holds (for B being (Subset of T) holds (B = ( union A ) implies (A is  closed iff B is  closed))))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
let S being non  empty (a_partition of (the carrier of T));
let A being (Subset of ( space S ));
let B being (Subset of T);
reconsider C = A as (Subset of S) by BORSUK_1:def 7;
A1: ( ( [#] T ) \ ( union A ) ) = ( ( union S ) \ ( union C ) ) by EQREL_1:def 4
.= ( union ( S \ A ) ) by EQREL_1:43
.= ( union ( ( [#] ( space S ) ) \ A ) ) by BORSUK_1:def 7;
assume A2: B = ( union A );
thus (A is  closed implies B is  closed)
proof
reconsider om = ( ( [#] ( space S ) ) \ A ) as (Subset of S) by BORSUK_1:def 7;
assume A is  closed;
then ( ( [#] ( space S ) ) \ A ) is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 3;
then om in (the topology of ( space S )) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then ( ( [#] T ) \ B ) in (the topology of T) by A2,A1,BORSUK_1:27;
then ( ( [#] T ) \ B ) is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
hence thesis by PRE_TOPC:def 3;
end;

thus (B is  closed implies A is  closed)
proof
reconsider om = ( ( [#] ( space S ) ) \ A ) as (Subset of S) by BORSUK_1:def 7;
assume B is  closed;

then ( ( [#] T ) \ ( union A ) ) in (the topology of T) by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then om in (the topology of ( space S )) by A1,BORSUK_1:27;
then ( ( [#] ( space S ) ) \ A ) is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
