theorem
Th12: (for T being non empty TopSpace holds ( T_1-reflex T ) is  T_1)
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
now
let p being (Point of ( T_1-reflex T ));
reconsider I = ( ( Intersection ( Closed_Partitions T ) ) \ { p } ) as (Subset of ( Intersection ( Closed_Partitions T ) )) by XBOOLE_1:36;
A1: (the carrier of ( T_1-reflex T )) = ( Intersection ( Closed_Partitions T ) ) by BORSUK_1:def 7;
then consider x being (Element of T) such that A2: p = ( EqClass (x,( Intersection ( Closed_Partitions T ) )) ) by EQREL_1:42;
reconsider q = p as (Subset of T) by A2;
A3: { ( EqClass (x,S) ) where S is (a_partition of (the carrier of T)): S in ( Closed_Partitions T ) } c= ( bool (the carrier of T) )
proof
let Z being set;
assume Z in { ( EqClass (x,S) ) where S is (a_partition of (the carrier of T)): S in ( Closed_Partitions T ) };
then (ex Y being (a_partition of (the carrier of T)) st (Z = ( EqClass (x,Y) ) & Y in ( Closed_Partitions T )));
hence thesis;
end;
{ ( EqClass (x,S) ) where S is (a_partition of (the carrier of T)): S in ( Closed_Partitions T ) } is non empty
proof
consider Y being set such that A4: Y in ( Closed_Partitions T ) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
reconsider Y as (a_partition of (the carrier of T)) by A4,EQREL_1:def 7;
( EqClass (x,Y) ) in { ( EqClass (x,S) ) where S is (a_partition of (the carrier of T)): S in ( Closed_Partitions T ) } by A4;
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider m = { ( EqClass (x,S) ) where S is (a_partition of (the carrier of T)): S in ( Closed_Partitions T ) } as non empty (Subset-Family of T) by A3;
reconsider m as non empty (Subset-Family of T);
A5: (for A being (Subset of T) holds (A in m implies A is  closed))
proof
let A being (Subset of T);
assume A in m;
then consider S being (a_partition of (the carrier of T)) such that A6: (A = ( EqClass (x,S) ) & S in ( Closed_Partitions T ));
((ex B being (a_partition of (the carrier of T)) st (S = B & B is  closed)) & A in S) by A6,EQREL_1:def 6;
hence thesis by TOPS_2:def 2;
end;
p = ( meet { ( EqClass (x,S) ) where S is (a_partition of (the carrier of T)): S in ( Closed_Partitions T ) } ) by A2,EQREL_1:def 8;
then q is  closed by A5,PRE_TOPC:14;
then ( ( [#] T ) \ q ) is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 3;
then A7: ( ( [#] T ) \ p ) in (the topology of T) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
p in ( Intersection ( Closed_Partitions T ) ) by A1;
then ( union ( ( Intersection ( Closed_Partitions T ) ) \ { p } ) ) in (the topology of T) by A7,EQREL_1:44;
then A8: I in { A where A is (Subset of ( Intersection ( Closed_Partitions T ) )): ( union A ) in (the topology of T) };
reconsider I as (Subset of ( space ( Intersection ( Closed_Partitions T ) ) )) by BORSUK_1:def 7;
reconsider I as (Subset of ( T_1-reflex T ));
((the topology of ( space ( Intersection ( Closed_Partitions T ) ) )) = { A where A is (Subset of ( Intersection ( Closed_Partitions T ) )): ( union A ) in (the topology of T) } & I = ( ( [#] ( T_1-reflex T ) ) \ { p } )) by BORSUK_1:def 7;
then ( ( [#] ( T_1-reflex T ) ) \ { p } ) is  open by A8,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
hence { p } is  closed by PRE_TOPC:def 3;
end;
hence thesis by URYSOHN1:19;
