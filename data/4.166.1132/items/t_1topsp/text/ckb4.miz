reserve T for non  empty TopSpace;
definition
let T;
func Closed_Partitions T -> non  empty (Part-Family of (the carrier of T)) equals 
{ A where A is (a_partition of (the carrier of T)): A is  closed };
coherence
proof
reconsider ct = { (the carrier of T) } as (a_partition of (the carrier of T)) by EQREL_1:39;
set F = { A where A is (a_partition of (the carrier of T)): A is  closed };
(for A being (Subset of T) holds (A in ct implies A is  closed))
proof
let A being (Subset of T);
assume A in ct;
then A = ( [#] T ) by TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis;
end;
then ct is  closed by TOPS_2:def 2;
then ct in F;
hence thesis by CKB3:1;
end;
