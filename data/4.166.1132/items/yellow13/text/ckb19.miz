theorem
(for N being  finite LATTICE holds N,( InclPoset ( Ids N ) ) are_isomorphic )
proof
let N being  finite LATTICE;
set I = ( InclPoset ( Ids N ) );
take i = ( IdsMap N );
((N is non  empty & I is non  empty) implies (i is  one-to-one  monotone & (ex s being (Function of I,N) st (s = ( i " ) & s is  monotone))))
proof
assume that
N is non  empty
and
I is non  empty;
thus i is  one-to-one  monotone;
take s = ( SupMap N );
[ i,s ] is  Galois by WAYBEL_1:57;
then i is  onto by WAYBEL_1:24;
then A1: ( rng i ) = (the carrier of I) by FUNCT_2:def 3;
A2: (for y,x being set holds ((y in ( rng i ) & x = ( s . y )) iff (x in ( dom i ) & y = ( i . x ))))
proof
let y being set;
let x being set;
A3: ( dom i ) = (the carrier of N) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hereby
assume that
A4: y in ( rng i )
and
A5: x = ( s . y );
reconsider Y = y as (Element of I) by A4;
x = ( s . Y ) by A5;
hence x in ( dom i ) by A3;
reconsider Y1 = Y as (Ideal of N) by YELLOW_2:41;
thus ( i . x ) = ( i . ( sup Y1 ) ) by A5,YELLOW_2:def 3
.= ( downarrow ( sup Y1 ) ) by YELLOW_2:def 4
.= y by WAYBEL14:5,WAYBEL_3:16;
end;
assume that
A6: x in ( dom i )
and
A7: y = ( i . x );
reconsider X = x as (Element of N) by A6;
A8: y = ( i . X ) by A7;
then reconsider Y = y as (Ideal of N) by YELLOW_2:41;
thus y in ( rng i ) by A1,A8;
thus ( s . y ) = ( sup Y ) by YELLOW_2:def 3
.= ( sup ( downarrow X ) ) by A7,YELLOW_2:def 4
.= x by WAYBEL_0:34;
end;
( dom s ) = (the carrier of I) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence s = ( i " ) by A1,A2,FUNCT_1:32;
thus thesis;
end;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:def 38;
