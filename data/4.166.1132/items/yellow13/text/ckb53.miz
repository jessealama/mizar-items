theorem
Th28: (for T being  topological_semilattice non  empty  TopSpace-like TopRelStr holds (for x being (Element of T) holds ( x "/\" ) is  continuous))
proof
let T being  topological_semilattice non  empty  TopSpace-like TopRelStr;
let x being (Element of T);
let p being (Point of T);
let G being (a_neighborhood of ( ( x "/\" ) . p ));
set TT = [: T,(T qua TopSpace) :];
A1: (the carrier of TT) = [: (the carrier of T),(the carrier of T) :] by BORSUK_1:def 2;
then reconsider xp = [ x,p ] as (Point of TT) by YELLOW_3:def 2;
(the carrier of [: T,T :]) = [: (the carrier of T),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then reconsider f = ( inf_op T ) as (Function of TT,T) by A1;
A2: ( f . xp ) = ( f . (x,p) )
.= ( x "/\" p ) by WAYBEL_2:def 4;
(G is (a_neighborhood of ( x "/\" p )) & f is  continuous) by CKB51:def 1,WAYBEL_1:def 18;
then consider H being (a_neighborhood of xp) such that A3: ( f .: H ) c= G by A2,BORSUK_1:def 1;
consider A being (Subset-Family of TT) such that A4: ( Int H ) = ( union A ) and A5: (for e being set holds (e in A implies (ex X1,Y1 being (Subset of T) st ((e = [: X1,Y1 :] & X1 is  open) & Y1 is  open)))) by BORSUK_1:5;
xp in ( Int H ) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
then consider Z being set such that A6: xp in Z and A7: Z in A by A4,TARSKI:def 4;
consider X1,Y1 being (Subset of T) such that A8: Z = [: X1,Y1 :] and X1 is  open and A9: Y1 is  open by A5,A7;
p in Y1 by A6,A8,ZFMISC_1:87;
then reconsider Y1 as (a_neighborhood of p) by A9,CONNSP_2:3;
take Y1;
let b being set;
assume b in ( ( x "/\" ) .: Y1 );
then consider a being set such that a in ( dom ( x "/\" ) ) and A10: a in Y1 and A11: b = ( ( x "/\" ) . a ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
reconsider a as (Element of T) by A10;
x in X1 by A6,A8,ZFMISC_1:87;
then [ x,a ] in Z by A8,A10,ZFMISC_1:87;
then A12: [ x,a ] in ( Int H ) by A4,A7,TARSKI:def 4;
[ x,a ] in [: (the carrier of T),(the carrier of T) :] by ZFMISC_1:87;
then A13: (( Int H ) c= H & [ x,a ] in ( dom f )) by A1,FUNCT_2:def 1,TOPS_1:16;
b = ( x "/\" a ) by A11,WAYBEL_1:def 18
.= ( f . (x,a) ) by WAYBEL_2:def 4;
then b in ( f .: H ) by A12,A13,FUNCT_1:def 6;
hence thesis by A3;
