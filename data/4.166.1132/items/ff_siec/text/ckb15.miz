theorem
Th14: (((((((( rng ( ( Flow M ) | (the carrier' of M) ) ) c= (the carrier of M) & ( rng ( ( ( Flow M ) ~ ) | (the carrier' of M) ) ) c= (the carrier of M)) & ( rng ( ( Flow M ) | (the carrier of M) ) ) c= (the carrier' of M)) & ( rng ( ( ( Flow M ) ~ ) | (the carrier of M) ) ) c= (the carrier' of M)) & ( rng ( id (the carrier' of M) ) ) c= (the carrier' of M)) & ( dom ( id (the carrier' of M) ) ) c= (the carrier' of M)) & ( rng ( id (the carrier of M) ) ) c= (the carrier of M)) & ( dom ( id (the carrier of M) ) ) c= (the carrier of M))
proof
A1: (for x holds (x in ( rng ( ( Flow M ) | (the carrier' of M) ) ) implies x in (the carrier of M)))
proof
let x;
assume x in ( rng ( ( Flow M ) | (the carrier' of M) ) );
then consider y such that A2: [ y,x ] in ( ( Flow M ) | (the carrier' of M) ) by RELAT_1:def 5;
A3: y in (the carrier' of M) by A2,RELAT_1:def 11;
[ y,x ] in ( Flow M ) by A2,RELAT_1:def 11;
hence thesis by A3,CKB13:1;
end;

proof

then consider y such that A5: [ y,x ] in ( ( ( Flow M ) ~ ) | (the carrier' of M) ) by RELAT_1:def 5;

A7: y in (the carrier' of M) by A5,RELAT_1:def 11;
[ x,y ] in ( Flow M ) by A6,RELAT_1:def 7;
