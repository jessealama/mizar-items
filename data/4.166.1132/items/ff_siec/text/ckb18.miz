proof
A1: ( rng ( ( Flow M ) | (the carrier' of M) ) ) misses ( dom ( ( Flow M ) | (the carrier' of M) ) ) by CKB17:1;
A2: ( rng ( ( ( Flow M ) ~ ) | (the carrier' of M) ) ) misses ( dom ( ( ( Flow M ) ~ ) | (the carrier' of M) ) ) by CKB17:1;
A3: ( rng ( ( Flow M ) | (the carrier' of M) ) ) misses ( dom ( ( ( Flow M ) ~ ) | (the carrier' of M) ) ) by CKB17:1;
A4: ( rng ( ( ( Flow M ) ~ ) | (the carrier' of M) ) ) misses ( dom ( ( Flow M ) | (the carrier' of M) ) ) by CKB17:1;
A5: ( rng ( ( Flow M ) | (the carrier of M) ) ) misses ( dom ( ( Flow M ) | (the carrier of M) ) ) by CKB17:1;
A6: ( rng ( ( ( Flow M ) ~ ) | (the carrier of M) ) ) misses ( dom ( ( ( Flow M ) ~ ) | (the carrier of M) ) ) by CKB17:1;
A7: ( rng ( ( Flow M ) | (the carrier of M) ) ) misses ( dom ( ( ( Flow M ) ~ ) | (the carrier of M) ) ) by CKB17:1;
( rng ( ( ( Flow M ) ~ ) | (the carrier of M) ) ) misses ( dom ( ( Flow M ) | (the carrier of M) ) ) by CKB17:1;
