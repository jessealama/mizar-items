proof
defpred X[ set ]
 means
(ex m st $1 = ( 2 * m ));
consider N being (Subset of ( NAT )) such that A1: (for n holds (n in N iff X[ n ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
defpred X[ set ]
 means
(ex m st $1 = ( ( 2 * m ) + 1 ));
consider M being (Subset of ( NAT )) such that A2: (for n holds (n in M iff X[ n ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
defpred X[ (Element of ( NAT )),set ]
 means
(($1 in N implies $2 = F(( $1 / 2 ))) & ($1 in M implies $2 = G(( ( $1 - 1 ) / 2 ))));
A3: (for n holds (ex r st X[ n,r ]))
proof
let n;
now
assume A4: n in N;
take r = F(( n / 2 ));
now
assume n in M;
then A5: (ex k st n = ( ( 2 * k ) + 1 )) by A2;
consider m such that A6: n = ( 2 * m ) by A1,A4;
n = ( ( 2 * m ) + ( 0 ) ) by A6;
hence contradiction by A5,NAT_1:18;

hence thesis;

hence thesis;

consider f being (Function of ( NAT ),( REAL )) such that A7: (for n holds X[ n,( f . n ) ]) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A3);
reconsider f as Real_Sequence;
take f;
let n;
( 2 * n ) in N by A1;
hence ( f . ( 2 * n ) ) = F(( ( 2 * n ) / 2 )) by A7
.= F(n);
( ( 2 * n ) + 1 ) in M by A2;
hence ( f . ( ( 2 * n ) + 1 ) ) = G(( ( ( ( 2 * n ) + 1 ) - 1 ) / 2 )) by A7
.= G(n);
