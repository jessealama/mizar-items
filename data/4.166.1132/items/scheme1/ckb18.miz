consider D being set such that A6: (for x holds (x in D iff (x in X() & X[ x ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
A7: (for x holds (x in D implies (ex y st X[ x,y ])))
proof
let x;
assume A8: x in D;
then A9: x in X() by A6;
now
per cases  by A6,A8;
suppose A10: P[ x ];

take y = F(x);
A11: (not S[ x ]) by A1,A9,A10;
((not Q[ x ]) & (not R[ x ])) by A1,A9,A10;
hence thesis by A11;
end;
suppose A12: Q[ x ];

take y = G(x);
A13: (not S[ x ]) by A1,A9,A12;
((not P[ x ]) & (not R[ x ])) by A1,A9,A12;
hence thesis by A13;
end;
suppose A14: R[ x ];

take y = H(x);
A15: (not S[ x ]) by A1,A9,A14;
((not P[ x ]) & (not Q[ x ])) by A1,A9,A14;
hence thesis by A15;
end;
suppose A16: S[ x ];

take y = I(x);
A17: (not R[ x ]) by A1,A9,A16;
((not P[ x ]) & (not Q[ x ])) by A1,A9,A16;
hence thesis by A17;

hence thesis;

consider f being Function such that A18: (( dom f ) = D & (for x holds (x in D implies X[ x,( f . x ) ]))) from CLASSES1:sch 1(A7);
A19: D c= X()
proof
let x;
assume x in D;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
( rng f ) c= Y()
proof
let x;
assume x in ( rng f );
then consider y such that A20: y in ( dom f ) and A21: x = ( f . y ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
now
per cases  by A6,A18,A20;
suppose A22: P[ y ];

then ( f . y ) = F(y) by A18,A20;
hence thesis by A2,A19,A18,A20,A21,A22;
end;
suppose A23: Q[ y ];

then ( f . y ) = G(y) by A18,A20;
hence thesis by A3,A19,A18,A20,A21,A23;
end;
suppose A24: R[ y ];

then ( f . y ) = H(y) by A18,A20;
hence thesis by A4,A19,A18,A20,A21,A24;
end;
suppose A25: S[ y ];

then ( f . y ) = I(y) by A18,A20;
hence thesis by A5,A19,A18,A20,A21,A25;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider f as (PartFunc of X(),Y()) by A19,A18,RELSET_1:4;
take f;
thus (for x holds (x in ( dom f ) iff (x in X() & (((P[ x ] or Q[ x ]) or R[ x ]) or S[ x ])))) by A6,A18;
let x;
assume x in ( dom f );
hence thesis by A18;
