theorem
Lm4: ( ( t => ( ( p => r ) => s ) ) => ( ( p => q ) => ( t => ( ( q => r ) => s ) ) ) ) in ( TAUT )
proof
(( ( p => q ) => ( ( ( p => r ) => s ) => ( ( q => r ) => s ) ) ) in ( TAUT ) & ( ( ( p => q ) => ( ( ( p => r ) => s ) => ( ( q => r ) => s ) ) ) => ( ( t => ( ( p => r ) => s ) ) => ( ( p => q ) => ( t => ( ( q => r ) => s ) ) ) ) ) in ( TAUT )) by CKB6:1,CKB7:1;
