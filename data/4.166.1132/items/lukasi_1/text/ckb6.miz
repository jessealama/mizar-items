theorem
Lm2: ( ( p => ( q => r ) ) => ( ( s => q ) => ( p => ( s => r ) ) ) ) in ( TAUT )
proof
(( ( ( ( ( q => r ) => ( s => r ) ) => ( p => ( s => r ) ) ) => ( ( s => q ) => ( p => ( s => r ) ) ) ) => ( ( p => ( q => r ) ) => ( ( s => q ) => ( p => ( s => r ) ) ) ) ) in ( TAUT ) & ( ( ( ( q => r ) => ( s => r ) ) => ( p => ( s => r ) ) ) => ( ( s => q ) => ( p => ( s => r ) ) ) ) in ( TAUT )) by CKB5:1;
