definition
let X;
func Cn X -> (Subset of ( CQC-WFF ))
means
:Def2: (t in it iff (for T holds ((T is  being_a_theory & X c= T) implies t in T)));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(for T holds ((T is  being_a_theory & X c= T) implies $1 in T));
consider Y being set such that A1: (for a holds (a in Y iff (a in ( CQC-WFF ) & P[ a ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
Y c= ( CQC-WFF )
proof
let a;
assume a in Y;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
then reconsider Z = Y as (Subset of ( CQC-WFF ));
take Z;
thus thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let Y being (Subset of ( CQC-WFF )),Z being (Subset of ( CQC-WFF ));
assume that
A2: (t in Y iff (for T holds ((T is  being_a_theory & X c= T) implies t in T)))
and
A3: (t in Z iff (for T holds ((T is  being_a_theory & X c= T) implies t in T)));
(a in Y iff a in Z)
proof
thus (a in Y implies a in Z)
proof
assume A4: a in Y;
then reconsider t = a as (Element of ( CQC-WFF ));
(for T holds ((T is  being_a_theory & X c= T) implies t in T)) by A2,A4;
hence thesis by A3;
end;

thus (a in Z implies a in Y)
proof
assume A5: a in Z;
then reconsider t = a as (Element of ( CQC-WFF ));
(for T holds ((T is  being_a_theory & X c= T) implies t in T)) by A3,A5;
hence thesis by A2;
end;

end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
