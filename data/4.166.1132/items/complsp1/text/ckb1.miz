begin
reserve n for (Element of ( NAT ));
definition
let n;
func the_Complex_Space n ->  strict TopSpace equals 
TopStruct (# ( COMPLEX n ),( ComplexOpenSets n ) #);
coherence
proof
set T = TopStruct (# ( COMPLEX n ),( ComplexOpenSets n ) #);
T is  TopSpace-like
proof
reconsider z = ( COMPLEX n ) as (Subset of ( COMPLEX n )) by ZFMISC_1:def 1;
z is  open by SEQ_4:107;
hence (the carrier of T) in (the topology of T);
thus (for A being (Subset-Family of T) holds (A c= (the topology of T) implies ( union A ) in (the topology of T)))
proof
let A being (Subset-Family of T);
assume A c= (the topology of T);
then A1: (for B being (Subset of ( COMPLEX n )) holds (B in A implies B is  open)) by SEQ_4:131;
reconsider z = ( union A ) as (Subset of ( COMPLEX n ));
z is  open by A1,SEQ_4:108;
hence thesis;

let A being (Subset of T);
let B being (Subset of T);
reconsider z1 = A,z2 = B as (Subset of ( COMPLEX n ));
reconsider z = ( A /\ B ) as (Subset of ( COMPLEX n ));
assume (A in (the topology of T) & B in (the topology of T));
then (z1 is  open & z2 is  open) by SEQ_4:131;
then z is  open by SEQ_4:109;
hence thesis;
