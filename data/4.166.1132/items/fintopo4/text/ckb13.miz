theorem
Th12: (for FT being  filled non  empty RelStr holds (for IT being (Subset of FT) holds (FT is  symmetric implies (IT is  connected iff (for A,B being (Subset of FT) holds ((IT = ( A \/ B ) & A,B are_separated ) implies (A = IT or B = IT)))))))
proof
let FT being  filled non  empty RelStr;
let IT being (Subset of FT);
assume A1: FT is  symmetric;
A2:now
assume A3: (for A,B being (Subset of FT) holds ((IT = ( A \/ B ) & A,B are_separated ) implies (A = IT or B = IT)));
(for A,B being (Subset of FT) holds ((((IT = ( A \/ B ) & A <> ( {} )) & B <> ( {} )) & A misses B) implies ( A ^b ) meets B))
proof
let A being (Subset of FT);
let B being (Subset of FT);
assume that
A4: IT = ( A \/ B )
and
A5: (A <> ( {} ) & B <> ( {} ))
and
A misses B;
now
assume A6: ( A ^b ) misses B;
now
assume A meets ( B ^b );
then consider x being set such that A7: x in A and A8: x in ( B ^b ) by XBOOLE_0:3;
consider x2 being (Element of FT) such that A9: x2 = x and A10: ( U_FT x2 ) meets B by A8;
set y = the (Element of ( ( U_FT x2 ) /\ B ));
A11: ( ( U_FT x2 ) /\ B ) <> ( {} ) by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A12: y in ( U_FT x2 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then reconsider y2 = y as (Element of FT);
x2 in ( U_FT y2 ) by A1,A12,FIN_TOPO:def 13;
then x2 in ( ( U_FT y2 ) /\ A ) by A7,A9,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then ( U_FT y2 ) meets A by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A13: y2 in ( A ^b );
y in B by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence contradiction by A6,A13,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
then A,B are_separated  by A6,CKB1:def 1;
then A14: (A = IT or B = IT) by A3,A4;
A15: A c= ( A ^b ) by FIN_TOPO:13;
( ( A ^b ) /\ B ) = ( {} ) by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then ( A /\ B ) = ( {} ) by A15,XBOOLE_1:3,XBOOLE_1:26;
hence contradiction by A4,A5,A14,XBOOLE_1:21;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
hence IT is  connected by FIN_TOPO:def 16;
end;
now
assume A16: IT is  connected;
thus (for A,B being (Subset of FT) holds ((IT = ( A \/ B ) & A,B are_separated ) implies (A = IT or B = IT)))
proof
let A being (Subset of FT);
let B being (Subset of FT);
assume that
A17: IT = ( A \/ B )
and
A18: A,B are_separated ;
A19: A misses B by A18,CKB7:1;
now
assume A20: A <> ( {} );
now
assume B <> ( {} );
then ( A ^b ) meets B by A16,A17,A19,A20,FIN_TOPO:def 16;
hence contradiction by A18,CKB1:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by A17;
end;
hence thesis by A17;
end;

end;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
