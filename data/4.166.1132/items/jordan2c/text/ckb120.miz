then ( P1 /\ B4 ) <> ( {} ( ( TOP-REAL n ) | ( A ` ) ) ) by A81,A83,A87,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A89: P1 meets B4 by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
B3 is  Bounded by A84,CKB14:def 1;

suppose n < 1;

then n < ( ( 0 ) + 1 );

(for q2 being (Point of ( TOP-REAL n )) holds |. q2 .| < 1)
proof
let q2 being (Point of ( TOP-REAL n ));
q2 = ( 0. ( TOP-REAL n ) ) by A91,CKB119:1;
hence thesis by TOPRNS_1:23;
end;
then (for q2 being (Point of ( TOP-REAL n )) holds (q2 in ( [#] ( TOP-REAL n ) ) implies |. q2 .| < 1));
then ( [#] ( TOP-REAL n ) ) is  Bounded by CKB45:1;
hence thesis by CKB13:1;
