proof
( dom (the Sorts of U0) ) = (the carrier of S) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
then ( (the Sorts of U0) . s ) in ( rng (the Sorts of U0) ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;

thus (x in X implies (ex B being (MSSubset of U0) st (B in ( SubSort A ) & x = ( B . s )))) by A1;
given B being (MSSubset of U0) such that

and
A5: x = ( B . s );

B c= (the Sorts of U0) by PBOOLE:def 18;
then ( B . s ) c= ( (the Sorts of U0) . s ) by PBOOLE:def 2;
