definition
let S being non void non empty ManySortedSign;
let U0 being MSAlgebra over S;
func Constants U0 -> (MSSubset of U0)
means
:Def5: (for s being (SortSymbol of S) holds ( it . s ) = ( Constants (U0,s) ));
existence
proof
deffunc G((SortSymbol of S)) = ( Constants (U0,$1) );
consider f being Function such that A1: (( dom f ) = (the carrier of S) & (for d being (SortSymbol of S) holds ( f . d ) = G(d))) from FUNCT_1:sch 4;
reconsider f as (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of S)) by A1,PARTFUN1:def 2,RELAT_1:def 18;
f c= (the Sorts of U0)
proof
let s being set;
assume s in (the carrier of S);
then reconsider s1 = s as (SortSymbol of S);
( f . s1 ) = ( Constants (U0,s1) ) by A1;
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider f as (MSSubset of U0) by PBOOLE:def 18;
take f;
thus thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let W1 being (MSSubset of U0),W2 being (MSSubset of U0);
assume that
A2: (for s being (SortSymbol of S) holds ( W1 . s ) = ( Constants (U0,s) ))
and
A3: (for s being (SortSymbol of S) holds ( W2 . s ) = ( Constants (U0,s) ));
(for s being set holds (s in (the carrier of S) implies ( W1 . s ) = ( W2 . s )))
proof
let s being set;
assume s in (the carrier of S);
then reconsider t = s as (SortSymbol of S);
( W1 . t ) = ( Constants (U0,t) ) by A2;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
hence thesis by PBOOLE:3;
end;
