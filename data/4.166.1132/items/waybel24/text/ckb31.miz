definition
let S being TopStruct;
let T being non  empty TopRelStr;
func ContMaps (S,T) ->  strict RelStr means 
:Def3: (it is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) )) & (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of it) iff (ex f being (Function of S,T) st (x = f & f is  continuous)))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex f being (Function of S,T) st ($1 = f & f is  continuous));
consider X being set such that A1: (for a being set holds (a in X iff (a in (the carrier of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) )) & P[ a ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
X c= (the carrier of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ))
proof
let a being set;
assume a in X;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
then reconsider X as (Subset of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ));
take SX = ( subrelstr X );
thus SX is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ));
let f being set;
hereby
assume f in (the carrier of SX);
then f in X by YELLOW_0:def 15;
then consider f9 being (Function of S,T) such that A2: (f9 = f & f9 is  continuous) by A1;
take f9;
thus (f9 = f & f9 is  continuous) by A2;
end;
given f9 being (Function of S,T) such that
A3: f = f9
and
A4: f9 is  continuous;

f in ( Funcs ((the carrier of S),(the carrier of T)) ) by A3,FUNCT_2:8;
then f in (the carrier of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) )) by YELLOW_1:28;
then f in X by A1,A3,A4;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:def 15;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let A1 being  strict RelStr;
let A2 being  strict RelStr;
assume that
A5: A1 is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ))
and
A6: (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of A1) iff (ex f being (Function of S,T) st (x = f & f is  continuous))))
and
A7: A2 is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ))
and
A8: (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of A2) iff (ex f being (Function of S,T) st (x = f & f is  continuous))));
(the carrier of A1) = (the carrier of A2)
proof
hereby
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of A1);
then (ex f being (Function of S,T) st (x = f & f is  continuous)) by A6;
hence x in (the carrier of A2) by A8;
end;
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of A2);
then (ex f being (Function of S,T) st (x = f & f is  continuous)) by A8;
hence thesis by A6;
