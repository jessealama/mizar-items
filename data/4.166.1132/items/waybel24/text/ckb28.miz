theorem
Th17: (for R,S,T being LATTICE holds (for f being  monotone (Function of [: R,S :],T) holds (for a being (Element of R) holds (for b being (Element of S) holds (for X being  directed (Subset of [: R,S :]) holds ((( ex_sup_of ( f .: X ),T & a in ( proj1 X )) & b in ( proj2 X )) implies ( f . [ a,b ] ) <= ( sup ( f .: X ) )))))))
proof
let R being LATTICE,S being LATTICE,T being LATTICE;
let f being  monotone (Function of [: R,S :],T);
let a being (Element of R);
let b being (Element of S);
let X being  directed (Subset of [: R,S :]);
assume that
A1:  ex_sup_of ( f .: X ),T
and
A2: a in ( proj1 X )
and
A3: b in ( proj2 X );
consider d being set such that A4: [ d,b ] in X by A3,RELAT_1:def 5;
d in ( proj1 X ) by A4,RELAT_1:def 4;
then reconsider d as (Element of R);
consider c being set such that A5: [ a,c ] in X by A2,RELAT_1:def 4;
c in ( proj2 X ) by A5,RELAT_1:def 5;
then reconsider c as (Element of S);
consider z being (Element of [: R,S :]) such that A6: z in X and A7: ([ a,c ] <= z & [ d,b ] <= z) by A5,A4,WAYBEL_0:def 1;
A8: ( f .: X ) is_<=_than ( sup ( f .: X ) ) by A1,YELLOW_0:30;
( [ a,c ] "\/" [ d,b ] ) <= ( z "\/" z ) by A7,YELLOW_3:3;
then ( [ a,c ] "\/" [ d,b ] ) <= z by YELLOW_5:1;
then [ ( a "\/" d ),( c "\/" b ) ] <= z by YELLOW10:16;
then A9: ( f . [ ( a "\/" d ),( c "\/" b ) ] ) <= ( f . z ) by WAYBEL_1:def 2;
( dom f ) = (the carrier of [: R,S :]) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( f . z ) in ( f .: X ) by A6,FUNCT_1:def 6;
then A10: ( f . z ) <= ( sup ( f .: X ) ) by A8,LATTICE3:def 9;
(a <= ( a "\/" d ) & b <= ( c "\/" b )) by YELLOW_0:22;
then [ a,b ] <= [ ( a "\/" d ),( c "\/" b ) ] by YELLOW_3:11;
then ( f . [ a,b ] ) <= ( f . [ ( a "\/" d ),( c "\/" b ) ] ) by WAYBEL_1:def 2;
then ( f . [ a,b ] ) <= ( f . z ) by A9,YELLOW_0:def 2;
hence thesis by A10,YELLOW_0:def 2;
