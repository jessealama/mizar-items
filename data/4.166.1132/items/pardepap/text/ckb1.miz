theorem
Th1: (SAS is  Pappian implies (for a1,a2,a3,b1,b2,b3 being (Element of SAS) holds ((((a1,a2 // a1,a3 & b1,b2 // b1,b3) & a1,b2 // a2,b1) & a2,b3 // a3,b2) implies a3,b1 // a1,b3)))
proof
assume A1: SAS is  Pappian;
let a1 being (Element of SAS),a2 being (Element of SAS),a3 being (Element of SAS),b1 being (Element of SAS),b2 being (Element of SAS),b3 being (Element of SAS);
