theorem
Th21: (((((X1 c= [: X1,X2,X3,X4,X5 :] or X1 c= [: X2,X3,X4,X5,X1 :]) or X1 c= [: X3,X4,X5,X1,X2 :]) or X1 c= [: X4,X5,X1,X2,X3 :]) or X1 c= [: X5,X1,X2,X3,X4 :]) implies X1 = ( {} ))
proof
assume that
A1: ((((X1 c= [: X1,X2,X3,X4,X5 :] or X1 c= [: X2,X3,X4,X5,X1 :]) or X1 c= [: X3,X4,X5,X1,X2 :]) or X1 c= [: X4,X5,X1,X2,X3 :]) or X1 c= [: X5,X1,X2,X3,X4 :])
and
A2: X1 <> ( {} );
A3: (((([: X1,X2,X3,X4,X5 :] <> ( {} ) or [: X2,X3,X4,X5,X1 :] <> ( {} )) or [: X3,X4,X5,X1,X2 :] <> ( {} )) or [: X4,X5,X1,X2,X3 :] <> ( {} )) or [: X5,X1,X2,X3,X4 :] <> ( {} )) by A1,A2,XBOOLE_1:3;
then A4: (X4 <> ( {} ) & X5 <> ( {} )) by CKB16:1;
A5: (X2 <> ( {} ) & X3 <> ( {} )) by A3,CKB16:1;
now
per cases  by A1;
suppose A6: X1 c= [: X1,X2,X3,X4,X5 :];

consider x such that A7: x in X1 and A8: (for x1 holds (for x2 holds (for x3 holds (for x4 holds (for x5 holds ((x1 in X1 or x2 in X1) implies x <> [ x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 ])))))) by A2,CKB11:1;
reconsider x as (Element of [: X1,X2,X3,X4,X5 :]) by A6,A7;
x = [ ( x `1 ),( x `2 ),( x `3 ),( x `4 ),( x `5 ) ] by A2,A5,A4,CKB27:1;
hence contradiction by A2,A8;
end;
suppose X1 c= [: X2,X3,X4,X5,X1 :];

then X1 c= [: [: X2,X3 :],X4,X5,X1 :] by CKB15:1;
hence thesis by A2,MCART_1:59;
end;
suppose X1 c= [: X3,X4,X5,X1,X2 :];

then X1 c= [: [: X3,X4 :],X5,X1,X2 :] by CKB15:1;
hence thesis by A2,MCART_1:59;
end;
suppose X1 c= [: X4,X5,X1,X2,X3 :];

then X1 c= [: [: X4,X5 :],X1,X2,X3 :] by CKB15:1;
hence thesis by A2,MCART_1:59;
end;
suppose A9: X1 c= [: X5,X1,X2,X3,X4 :];

consider x such that A10: x in X1 and A11: (for x1 holds (for x2 holds (for x3 holds (for x4 holds (for x5 holds ((x1 in X1 or x2 in X1) implies x <> [ x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 ])))))) by A2,CKB11:1;
reconsider x as (Element of [: X5,X1,X2,X3,X4 :]) by A9,A10;
x = [ ( x `1 ),( x `2 ),( x `3 ),( x `4 ),( x `5 ) ] by A2,A5,A4,CKB27:1;
hence thesis by A2,A11;
end;

hence contradiction;
