theorem
((for y holds (y in Z iff (ex x1 st (ex x2 st (ex x3 st (ex x4 st (ex x5 st (((((x1 in X1 & x2 in X2) & x3 in X3) & x4 in X4) & x5 in X5) & y = [ x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 ])))))))) implies Z = [: X1,X2,X3,X4,X5 :])
proof
assume A1: (for y holds (y in Z iff (ex x1 st (ex x2 st (ex x3 st (ex x4 st (ex x5 st (((((x1 in X1 & x2 in X2) & x3 in X3) & x4 in X4) & x5 in X5) & y = [ x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 ]))))))));
now
let y;
thus (y in Z implies y in [: [: X1,X2,X3,X4 :],X5 :])
proof
assume y in Z;
then consider x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 such that A2: (((x1 in X1 & x2 in X2) & x3 in X3) & x4 in X4) and A3: (x5 in X5 & y = [ x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 ]) by A1;
[ x1,x2,x3,x4 ] in [: X1,X2,X3,X4 :] by A2,MCART_1:80;
hence thesis by A3,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
end;

assume y in [: [: X1,X2,X3,X4 :],X5 :];
then consider x1234,x5 being set such that A4: x1234 in [: X1,X2,X3,X4 :] and A5: x5 in X5 and A6: y = [ x1234,x5 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
consider x1,x2,x3,x4 such that A7: (((x1 in X1 & x2 in X2) & x3 in X3) & x4 in X4) and A8: x1234 = [ x1,x2,x3,x4 ] by A4,MCART_1:79;
y = [ x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 ] by A6,A8;
hence y in Z by A1,A5,A7;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
