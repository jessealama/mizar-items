theorem
Lm3: ((((X1 <> ( {} ) & X2 <> ( {} )) & X3 <> ( {} )) & X4 <> ( {} )) implies (for x being (Element of [: X1,X2,X3,X4 :]) holds (ex xx1 st (ex xx2 st (ex xx3 st (ex xx4 st x = [ xx1,xx2,xx3,xx4 ]))))))
proof
assume that
A1: ((X1 <> ( {} ) & X2 <> ( {} )) & X3 <> ( {} ))
and
A2: X4 <> ( {} );
let x being (Element of [: X1,X2,X3,X4 :]);
reconsider x9 = x as (Element of [: [: X1,X2,X3 :],X4 :]) by ZFMISC_1:def 4;
[: X1,X2,X3 :] <> ( {} ) by A1,MCART_1:31;
then consider x123 being (Element of [: X1,X2,X3 :]),xx4 such that A3: x9 = [ x123,xx4 ] by A2,CKB1:1;
consider xx1,xx2,xx3 such that A4: x123 = [ xx1,xx2,xx3 ] by A1,CKB2:1;
take xx1;
take xx2;
take xx3;
take xx4;
thus thesis by A3,A4,MCART_1:def 4;
