theorem
Th17: (((((X1 <> ( {} ) & X2 <> ( {} )) & X3 <> ( {} )) & X4 <> ( {} )) & X5 <> ( {} )) implies (for x being (Element of [: X1,X2,X3,X4,X5 :]) holds (ex xx1 st (ex xx2 st (ex xx3 st (ex xx4 st (ex xx5 st x = [ xx1,xx2,xx3,xx4,xx5 ])))))))
proof
assume that
A1: (((X1 <> ( {} ) & X2 <> ( {} )) & X3 <> ( {} )) & X4 <> ( {} ))
and
A2: X5 <> ( {} );
let x being (Element of [: X1,X2,X3,X4,X5 :]);
reconsider x9 = x as (Element of [: [: X1,X2,X3,X4 :],X5 :]);
[: X1,X2,X3,X4 :] <> ( {} ) by A1,MCART_1:51;
then consider x1234 being (Element of [: X1,X2,X3,X4 :]),xx5 such that A3: x9 = [ x1234,xx5 ] by A2,CKB1:1;
consider xx1,xx2,xx3,xx4 such that A4: x1234 = [ xx1,xx2,xx3,xx4 ] by A1,CKB3:1;
take xx1;
take xx2;
take xx3;
take xx4;
take xx5;
thus thesis by A3,A4;
