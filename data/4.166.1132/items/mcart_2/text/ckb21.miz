definition
let X1;
let X2;
let X3;
let X4;
let X5;
let x being (Element of [: X1,X2,X3,X4,X5 :]);
assume A1: ((((X1 <> ( {} ) & X2 <> ( {} )) & X3 <> ( {} )) & X4 <> ( {} )) & X5 <> ( {} ));
func x `1 -> (Element of X1) means 
:Def3: (x = [ x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 ] implies it = x1);
existence
proof
consider xx1,xx2,xx3,xx4,xx5 such that A2: x = [ xx1,xx2,xx3,xx4,xx5 ] by A1,CKB20:1;
take xx1;
thus thesis by A2,CKB10:1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let y being (Element of X1);
let z being (Element of X1);
assume A3: (x = [ x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 ] implies y = x1);
assume A4: (x = [ x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 ] implies z = x1);
consider xx1,xx2,xx3,xx4,xx5 such that A5: x = [ xx1,xx2,xx3,xx4,xx5 ] by A1,CKB20:1;
y = xx1 by A5,A3;
hence thesis by A5,A4;
