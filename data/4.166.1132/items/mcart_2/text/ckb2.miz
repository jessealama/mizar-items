theorem
Lm2: (((X1 <> ( {} ) & X2 <> ( {} )) & X3 <> ( {} )) implies (for x being (Element of [: X1,X2,X3 :]) holds (ex xx1 st (ex xx2 st (ex xx3 st x = [ xx1,xx2,xx3 ])))))
proof
assume that
A1: (X1 <> ( {} ) & X2 <> ( {} ))
and
A2: X3 <> ( {} );
let x being (Element of [: X1,X2,X3 :]);
reconsider x9 = x as (Element of [: [: X1,X2 :],X3 :]) by ZFMISC_1:def 3;
[: X1,X2 :] <> ( {} ) by A1,ZFMISC_1:90;
then consider x12 being (Element of [: X1,X2 :]),xx3 such that A3: x9 = [ x12,xx3 ] by A2,CKB1:1;
consider xx1,xx2 such that A4: x12 = [ xx1,xx2 ] by A1,CKB1:1;
take xx1;
take xx2;
take xx3;
thus thesis by A3,A4,MCART_1:def 3;
