theorem
(for G,F being  associative  commutative  Group-like (multMagma-Family of ( Seg n )) holds ((for k being (Element of ( Seg n )) holds ( F . k ) = ( ProjGroup (G,k) )) implies (ex f being (Homomorphism of ( product F ),( product G )) st (f is  bijective & (for x being (Element of ( product F )) holds (ex s being (FinSequence of ( product G )) st (((( len s ) = n & (for k being (Element of ( Seg n )) holds ( s . k ) in ( F . k ))) & s = x) & ( f . x ) = ( Product s ))))))))
proof
let G being  associative  commutative  Group-like (multMagma-Family of ( Seg n ));
let F being  associative  commutative  Group-like (multMagma-Family of ( Seg n ));
assume A1: (for k being (Element of ( Seg n )) holds ( F . k ) = ( ProjGroup (G,k) ));
A2: (for i being (Element of ( Seg n )) holds ( F . i ) is (Subgroup of ( product G )))
proof
let i being (Element of ( Seg n ));
( F . i ) = ( ProjGroup (G,i) ) by A1;
hence thesis;

let x being (Element of ( product G ));
consider s being (FinSequence of ( product G )) such that A4: ((( len s ) = n & (for k being (Element of ( Seg n )) holds ( s . k ) in ( ProjGroup (G,k) ))) & x = ( Product s )) by CKB21:1;
take s;
(for k being (Element of ( Seg n )) holds ( s . k ) in ( F . k ))
proof
let k being (Element of ( Seg n ));
( s . k ) in ( ProjGroup (G,k) ) by A4;
hence thesis by A1;

(for s,t being (FinSequence of ( product G )) holds (((((( len s ) = n & (for k being (Element of ( Seg n )) holds ( s . k ) in ( F . k ))) & ( len t ) = n) & (for k being (Element of ( Seg n )) holds ( t . k ) in ( F . k ))) & ( Product s ) = ( Product t )) implies s = t))
proof
let s being (FinSequence of ( product G ));
let t being (FinSequence of ( product G ));
assume A5: ((((( len s ) = n & (for k being (Element of ( Seg n )) holds ( s . k ) in ( F . k ))) & ( len t ) = n) & (for k being (Element of ( Seg n )) holds ( t . k ) in ( F . k ))) & ( Product s ) = ( Product t ));
(for k being (Element of ( Seg n )) holds (( t . k ) in ( ProjGroup (G,k) ) & ( s . k ) in ( ProjGroup (G,k) )))
proof
let k being (Element of ( Seg n ));
(( s . k ) in ( F . k ) & ( t . k ) in ( F . k )) by A5;
hence thesis by A1;
