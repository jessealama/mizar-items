theorem
Lm1: (ex f being (Homomorphism of ( F . i ),( ProjGroup (F,i) )) st (f is  bijective & (for x being (Element of ( F . i )) holds ( f . x ) = ( ( 1_ ( product F ) ) +* (i,x) ))))
proof
A1: (the carrier of ( ProjGroup (F,i) )) = ( ProjSet (F,i) ) by CKB12:def 1;
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
$2 = ( ( 1_ ( product F ) ) +* (i,$1) );
A2: (for x being (Element of ( F . i )) holds (ex y being (Element of ( ProjGroup (F,i) )) st P[ x,y ]))
proof
let x being (Element of ( F . i ));
( ( 1_ ( product F ) ) +* (i,x) ) in ( ProjSet (F,i) ) by CKB5:def 1;
hence thesis by A1;

consider f being (Function of ( F . i ),(the carrier of ( ProjGroup (F,i) ))) such that A3: (for x being (Element of (the carrier of ( F . i ))) holds P[ x,( f . x ) ]) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A2);
(for a,b being (Element of ( F . i )) holds ( f . ( a * b ) ) = ( ( f . a ) * ( f . b ) ))
proof
let a being (Element of ( F . i ));
let b being (Element of ( F . i ));
A4: ( f . a ) = ( ( 1_ ( product F ) ) +* (i,a) ) by A3;
A5: ( f . b ) = ( ( 1_ ( product F ) ) +* (i,b) ) by A3;
A6: ( f . ( a * b ) ) = ( ( 1_ ( product F ) ) +* (i,( a * b )) ) by A3;
(the carrier of ( ProjGroup (F,i) )) = ( ProjSet (F,i) ) by CKB12:def 1;
then reconsider ffa = ( f . a ),ffb = ( f . b ) as (Element of ( product F )) by TARSKI:def 3;
thus ( ( f . a ) * ( f . b ) ) = ( ffa * ffb ) by GROUP_2:43
.= ( f . ( a * b ) ) by A6,A4,A5,CKB8:1;
end;
then reconsider f as (Homomorphism of ( F . i ),( ProjGroup (F,i) )) by GROUP_6:def 6;
take f;
now
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of ( ProjGroup (F,i) ));
then consider g being (Element of ( F . i )) such that A7: x = ( ( 1_ ( product F ) ) +* (i,g) ) by CKB5:def 1,A1;
x = ( f . g ) by A7,A3;
hence x in ( rng f ) by FUNCT_2:4;
end;
then A8: (the carrier of ( ProjGroup (F,i) )) c= ( rng f ) by TARSKI:def 3;
( rng f ) = (the carrier of ( ProjGroup (F,i) )) by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then A9: f is  onto by FUNCT_2:def 3;
(for x1,x2 being set holds (((x1 in (the carrier of ( F . i )) & x2 in (the carrier of ( F . i ))) & ( f . x1 ) = ( f . x2 )) implies x1 = x2))
proof
let x1 being set;
let x2 being set;
assume A10: ((x1 in (the carrier of ( F . i )) & x2 in (the carrier of ( F . i ))) & ( f . x1 ) = ( f . x2 ));
then reconsider xx1 = x1,xx2 = x2 as (Element of (the carrier of ( F . i )));
A11: ( f . xx1 ) = ( ( 1_ ( product F ) ) +* (i,xx1) ) by A3;
A12: ( ( 1_ ( product F ) ) +* (i,xx1) ) = ( ( 1_ ( product F ) ) +* (i,xx2) ) by A10,A11,A3;
(the carrier of ( product F )) = ( product ( Carrier F ) ) by GROUP_7:def 2;
then A13: ( dom ( 1_ ( product F ) ) ) = I by PARTFUN1:def 2;
thus x1 = ( ( ( 1_ ( product F ) ) +* ( i .--> xx1 ) ) . i ) by FUNCT_7:94
.= ( ( ( 1_ ( product F ) ) +* (i,xx1) ) . i ) by A13,FUNCT_7:def 3
.= ( ( ( 1_ ( product F ) ) +* ( i .--> xx2 ) ) . i ) by A13,A12,FUNCT_7:def 3
.= x2 by FUNCT_7:94;
end;
then f is  one-to-one by FUNCT_2:19;
hence f is  bijective by A9;
thus thesis by A3;
