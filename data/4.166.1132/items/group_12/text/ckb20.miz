Th10: (for F being  associative  Group-like (multMagma-Family of ( Seg n )) holds (for x being (Element of ( product F )) holds (for s,t being (FinSequence of ( product F )) holds ((((((( len s ) = n & (for k being (Element of ( Seg n )) holds ( s . k ) in ( ProjGroup (F,k) ))) & x = ( Product s )) & ( len t ) = n) & (for k being (Element of ( Seg n )) holds ( t . k ) in ( ProjGroup (F,k) ))) & x = ( Product t )) implies s = t))))
proof
let F being  associative  Group-like (multMagma-Family of ( Seg n ));
let x being (Element of ( product F ));
let s being (FinSequence of ( product F )),t being (FinSequence of ( product F ));
set I = ( Seg n );
assume that
A1: ( len s ) = n
and
A2: (for k being (Element of I) holds ( s . k ) in ( ProjGroup (F,k) ))
and
A3: x = ( Product s )
and
A4: ( len t ) = n
and
A5: (for k being (Element of I) holds ( t . k ) in ( ProjGroup (F,k) ))
and
A6: x = ( Product t );
now
let i being Nat;
assume A7: (1 <= i & i <= n);
then reconsider i0 = i as (Element of I) by FINSEQ_1:1;
consider si being (Element of ( product F )) such that A8: (si = ( s . i ) & ( x . i ) = ( si . i )) by A1,A2,A3,A7,CKB19:1;
consider ti being (Element of ( product F )) such that A9: (ti = ( t . i ) & ( x . i ) = ( ti . i )) by A4,A5,A6,A7,CKB19:1;
( s . i0 ) in ( ProjGroup (F,i0) ) by A2;
then ( s . i0 ) in (the carrier of ( ProjGroup (F,i0) )) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
then A10: ( s . i0 ) in ( ProjSet (F,i0) ) by CKB12:def 1;
consider sn being Function,gn being (Element of ( F . i0 )) such that A11: (((sn = si & ( dom sn ) = I) & ( sn . i0 ) = gn) & (for k being (Element of I) holds (k <> i0 implies ( sn . k ) = ( 1_ ( F . k ) )))) by A8,A10,CKB7:1;
( t . i0 ) in ( ProjGroup (F,i0) ) by A5;
then ( t . i0 ) in (the carrier of ( ProjGroup (F,i0) )) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
then A12: ( t . i0 ) in ( ProjSet (F,i0) ) by CKB12:def 1;
consider tn being Function,fn being (Element of ( F . i0 )) such that A13: (((tn = ti & ( dom tn ) = I) & ( tn . i0 ) = fn) & (for k being (Element of I) holds (k <> i0 implies ( tn . k ) = ( 1_ ( F . k ) )))) by A9,A12,CKB7:1;
now
let x being set;
assume x in ( dom sn );
then reconsider j = x as (Element of I) by A11;
per cases ;
suppose j = i;

hence ( sn . x ) = ( tn . x ) by A8,A9,A11,A13;
end;
suppose A14: j <> i;

then ( sn . j ) = ( 1_ ( F . j ) ) by A11;
hence ( sn . x ) = ( tn . x ) by A14,A13;
end;
end;
hence ( s . i ) = ( t . i ) by A8,A9,A11,A13,FUNCT_1:2;
end;
hence thesis by A1,A4,FINSEQ_1:14;
