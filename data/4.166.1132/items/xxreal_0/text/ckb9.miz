x in ( ExtREAL ) by CKB1:def 1;
then A2: (x in ( ( ( REAL+ ) \/ [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] ) \ { [ ( 0 ),( 0 ) ] } ) or x in { ( +infty ),( -infty ) }) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
per cases  by A1;
suppose that A3: x in ( REAL+ )

reconsider x9 = x as (Element of ( REAL+ )) by A3;
(not x9 <=' x9) by A4;
hence thesis;

suppose that A5: x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]
and
A6: (not (ex x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = [ ( 0 ),x9 ] & x = [ ( 0 ),y9 ]) & y9 <=' x9)));
consider z being set,x9 being set such that A7: z in { ( 0 ) } and A8: x9 in ( REAL+ ) and A9: x = [ z,x9 ] by A5,ZFMISC_1:84;
reconsider x9 as (Element of ( REAL+ )) by A8;
x = [ ( 0 ),x9 ] by A7,A9,TARSKI:def 1;
then (not x9 <=' x9) by A6;

x in ( ExtREAL ) by CKB1:def 1;
then A11: (x in ( ( ( REAL+ ) \/ [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] ) \ { [ ( 0 ),( 0 ) ] } ) or x in { ( +infty ),( -infty ) }) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;

A14: (not (ex x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = x9 & y = y9) & x9 <=' y9)));
hereby
assume (y in ( REAL+ ) & x in ( REAL+ ));
then reconsider x9 = x,y9 = y as (Element of ( REAL+ ));
take y9;
take x9;
thus (y = y9 & x = x9);
thus y9 <=' x9 by A14;

thus thesis by A13,ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;

now

then consider z being set,y9 being set such that A17: z in { ( 0 ) } and A18: y9 in ( REAL+ ) and A19: y = [ z,y9 ] by ZFMISC_1:84;
A20: z = ( 0 ) by A17,TARSKI:def 1;
assume x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :];
then consider z being set,x9 being set such that A21: z in { ( 0 ) } and A22: x9 in ( REAL+ ) and A23: x = [ z,x9 ] by ZFMISC_1:84;
reconsider x9,y9 as (Element of ( REAL+ )) by A18,A22;
take y9;
take x9;
thus (y = [ ( 0 ),y9 ] & x = [ ( 0 ),x9 ]) by A17,A19,A21,A23,TARSKI:def 1;
z = ( 0 ) by A21,TARSKI:def 1;
hence x9 <=' y9 by A16,A19,A20,A23;
end;
hence thesis by A15,ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;
