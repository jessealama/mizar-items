theorem
Th2: ((a <= b & b <= c) implies a <= c)
proof
assume that
A1: a <= b
and
A2: b <= c;
per cases ;
suppose that A3: a in ( REAL+ )
and
A4: b in ( REAL+ )
and
A5: c in ( REAL+ );
consider b99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )),c9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A6: b = b99 and A7: c = c9 and A8: b99 <=' c9 by A2,A4,A5,CKB9:def 1;
consider a9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )),b9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A9: a = a9 and A10: (b = b9 & a9 <=' b9) by A1,A3,A4,CKB9:def 1;
a9 <=' c9 by A10,A6,A8,ARYTM_1:3;
hence thesis by A5,A9,A7,CKB9:def 1;
end;
suppose A11: (a in ( REAL+ ) & b in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]);

then ((not (a in ( REAL+ ) & b in ( REAL+ ))) & (not (a in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & b in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))) by ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A1,A11,CKB9:def 1,CKB15:1,CKB16:1;
end;
suppose A12: (b in ( REAL+ ) & c in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]);

then ((not (c in ( REAL+ ) & b in ( REAL+ ))) & (not (c in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & b in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))) by ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A2,A12,CKB9:def 1,CKB15:1,CKB16:1;
end;
suppose that A13: (a in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & c in ( REAL+ ));
((not (a in ( REAL+ ) & c in ( REAL+ ))) & (not (a in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & c in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))) by A13,ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A13,CKB9:def 1;
end;
suppose that A14: a in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]
and
A15: b in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]
and
A16: c in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :];
consider b99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )),c9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A17: b = [ ( 0 ),b99 ] and A18: c = [ ( 0 ),c9 ] and A19: c9 <=' b99 by A2,A15,A16,CKB9:def 1;
consider a9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )),b9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A20: a = [ ( 0 ),a9 ] and A21: b = [ ( 0 ),b9 ] and A22: b9 <=' a9 by A1,A14,A15,CKB9:def 1;
b9 = b99 by A21,A17,ZFMISC_1:27;
then c9 <=' a9 by A22,A19,ARYTM_1:3;
hence thesis by A14,A16,A20,A18,CKB9:def 1;
end;
suppose that A23: (not ((a in ( REAL+ ) & b in ( REAL+ )) & c in ( REAL+ )))
and
A24: (not (a in ( REAL+ ) & b in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))
and
A25: (not (b in ( REAL+ ) & c in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))
and
A26: (not (a in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & c in ( REAL+ )))
and
A27: (not ((a in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & b in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]) & c in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]));
A28: (b = ( +infty ) implies c = ( +infty )) by A2,CKB21:1;
A29: (b = ( -infty ) implies a = ( -infty )) by A1,CKB20:1;
(((a = ( -infty ) or b = ( +infty )) or b = ( -infty )) or c = ( +infty )) by A1,A2,A23,A25,A26,A27,CKB9:def 1;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A23,A24,A25,A27,A28,A29,CKB9:def 1;
