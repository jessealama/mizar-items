theorem
Th1: ((a <= b & b <= a) implies a = b)
proof
assume that
A1: a <= b
and
A2: b <= a;
per cases ;
suppose (a in ( REAL+ ) & b in ( REAL+ ));

then ((ex a9,b9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((a = a9 & b = b9) & a9 <=' b9)) & (ex b99,a99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((b = b99 & a = a99) & b99 <=' a99))) by A1,A2,CKB9:def 1;
hence thesis by ARYTM_1:4;
end;
suppose A3: (a in ( REAL+ ) & b in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]);

then ((not b in ( REAL+ )) & (not a in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :])) by ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A1,A3,CKB9:def 1,CKB15:1,CKB16:1;
end;
suppose A4: (b in ( REAL+ ) & a in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]);

then ((not a in ( REAL+ )) & (not b in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :])) by ARYTM_0:5,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A2,A4,CKB9:def 1,CKB15:1,CKB16:1;
end;
suppose that A5: (a in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & b in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]);
consider a9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )),b9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A6: (a = [ ( 0 ),a9 ] & b = [ ( 0 ),b9 ]) and A7: b9 <=' a9 by A1,A5,CKB9:def 1;
consider b99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )),a99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A8: (b = [ ( 0 ),b99 ] & a = [ ( 0 ),a99 ]) and A9: a99 <=' b99 by A2,A5,CKB9:def 1;
(a9 = a99 & b9 = b99) by A6,A8,ZFMISC_1:27;
hence thesis by A7,A8,A9,ARYTM_1:4;
end;
suppose ((a = ( -infty ) or a = ( +infty )) & (b = ( -infty ) or b = ( +infty )));

hence thesis by A1,A2,CKB18:1;
end;
suppose that A10: ((not (a in ( REAL+ ) & b in ( REAL+ ))) & (not (a in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] & b in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :])))
and
A11: (not (b in ( REAL+ ) & a in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]))
and
A12: (not (a in ( REAL+ ) & b in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :]));
(a = ( -infty ) or b = ( +infty )) by A1,A10,A11,CKB9:def 1;
hence thesis by A2,A10,A12,CKB9:def 1,CKB18:1;
