Th15: (for IIG holds (for A being  finite-yielding  non-empty MSAlgebra over IIG holds (for v,w being (Element of IIG) holds ((v in ( InnerVertices IIG ) & w in ( rng ( the_arity_of ( action_at v ) ) )) implies ( size (w,A) ) < ( size (v,A) )))))

now
assume v in ( SortsWithConstants IIG );
then v in { v9 where v9 is (SortSymbol of IIG): v9 is  with_const_op } by MSAFREE2:def 1;
