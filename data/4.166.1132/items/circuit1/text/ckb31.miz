theorem
Th19: (for IIG holds (for A being  non-empty (Circuit of IIG) holds (for v being (Vertex of IIG) holds (( depth (v,A) ) = ( 0 ) iff (v in ( InputVertices IIG ) or v in ( SortsWithConstants IIG ))))))
proof
let IIG;
let A being  non-empty (Circuit of IIG);
let v being (Vertex of IIG);
consider s being  finite non  empty (Subset of ( NAT )) such that A1: s = { ( depth t ) where t is (Element of ( (the Sorts of ( FreeEnv A )) . v )): (not contradiction) } and A2: ( depth (v,A) ) = ( max s ) by CKB28:def 1;
reconsider Y = s as  finite non  empty  real-membered set;
A3: ( max Y ) in { ( depth t ) where t is (Element of ( (the Sorts of ( FreeEnv A )) . v )): (not contradiction) } by A1,XXREAL_2:def 8;
consider ss being  finite non  empty (Subset of ( NAT )) such that A4: ss = { ( card tt ) where tt is (Element of ( (the Sorts of ( FreeEnv A )) . v )): (not contradiction) } and A5: ( size (v,A) ) = ( max ss ) by CKB19:def 1;
reconsider YY = ss as  finite non  empty  real-membered set;
consider t being (Element of ( (the Sorts of ( FreeEnv A )) . v )) such that A6: ( depth t ) = ( max Y ) by A3;
reconsider t99 = t as Function;
consider t2 being (Element of ( (the Sorts of ( FreeMSA (the Sorts of A) )) . v )) such that A7: t = t2 and A8: ( depth t ) = ( depth t2 ) by CKB24:def 1;
consider dt being  finite DecoratedTree,t9 being  finite Tree such that A9: (dt = t2 & t9 = ( dom dt )) and A10: ( depth t2 ) = ( height t9 ) by MSAFREE2:def 14;
consider p being (FinSequence of ( NAT )) such that A11: p in t9 and A12: ( len p ) = ( height t9 ) by TREES_1:def 12;
consider y99 being set such that A13: [ p,y99 ] in t99 by A7,A9,A11,RELAT_1:def 4;
thus (( depth (v,A) ) = ( 0 ) implies (v in ( InputVertices IIG ) or v in ( SortsWithConstants IIG )))
proof
assume A14: ( depth (v,A) ) = ( 0 );
A15: (for kk being  ext-real number holds (kk in YY implies kk <= 1))
proof
let kk being  ext-real number;

then ( rng tt ) = { ( tt . ( {} ) ) } by A18,A17,FUNCT_1:4,TREES_1:29,TREES_1:43;
then tt = { [ ( {} ),( tt . ( {} ) ) ] } by A18,A17,A19,PRE_CIRC:1,TREES_1:29,TREES_1:43;
hence thesis by A16,CARD_1:30;

then ( card t ) = 1 by CARD_1:30;
then 1 in YY by A4;
then ( size (v,A) ) = 1 by A5,A15,XXREAL_2:def 8;
then v in ( ( InputVertices IIG ) \/ ( SortsWithConstants IIG ) ) by CKB20:1;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
