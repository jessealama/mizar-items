theorem
Th31: (for F being non empty  finite set holds (for A being non empty (FinSequence of ( bool F )) holds (A is  Hall implies (ex G being (Singlification of A) st G is  Hall))))
proof
let F being non empty  finite set;
let A being non empty (FinSequence of ( bool F ));
defpred P[ (Element of ( NAT )) ]
 means
($1 in ( dom A ) implies (ex g being (Singlification of A,$1) st (g is  Hall & (for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ((1 <= k & k <= $1) implies g is (Singlification of A,k))))));
assume A1: A is  Hall;
then A2: A is  non-empty;
A3: (for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (P[ k ] implies P[ ( k + 1 ) ]))
proof
let k being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume A4: P[ k ];
(( k + 1 ) in ( dom A ) implies (ex g being (Singlification of A,( k + 1 )) st (g is  Hall & (for l being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ((1 <= l & l <= ( k + 1 )) implies g is (Singlification of A,l))))))
proof
assume A5: ( k + 1 ) in ( dom A );
per cases  by A5,TAXONOM1:1;
suppose A6: k = ( 0 );

consider g being (Singlification of A,( k + 1 )) such that A7: g is  Hall by A1,A5,CKB48:1;
(for l being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ((1 <= l & l <= ( k + 1 )) implies g is (Singlification of A,l))) by A6,XXREAL_0:1;
hence thesis by A7;
end;
suppose A8: k in ( dom A );

then consider g being (Singlification of A,k) such that A9: g is  Hall and A10: (for l being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ((1 <= l & l <= k) implies g is (Singlification of A,l))) by A4;
( k + 1 ) in ( dom g ) by A5,CKB32:def 1;
then consider G being (Singlification of g,( k + 1 )) such that A11: G is  Hall by A9,CKB48:1;
A12: ( dom g ) = ( dom A ) by CKB32:def 1;
then A13: ( dom G ) = ( dom A ) by CKB32:def 1;
then A14: ( G . k ) <> ( {} ) by A8,A11;
A15: ( g . ( k + 1 ) ) <> ( {} ) by A9,A5,A12;
then reconsider G as (Singlification of A,( k + 1 )) by A2,A5,A8,A14,CKB39:1;
(for l being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ((1 <= l & l <= ( k + 1 )) implies G is (Singlification of A,l)))
proof
let l being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume that
A16: 1 <= l
and
A17: l <= ( k + 1 );
( k + 1 ) <= ( len A ) by A5,FINSEQ_3:25;
then l <= ( len A ) by A17,XXREAL_0:2;
then A18: l in ( dom A ) by A16,FINSEQ_3:25;
then A19: ( G . l ) <> ( {} ) by A13,A11;
per cases  by A17,NAT_1:8;
suppose l <= k;

then g is (Singlification of A,l) by A10,A16;
hence thesis by A2,A5,A15,A18,A19,CKB39:1;
end;
suppose l = ( k + 1 );

hence thesis;
end;
end;
hence thesis by A11;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
A20: P[ ( 0 ) ]
proof
assume ( 0 ) in ( dom A );
then consider G being (Singlification of A,( 0 )) such that A21: G is  Hall by A1,CKB48:1;
(for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ((1 <= k & k <= ( 0 )) implies G is (Singlification of A,k)));
hence thesis by A21;
end;
(for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ n ]) from NAT_1:sch 1(A20,A3);
then (( len A ) in ( dom A ) implies (ex g being (Singlification of A,( len A )) st (g is  Hall & (for l being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ((1 <= l & l <= ( len A )) implies g is (Singlification of A,l))))));
then consider G being (Singlification of A,( len A )) such that A22: G is  Hall and A23: (for l being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ((1 <= l & l <= ( len A )) implies G is (Singlification of A,l))) by FINSEQ_5:6;
A24: (for i being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (i in ( dom A ) implies G is (Singlification of A,i)))
proof
let i being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume i in ( dom A );
then (1 <= i & i <= ( len A )) by FINSEQ_3:25;
hence thesis by A23;
end;
( dom G ) = ( dom A ) by CKB32:def 1;
then G is (Singlification of A) by A2,A24,CKB43:1;
hence thesis by A22;
