func union (A,J) -> set

existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex j being set st ((j in J & j in ( dom A )) & $1 in ( A . j )));
consider X being set such that A1: (for x being set holds (x in X iff (x in F & P[ x ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
take X;
let x being set;
thus (x in X implies (ex j being set st ((j in J & j in ( dom A )) & x in ( A . j )))) by A1;
given j being set such that
A2: j in J
and
A3: j in ( dom A )
and
A4: x in ( A . j );

(( rng A ) c= ( bool F ) & ( A . j ) in ( rng A )) by A3,FINSEQ_1:def 4,FUNCT_1:3;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A3,A4;

proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex j being set st ((j in J & j in ( dom A )) & $1 in ( A . j )));
let A1 being set,A2 being set;
assume that
A5: (for x being set holds (x in A1 iff (ex j being set st ((j in J & j in ( dom A )) & x in ( A . j )))))
and
A6: (for x being set holds (x in A2 iff (ex j being set st ((j in J & j in ( dom A )) & x in ( A . j )))));
A7: (for x being set holds (x in A2 iff P[ x ])) by A6;

A1 = A2 from XBOOLE_0:sch 2(A8,A7);
hence thesis;
