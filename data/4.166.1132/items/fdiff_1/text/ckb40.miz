proof
A1: ( {} ( REAL ) ) is  closed
proof
let a being Real_Sequence;

proof
let x;

consider p such that A15: (for r holds ( L . r ) = ( p * r )) by CKB7:def 1;
( ( f . x0 ) - ( f . x0 ) ) = ( ( L . ( x0 - x0 ) ) + ( R . ( x0 - x0 ) ) ) by A14,RCOMP_1:16;

end;
( lim h ) = ( 0 ) by CKB2:def 1;

now
let s1;
assume that
( rng s1 ) c= ( dom R )
and
A29: (s1 is  convergent & ( lim s1 ) = ( 0 ))
and
A30: (for n holds ( s1 . n ) <> ( 0 ));
s1 is  non-zero by A30,SEQ_1:5;
then s1 is  convergent_to_0  convergent_to_0 Real_Sequence by A29,CKB2:def 1;
