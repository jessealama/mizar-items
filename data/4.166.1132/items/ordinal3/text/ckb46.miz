theorem
Th47: (((( {} ) <> ( dom fi ) & ( dom fi ) = ( dom psi )) & (for A holds (for B holds ((A in ( dom fi ) & B = ( fi . A )) implies ( psi . A ) = ( C +^ B ))))) implies ( sup psi ) = ( C +^ ( sup fi ) ))
proof
assume that
A1: ( {} ) <> ( dom fi )
and
A2: ( dom fi ) = ( dom psi )
and
A3: (for A holds (for B holds ((A in ( dom fi ) & B = ( fi . A )) implies ( psi . A ) = ( C +^ B ))));
set z = the (Element of ( dom fi ));
reconsider z9 = ( fi . z ) as Ordinal;
A4: ( C +^ ( sup ( rng fi ) ) ) c= ( sup ( rng psi ) )
proof
let x;
assume A5: x in ( C +^ ( sup ( rng fi ) ) );
then reconsider A = x as Ordinal;
A6:now
given B such that
A7: B in ( sup ( rng fi ) )
and
A8: A = ( C +^ B );

consider D such that A9: D in ( rng fi ) and A10: B c= D by A7,ORDINAL2:21;
consider x such that A11: x in ( dom fi ) and A12: D = ( fi . x ) by A9,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider x as Ordinal by A11;
( psi . x ) = ( C +^ D ) by A3,A11,A12;
then ( C +^ D ) in ( rng psi ) by A2,A11,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then ( C +^ D ) in ( sup ( rng psi ) ) by ORDINAL2:19;
hence A in ( sup ( rng psi ) ) by A8,A10,ORDINAL1:12,ORDINAL2:33;
end;
now
( C +^ z9 ) = ( psi . z ) by A1,A3;
then ( C +^ z9 ) in ( rng psi ) by A1,A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then A13: ( C +^ z9 ) in ( sup ( rng psi ) ) by ORDINAL2:19;
assume A14: A in C;
C c= ( C +^ z9 ) by CKB27:1;
then A c= ( C +^ z9 ) by A14,ORDINAL1:def 2;
hence A in ( sup ( rng psi ) ) by A13,ORDINAL1:12;
end;
hence thesis by A5,A6,CKB41:1;
end;
( sup ( rng psi ) ) c= ( C +^ ( sup ( rng fi ) ) )
proof

assume A15: x in ( sup ( rng psi ) );
then reconsider A = x as Ordinal;

y9 in ( rng fi ) by A2,A18,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then A20: y9 in ( sup ( rng fi ) ) by ORDINAL2:19;
B = ( C +^ y9 ) by A2,A3,A18,A19;
then B in ( C +^ ( sup ( rng fi ) ) ) by A20,ORDINAL2:32;
hence thesis by A17,ORDINAL1:12;
end;
hence thesis by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
