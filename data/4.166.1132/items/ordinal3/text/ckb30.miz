theorem
Th30: (A c= B implies (ex C st B = ( A +^ C )))
proof
defpred P[ Ordinal ]
 means
(A c= $1 implies (ex C st $1 = ( A +^ C )));
A1: (for B holds (P[ B ] implies P[ ( succ B ) ]))
proof
let B;
assume that
A2: (A c= B implies (ex C st B = ( A +^ C )))
and
A3: A c= ( succ B );
A4:now
assume A <> ( succ B );
then A c< ( succ B ) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 8;
then A in ( succ B ) by ORDINAL1:11;
then consider C such that A5: B = ( A +^ C ) by A2,ORDINAL1:22;
( succ B ) = ( A +^ ( succ C ) ) by A5,ORDINAL2:28;
hence thesis;
end;
(A = ( succ B ) implies ( succ B ) = ( A +^ ( {} ) )) by ORDINAL2:27;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
A6: (for B holds (((B <> ( {} ) & B is  limit_ordinal) & (for C holds (C in B implies P[ C ]))) implies P[ B ]))
proof
deffunc F(Ordinal) = ( A +^ $1 );
let B;
assume that
B <> ( {} )
and
A7: B is  limit_ordinal
and
(for C holds (C in B implies (A c= C implies (ex D st C = ( A +^ D )))))
and
A8: A c= B;
defpred P[ Ordinal ]
 means
B c= ( A +^ $1 );
A9: B = ( ( {} ) +^ B ) by ORDINAL2:30;
( ( {} ) +^ B ) c= ( A +^ B ) by ORDINAL2:34,XBOOLE_1:2;
then A10: (ex C st P[ C ]) by A9;
consider C such that A11: (P[ C ] & (for D holds (P[ D ] implies C c= D))) from ORDINAL1:sch 1(A10);
consider L being Ordinal-Sequence such that A12: (( dom L ) = C & (for D holds (D in C implies ( L . D ) = F(D)))) from ORDINAL2:sch 3;
A13:now
(for D holds (D in ( rng L ) implies D in B))
proof
let D;
assume D in ( rng L );
then consider y such that A14: y in ( dom L ) and A15: D = ( L . y ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider y as Ordinal by A14;
A16: (not C c= y) by A12,A14,ORDINAL1:5;
( L . y ) = ( A +^ y ) by A12,A14;
hence thesis by A11,A15,A16,ORDINAL1:16;
end;
then A17: ( sup ( rng L ) ) c= B by ORDINAL2:20;
A18: C is  limit_ordinal
proof
assume (not thesis);
then consider D such that A19: C = ( succ D ) by ORDINAL1:29;
(not C c= D) by A19,ORDINAL1:5,ORDINAL1:6;
then ( A +^ D ) in B by A11,ORDINAL1:16;
then A20: ( succ ( A +^ D ) ) c= B by ORDINAL1:21;
( succ ( A +^ D ) ) = ( A +^ ( succ D ) ) by ORDINAL2:28;
then B = ( succ ( A +^ D ) ) by A11,A19,A20,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence contradiction by A7,ORDINAL1:29;
end;
assume C <> ( {} );
then ( A +^ C ) = ( sup L ) by A12,A18,ORDINAL2:29
.= ( sup ( rng L ) );
then B = ( A +^ C ) by A11,A17,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis;
end;
now
assume C = ( {} );
then ( A +^ C ) = A by ORDINAL2:27;
hence B = A by A8,A11,XBOOLE_0:def 10
.= ( A +^ ( {} ) ) by ORDINAL2:27;
end;
hence thesis by A13;
end;
A21: P[ ( {} ) ]
proof
assume A c= ( {} );
then A = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_1:3;
then ( {} ) = ( A +^ ( {} ) ) by ORDINAL2:30;
hence thesis;
end;
(for B holds P[ B ]) from ORDINAL2:sch 1(A21,A1,A6);
hence thesis;
