theorem
Th11: (a <= b implies (for t1,t2 being (Point of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) )) holds ( L[01] (t1,t2) ) is  continuous))
proof
assume A1: a <= b;
let t1 being (Point of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) ));
let t2 being (Point of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) ));
reconsider r1 = t1,r2 = t2 as Real by A1,CKB2:1;
deffunc U((Element of ( REAL ))) = ( ( ( r2 - r1 ) * $1 ) + r1 );
consider L being (Function of ( REAL ),( REAL )) such that A2: (for r being Real holds ( L . r ) = U(r)) from FUNCT_2:sch 4;
reconsider f = L as (Function of ( R^1 ),( R^1 )) by TOPMETR:17;
A3: (for s being (Point of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (( 0 ),1) )) holds (for w being (Point of ( R^1 )) holds (s = w implies ( ( L[01] (t1,t2) ) . s ) = ( f . w ))))
proof
let s being (Point of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (( 0 ),1) ));
let w being (Point of ( R^1 ));
reconsider r = s as Real by CKB2:1;
assume A4: s = w;
thus ( ( L[01] (t1,t2) ) . s ) = ( ( ( r2 - r1 ) * r ) + r1 ) by A1,CKB12:1
.= ( f . w ) by A2,A4;
end;
A5: [. ( 0 ),1 .] = (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (( 0 ),1) )) by TOPMETR:18;
A6: f is  continuous by A2,TOPMETR:21;
(for s being (Point of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (( 0 ),1) )) holds ( L[01] (t1,t2) ) is_continuous_at s)
proof

(for G being (Subset of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) )) holds ((G is  open & ( ( L[01] (t1,t2) ) . s ) in G) implies (ex H being (Subset of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (( 0 ),1) )) st ((H is  open & s in H) & ( ( L[01] (t1,t2) ) .: H ) c= G))))
proof
let G being (Subset of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) ));
assume G is  open;
then consider G0 being (Subset of ( R^1 )) such that A7: G0 is  open and A8: ( G0 /\ ( [#] ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) ) ) ) = G by TOPS_2:24;
A9: f is_continuous_at w by A6,TMAP_1:44;
assume ( ( L[01] (t1,t2) ) . s ) in G;
then ( f . w ) in G by A3;
then ( f . w ) in G0 by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider H0 being (Subset of ( R^1 )) such that A10: H0 is  open and A11: w in H0 and A12: ( f .: H0 ) c= G0 by A7,A9,TMAP_1:43;
now
reconsider H = ( H0 /\ ( [#] ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (( 0 ),1) ) ) ) as (Subset of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (( 0 ),1) ));
take H;
thus H is  open by A10,TOPS_2:24;
thus s in H by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
thus ( ( L[01] (t1,t2) ) .: H ) c= G
proof
let t being set;
assume t in ( ( L[01] (t1,t2) ) .: H );
then consider r being set such that r in ( dom ( L[01] (t1,t2) ) ) and A13: r in H and A14: t = ( ( L[01] (t1,t2) ) . r ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
A15: r in (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (( 0 ),1) )) by A13;
reconsider r as (Point of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (( 0 ),1) )) by A13;
r in ( dom ( L[01] (t1,t2) ) ) by A15,FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A16: t in ( ( L[01] (t1,t2) ) .: (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (( 0 ),1) )) ) by A14,FUNCT_1:def 6;
reconsider p = r as (Point of ( R^1 )) by A5,TARSKI:def 3,TOPMETR:17;
p in ( [#] ( R^1 ) );
then A17: p in ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
(t = ( f . p ) & p in H0) by A3,A13,A14,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then t in ( f .: H0 ) by A17,FUNCT_1:def 6;
