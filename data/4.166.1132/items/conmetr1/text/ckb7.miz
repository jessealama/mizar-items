theorem
Th1: (X is  satisfying_indirect_Scherungssatz iff (X is  satisfying_minor_indirect_Scherungssatz & X is  satisfying_major_indirect_Scherungssatz))
proof
A1: (X is  satisfying_indirect_Scherungssatz implies X is  satisfying_minor_indirect_Scherungssatz)
proof
assume A2: X is  satisfying_indirect_Scherungssatz;
now

and
