theorem
Lm4: (for C1,C2 being Coherence_Space holds (for X being (Subset of [: C1,( union C2 ) :]) holds ((((for x being set holds (x in X implies ( x `1 ) is  finite)) & (for a,b being  finite (Element of C1) holds (a c= b implies (for y being set holds ([ a,y ] in X implies [ b,y ] in X))))) & (for a being  finite (Element of C1) holds (for y1,y2 being set holds (([ a,y1 ] in X & [ a,y2 ] in X) implies { y1,y2 } in C2)))) implies (ex f being  U-continuous (Function of C1,C2) st (X = ( graph f ) & (for a being (Element of C1) holds ( f . a ) = ( X .: ( Fin a ) )))))))
proof
let C1 being Coherence_Space;
let C2 being Coherence_Space;
let X being (Subset of [: C1,( union C2 ) :]);
assume that
A1: (for x being set holds (x in X implies ( x `1 ) is  finite))
and
A2: (for a,b being  finite (Element of C1) holds (a c= b implies (for y being set holds ([ a,y ] in X implies [ b,y ] in X))))
and
A3: (for a being  finite (Element of C1) holds (for y1,y2 being set holds (([ a,y1 ] in X & [ a,y2 ] in X) implies { y1,y2 } in C2)));
deffunc f(set) = ( X .: ( Fin $1 ) );
consider f being Function such that A4: (( dom f ) = C1 & (for a being set holds (a in C1 implies ( f . a ) = f(a)))) from FUNCT_1:sch 3;
A5: ( rng f ) c= C2
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( rng f );
then consider a being set such that A6: a in ( dom f ) and A7: x = ( f . a ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider a as (Element of C1) by A4,A6;
A8: x = ( X .: ( Fin a ) ) by A4,A7;
now
let z being set;
let y being set;
assume z in x;
then consider z1 being set such that A9: [ z1,z ] in X and A10: z1 in ( Fin a ) by A8,RELAT_1:def 13;
assume y in x;
then consider y1 being set such that A11: [ y1,y ] in X and A12: y1 in ( Fin a ) by A8,RELAT_1:def 13;
reconsider z1,y1 as  finite (Element of C1) by A10,A12;
( z1 \/ y1 ) in ( Fin a ) by A10,A12,FINSUB_1:1;
then reconsider b = ( z1 \/ y1 ) as  finite (Element of C1);
A13: [ b,y ] in X by A2,A11,XBOOLE_1:7;
[ b,z ] in X by A2,A9,XBOOLE_1:7;
hence { z,y } in C2 by A3,A13;
end;
hence thesis by COH_SP:6;
end;
A14:now
let a being set;
let y being set;
assume that
A15: a in ( dom f )
and
A16: y in ( f . a );
y in ( X .: ( Fin a ) ) by A4,A15,A16;
then consider x being set such that A17: [ x,y ] in X and A18: x in ( Fin a ) by RELAT_1:def 13;
x c= a by A18,FINSUB_1:def 5;
then x in C1 by A4,A15,CLASSES1:def 1;
then A19: ( f . x ) = ( X .: ( Fin x ) ) by A4;
take x;
x in ( Fin x ) by A18,FINSUB_1:def 5;
hence ((x is  finite & x c= a) & y in ( f . x )) by A17,A18,A19,FINSUB_1:def 5,RELAT_1:def 13;
end;
f is  c=-monotone
proof
let a being set;
let b being set;
assume that
A20: (a in ( dom f ) & b in ( dom f ))
and
A21: a c= b;
reconsider a,b as (Element of C1) by A4,A20;
( Fin a ) c= ( Fin b ) by A21,FINSUB_1:10;
then A22: ( X .: ( Fin a ) ) c= ( X .: ( Fin b ) ) by RELAT_1:123;
( f . a ) = ( X .: ( Fin a ) ) by A4;
hence thesis by A4,A22;
end;
then reconsider f as  U-continuous (Function of C1,C2) by A4,A5,A14,CKB71:1,FUNCT_2:def 1,RELSET_1:4;
take f;
thus X = ( graph f )
proof
let a being set;
let b being set;
hereby
assume A23: [ a,b ] in X;
( [ a,b ] `1 ) = a by MCART_1:7;
then reconsider a9 = a as  finite (Element of C1) by A1,A23,ZFMISC_1:87;
a9 in ( Fin a ) by FINSUB_1:def 5;
then A24: b in ( X .: ( Fin a ) ) by A23,RELAT_1:def 13;
( f . a9 ) = ( X .: ( Fin a ) ) by A4;
hence [ a,b ] in ( graph f ) by A4,A24,CKB77:1;
end;
assume A25: [ a,b ] in ( graph f );
then reconsider a as  finite (Element of C1) by A4,CKB77:1;
A26: ( f . a ) = ( X .: ( Fin a ) ) by A4;
b in ( f . a ) by A25,CKB77:1;
then consider x being set such that A27: [ x,b ] in X and A28: x in ( Fin a ) by A26,RELAT_1:def 13;
x c= a by A28,FINSUB_1:def 5;
hence thesis by A2,A27,A28;
end;

thus thesis by A4;
