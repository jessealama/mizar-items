theorem
Lm5: (for C1,C2 being Coherence_Space holds (for X being (Subset of [: C1,( union C2 ) :]) holds ((((for x being set holds (x in X implies ( x `1 ) is  finite)) & (for a,b being (Element of C1) holds (( a \/ b ) in C1 implies (for y1,y2 being set holds (([ a,y1 ] in X & [ b,y2 ] in X) implies { y1,y2 } in C2))))) & (for a,b being (Element of C1) holds (( a \/ b ) in C1 implies (for y being set holds (([ a,y ] in X & [ b,y ] in X) implies a = b))))) implies (ex f being  U-stable (Function of C1,C2) st (X = ( Trace f ) & (for a being (Element of C1) holds ( f . a ) = ( X .: ( Fin a ) )))))))
proof
let C1 being Coherence_Space;
let C2 being Coherence_Space;
let X being (Subset of [: C1,( union C2 ) :]);
assume that
A1: (for x being set holds (x in X implies ( x `1 ) is  finite))
and
A2: (for a,b being (Element of C1) holds (( a \/ b ) in C1 implies (for y1,y2 being set holds (([ a,y1 ] in X & [ b,y2 ] in X) implies { y1,y2 } in C2))))
and
A3: (for a,b being (Element of C1) holds (( a \/ b ) in C1 implies (for y being set holds (([ a,y ] in X & [ b,y ] in X) implies a = b))));
deffunc f(set) = ( X .: ( Fin $1 ) );
consider f being Function such that A4: (( dom f ) = C1 & (for a being set holds (a in C1 implies ( f . a ) = f(a)))) from FUNCT_1:sch 3;
A5:now
let a being set;
let y being set;
assume that
A6: a in ( dom f )
and
A7: y in ( f . a );
reconsider a9 = a as (Element of C1) by A4,A6;
y in ( X .: ( Fin a ) ) by A4,A6,A7;
then consider x being set such that A8: [ x,y ] in X and A9: x in ( Fin a ) by RELAT_1:def 13;
x c= a by A9,FINSUB_1:def 5;
then x in C1 by A4,A6,CLASSES1:def 1;
then A10: ( f . x ) = ( X .: ( Fin x ) ) by A4;
take x;
x in ( Fin x ) by A9,FINSUB_1:def 5;
hence ((x is  finite & x c= a) & y in ( f . x )) by A8,A9,A10,FINSUB_1:def 5,RELAT_1:def 13;
let c being set;
assume that
A11: c c= a
and
A12: y in ( f . c );
c c= a9 by A11;
then c in ( dom f ) by A4,CLASSES1:def 1;
then y in ( X .: ( Fin c ) ) by A4,A12;
then consider z being set such that A13: [ z,y ] in X and A14: z in ( Fin c ) by RELAT_1:def 13;
A15: ( Fin c ) c= ( Fin a ) by A11,FINSUB_1:10;
then A16: z in ( Fin a9 ) by A14;
( x \/ z ) in ( Fin a9 ) by A9,A14,A15,FINSUB_1:1;
then x = z by A3,A8,A9,A13,A16;
hence x c= c by A14,FINSUB_1:def 5;
end;
A17: ( rng f ) c= C2
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( rng f );
then consider a being set such that A18: a in ( dom f ) and A19: x = ( f . a ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider a as (Element of C1) by A4,A18;
A20: x = ( X .: ( Fin a ) ) by A4,A19;
now
let z being set;
let y being set;
assume z in x;
then consider z1 being set such that A21: [ z1,z ] in X and A22: z1 in ( Fin a ) by A20,RELAT_1:def 13;
assume y in x;
then consider y1 being set such that A23: [ y1,y ] in X and A24: y1 in ( Fin a ) by A20,RELAT_1:def 13;
( z1 \/ y1 ) in ( Fin a ) by A22,A24,FINSUB_1:1;
hence { z,y } in C2 by A2,A21,A22,A23,A24;
end;
hence thesis by COH_SP:6;
end;
f is  c=-monotone
proof
let a being set;
let b being set;
assume that
A25: (a in ( dom f ) & b in ( dom f ))
and
A26: a c= b;
reconsider a,b as (Element of C1) by A4,A25;
( Fin a ) c= ( Fin b ) by A26,FINSUB_1:10;
then A27: ( X .: ( Fin a ) ) c= ( X .: ( Fin b ) ) by RELAT_1:123;
( f . a ) = ( X .: ( Fin a ) ) by A4;
hence thesis by A4,A27;
end;
then reconsider f as  U-stable (Function of C1,C2) by A4,A17,A5,CKB72:1,FUNCT_2:def 1,RELSET_1:4;
take f;
thus X = ( Trace f )
proof
let a being set;
let b being set;
hereby
assume A28: [ a,b ] in X;
( [ a,b ] `1 ) = a by MCART_1:7;
then reconsider a9 = a as  finite (Element of C1) by A1,A28,ZFMISC_1:87;
a9 in ( Fin a ) by FINSUB_1:def 5;
then A29: b in ( X .: ( Fin a ) ) by A28,RELAT_1:def 13;
A30:now
let c being set;
assume that
A31: c in ( dom f )
and
A32: c c= a9
and
A33: b in ( f . c );
reconsider c9 = c as (Element of C1) by A4,A31;
b in ( X .: ( Fin c9 ) ) by A4,A33;
then consider x being set such that A34: [ x,b ] in X and A35: x in ( Fin c9 ) by RELAT_1:def 13;
A36: x c= c by A35,FINSUB_1:def 5;
then ( x \/ a9 ) = a9 by A32,XBOOLE_1:1,XBOOLE_1:12;
then x = a by A3,A28,A34,A35;
hence a9 = c by A32,A36,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
( f . a9 ) = ( X .: ( Fin a ) ) by A4;
hence [ a,b ] in ( Trace f ) by A4,A29,A30,CKB86:1;
end;
assume A37: [ a,b ] in ( Trace f );
then (a in ( dom f ) & b in ( f . a )) by CKB86:1;
then b in ( X .: ( Fin a ) ) by A4;
then consider x being set such that A38: [ x,b ] in X and A39: x in ( Fin a ) by RELAT_1:def 13;
reconsider a as (Element of C1) by A4,A37,CKB86:1;
x in ( Fin a ) by A39;
then reconsider x as  finite (Element of C1);
x in ( Fin x ) by FINSUB_1:def 5;
then b in ( X .: ( Fin x ) ) by A38,RELAT_1:def 13;
then A40: b in ( f . x ) by A4;
x c= a by A39,FINSUB_1:def 5;
hence thesis by A4,A37,A38,A40,CKB86:1;
end;

thus thesis by A4;
