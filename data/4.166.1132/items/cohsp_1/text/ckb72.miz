theorem
Th23: (for f being Function holds (( dom f ) is  subset-closed  d.union-closed implies (f is  U-stable iff (f is  c=-monotone & (for a,y being set holds ((a in ( dom f ) & y in ( f . a )) implies (ex b being set st (((b is  finite & b c= a) & y in ( f . b )) & (for c being set holds ((c c= a & y in ( f . c )) implies b c= c))))))))))
proof
let f being Function;
assume that
A1: ( dom f ) is  subset-closed  d.union-closed;
reconsider C = ( dom f ) as  subset-closed  d.union-closed set by A1;
hereby
assume f is  U-stable;
then reconsider f9 = f as  U-stable Function;
( dom f9 ) is  multiplicative;
hence f is  c=-monotone;
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
$1 c= $2;
let a being set;
let y being set;
set C = ( dom f9 );
assume that
A2: a in ( dom f )
and
A3: y in ( f . a );
consider b being set such that A4: b is  finite and A5: b c= a and A6: y in ( f9 . b ) by A1,A2,A3,CKB71:1;
b c= b;
then b in { c where c is (Subset of b): y in ( f . c ) } by A6;
then reconsider A = { c where c is (Subset of b): y in ( f . c ) } as non  empty set;
A7: (( bool b ) is  finite & A c= ( bool b ))
proof
thus ( bool b ) is  finite by A4;
let x being set;
assume x in A;
then (ex c being (Subset of b) st (x = c & y in ( f . c )));
hence thesis;
end;
A8: (for x,y,z being set holds ((P[ x,y ] & P[ y,z ]) implies P[ x,z ])) by XBOOLE_1:1;
A9: (for x,y being set holds ((P[ x,y ] & P[ y,x ]) implies x = y)) by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
reconsider A as  finite non  empty set by A7;
A10: A <> ( {} );
consider c being set such that A11: (c in A & (for y being set holds ((y in A & y <> c) implies (not P[ y,c ])))) from CARD_2:sch 1(A10,A9,A8);
(ex d being (Subset of b) st (c = d & y in ( f . d ))) by A11;
then reconsider c9 = c as (Subset of b);
reconsider c9 as  finite (Subset of b) by A4;
take c;
A12: (ex d being (Subset of b) st (c = d & y in ( f . d ))) by A11;
hence A13: ((c is  finite & c c= a) & y in ( f . c )) by A4,A5,XBOOLE_1:1;
then A14: c9 in C by A1,A2,CLASSES1:def 1;
let d being set;
assume that
A15: d c= a
and
A16: y in ( f . d );
A17: d in C by A1,A2,A15,CLASSES1:def 1;
( c \/ d ) c= a by A13,A15,XBOOLE_1:8;
then A18: ( c \/ d ) in ( dom f ) by A1,A2,CLASSES1:def 1;
A19: ( c /\ d ) c= c9 by XBOOLE_1:17;
then ( c /\ d ) in ( dom f ) by A1,A14,CLASSES1:def 1;
then ( dom f ) includes_lattice_of c,d by A14,A17,A18,CKB44:1;
then ( f . ( c /\ d ) ) = ( ( f . c ) /\ ( f . d ) ) by A14,CKB48:def 1;
then A20: y in ( f . ( c /\ d ) ) by A12,A16,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
( c /\ d ) is  finite  finite (Subset of b) by A19,XBOOLE_1:1;
then (( c /\ d ) c= d & ( c /\ d ) in A) by A20,XBOOLE_1:17;
hence c c= d by A11,XBOOLE_1:17;
end;
assume that
A21: f is  c=-monotone
and
A22: (for a,y being set holds ((a in ( dom f ) & y in ( f . a )) implies (ex b being set st (((b is  finite & b c= a) & y in ( f . b )) & (for c being set holds ((c c= a & y in ( f . c )) implies b c= c))))));
C is  subset-closed  subset-closed set;
hence ( dom f ) is  multiplicative;
now
let a being set;
let y being set;
assume (a in ( dom f ) & y in ( f . a ));
then (ex b being set st (((b is  finite & b c= a) & y in ( f . b )) & (for c being set holds ((c c= a & y in ( f . c )) implies b c= c)))) by A22;
hence (ex b being set st ((b is  finite & b c= a) & y in ( f . b )));
end;
hence f is  U-continuous by A1,A21,CKB71:1;
thus f is  cap-distributive
proof
let a being set;
let b being set;
A23: ( a /\ b ) c= b by XBOOLE_1:17;
assume A24: ( dom f ) includes_lattice_of a,b;
then A25: ( a /\ b ) in ( dom f ) by CKB44:1;
b in ( dom f ) by A24,CKB44:1;
then A26: ( f . ( a /\ b ) ) c= ( f . b ) by A21,A25,A23,CKB47:def 1;
A27: a in ( dom f ) by A24,CKB44:1;
( a /\ b ) c= a by XBOOLE_1:17;
then ( f . ( a /\ b ) ) c= ( f . a ) by A21,A27,A25,CKB47:def 1;
hence ( f . ( a /\ b ) ) c= ( ( f . a ) /\ ( f . b ) ) by A26,XBOOLE_1:19;
let x being set;
assume A28: x in ( ( f . a ) /\ ( f . b ) );
then A29: x in ( f . a ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A30: ( a \/ b ) in ( dom f ) by A24,CKB44:1;
a c= ( a \/ b ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
then ( f . a ) c= ( f . ( a \/ b ) ) by A21,A27,A30,CKB47:def 1;
then consider c being set such that c is  finite and c c= ( a \/ b ) and A31: x in ( f . c ) and A32: (for d being set holds ((d c= ( a \/ b ) & x in ( f . d )) implies c c= d)) by A22,A30,A29;
A33: c c= a by A29,A32,XBOOLE_1:7;
x in ( f . b ) by A28,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then c c= b by A32,XBOOLE_1:7;
then A34: c c= ( a /\ b ) by A33,XBOOLE_1:19;
C = ( dom f );
then c in ( dom f ) by A27,A33,CLASSES1:def 1;
then ( f . c ) c= ( f . ( a /\ b ) ) by A21,A25,A34,CKB47:def 1;
hence thesis by A31;
