theorem
Th3: (for D being (Subset of [: T1,T2 :]) holds (D is  open implies (for x1 being (Point of T1) holds (for x2 being (Point of T2) holds (for X1 being (Subset of T1) holds (for X2 being (Subset of T2) holds ((X1 = ( ( pr1 ((the carrier of T1),(the carrier of T2)) ) .: ( D /\ [: (the carrier of T1),{ x2 } :] ) ) implies X1 is  open) & (X2 = ( ( pr2 ((the carrier of T1),(the carrier of T2)) ) .: ( D /\ [: { x1 },(the carrier of T2) :] ) ) implies X2 is  open))))))))
proof
set cT1 = (the carrier of T1);
set cT2 = (the carrier of T2);
let D being (Subset of [: T1,T2 :]);
assume D is  open;
then consider FA being (Subset-Family of [: T1,T2 :]) such that A1: D = ( union FA ) and A2: (for B being set holds (B in FA implies (ex B1 being (Subset of T1) st (ex B2 being (Subset of T2) st ((B = [: B1,B2 :] & B1 is  open) & B2 is  open))))) by BORSUK_1:5;
let x1 being (Point of T1);
let x2 being (Point of T2);
let X1 being (Subset of T1);
let X2 being (Subset of T2);
thus (X1 = ( ( pr1 (cT1,cT2) ) .: ( D /\ [: cT1,{ x2 } :] ) ) implies X1 is  open)
proof
assume A3: X1 = ( ( pr1 (cT1,cT2) ) .: ( D /\ [: cT1,{ x2 } :] ) );
(for t being set holds (t in X1 iff (ex U being (Subset of T1) st ((U is  open & U c= X1) & t in U))))
proof
let t being set;
(t in X1 implies (ex U being (Subset of T1) st ((U is  open & U c= X1) & t in U)))
proof
assume t in X1;

take tX1;
thus tX1 is  open by A10;
consider tx1,tx2 being set such that A11: (tx1 in cT1 & tx2 in cT2) and A12: tx = [ tx1,tx2 ] by A4,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
thus tX1 c= X1
proof
tx in [: cT1,{ x2 } :] by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A13: tx2 = x2 by A12,ZFMISC_1:106;
let a being set;
assume that
A14: a in tX1;

hence thesis by A3,A14,FUNCT_3:def 4;
end;

( ( pr1 (cT1,cT2) ) . (tx1,tx2) ) = tx1 by A11,FUNCT_3:def 4;
hence thesis by A6,A12,A7,A9,ZFMISC_1:87;

hence thesis;

hence thesis by TOPS_1:25;

A28: tX2 c= X2
