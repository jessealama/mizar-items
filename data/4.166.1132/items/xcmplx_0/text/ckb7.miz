definition
let x being  complex number;
let y being  complex number;
x in ( COMPLEX ) by CKB2:def 1;
then consider x1,x2 being (Element of ( REAL )) such that A1: x = [* x1,x2 *] by ARYTM_0:9;
y in ( COMPLEX ) by CKB2:def 1;
then consider y1,y2 being (Element of ( REAL )) such that A2: y = [* y1,y2 *] by ARYTM_0:9;
func x + y means 
:Def4: (ex x1,x2,y1,y2 being (Element of ( REAL )) st ((x = [* x1,x2 *] & y = [* y1,y2 *]) & it = [* ( + (x1,y1) ),( + (x2,y2) ) *]));
existence
proof
take [* ( + (x1,y1) ),( + (x2,y2) ) *];
thus thesis by A1,A2;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let c1 being number;
let c2 being number;
given x1 being (Element of ( REAL )),x2 being (Element of ( REAL )),y1 being (Element of ( REAL )),y2 being (Element of ( REAL )) such that
A3: x = [* x1,x2 *]
and
A4: y = [* y1,y2 *]
and
A5: c1 = [* ( + (x1,y1) ),( + (x2,y2) ) *];

given x19 being (Element of ( REAL )),x29 being (Element of ( REAL )),y19 being (Element of ( REAL )),y29 being (Element of ( REAL )) such that
A6: x = [* x19,x29 *]
and
A7: y = [* y19,y29 *]
and
A8: c2 = [* ( + (x19,y19) ),( + (x29,y29) ) *];

A9: (x1 = x19 & x2 = x29) by A3,A6,ARYTM_0:10;
y1 = y19 by A4,A7,ARYTM_0:10;
hence thesis by A4,A5,A7,A8,A9,ARYTM_0:10;
