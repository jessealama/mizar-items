theorem
Lm2: (for x,y,z being (Element of ( REAL )) holds ((( + (x,y) ) = ( 0 ) & ( + (x,z) ) = ( 0 )) implies y = z))
proof
let x being (Element of ( REAL ));
let y being (Element of ( REAL ));
let z being (Element of ( REAL ));
assume that
A1: ( + (x,y) ) = ( 0 )
and
A2: ( + (x,z) ) = ( 0 );
per cases ;
suppose ((x in ( REAL+ ) & y in ( REAL+ )) & z in ( REAL+ ));

then ((ex x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = x9 & y = y9) & ( 0 ) = ( x9 + y9 ))) & (ex x9,y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) st ((x = x9 & z = y9) & ( 0 ) = ( x9 + y9 )))) by A1,A2,ARYTM_0:def 1;
hence thesis by ARYTM_2:11;
end;
suppose that A3: x in ( REAL+ )
and
A4: y in ( REAL+ )
and
A5: z in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :];

consider x99,y99 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A7: x = x99 and A8: (z = [ ( 0 ),y99 ] & ( 0 ) = ( x99 - y99 )) by A2,A3,A5,ARYTM_0:def 1;
A9: x99 = ( 0 ) by A6,A7,ARYTM_2:5;
