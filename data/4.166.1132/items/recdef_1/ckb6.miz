provided
A1: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ((1 <= n & n < N()) implies (for x being (Element of D()) holds (ex y being (Element of D()) st P[ n,x,y ]))))
proof
set 00 = the (Element of D());
defpred Z[ (Element of ( NAT )),set,set ]
 means
(($1 < ( N() - 1 ) implies P[ ( $1 + 1 ),$2,$3 ]) & ((not $1 < ( N() - 1 )) implies $3 = 00));
A2: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for x being (Element of D()) holds (ex y being (Element of D()) st Z[ n,x,y ])))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
let x being (Element of D());
(n < ( N() - 1 ) implies thesis)
proof
assume A3: n < ( N() - 1 );
then ( n + 1 ) < N() by XREAL_1:20;
then consider y being (Element of D()) such that A4: P[ ( n + 1 ),x,y ] by A1,NAT_1:11;
take y;
thus (n < ( N() - 1 ) implies P[ ( n + 1 ),x,y ]) by A4;
thus thesis by A3;

 means
(for r being Real holds (r = $1 implies $2 = ( f . ( r - 1 ) )));

proof

reconsider y as (Element of ( NAT )) by A9;
A11: ( f . ( y - 1 ) ) in D()
proof
y <> ( 0 ) by A8,A9,FINSEQ_1:1;

hence ( len p ) = N() by A8,FINSEQ_1:def 3;
(N() <> ( 0 ) implies (( p . 1 ) = A() or N() = ( 0 )))
proof
assume N() <> ( 0 );
then consider k being Nat such that A13: N() = ( k + 1 ) by NAT_1:6;
( ( 0 ) + 1 ) <= ( k + 1 ) by XREAL_1:7;
then 1 in ( Seg N() ) by A13,FINSEQ_1:1;
then ( p . 1 ) = ( g . 1 ) by FUNCT_1:49

hence thesis;

let n;
assume that
A14: 1 <= n

A17: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n < N() implies ( p . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( f . n )))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume n < N();
then (1 <= ( n + 1 ) & ( n + 1 ) <= N()) by NAT_1:11,NAT_1:13;
