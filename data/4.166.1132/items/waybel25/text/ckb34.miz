theorem
Th17: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (for S being non  empty (SubSpace of T) holds ( Omega S ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( Omega T ))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
let S being non  empty (SubSpace of T);
A1: (the carrier of S) c= (the carrier of T) by BORSUK_1:1;
A2: (the carrier of ( Omega S )) = (the carrier of S) by CKB21:1;
A3: (the InternalRel of ( Omega S )) c= (the InternalRel of ( Omega T ))
proof
let x being set;
let y being set;
assume A4: [ x,y ] in (the InternalRel of ( Omega S ));
then reconsider o1 = x,o2 = y as (Element of ( Omega S )) by ZFMISC_1:87;
A5: y in (the carrier of ( Omega S )) by A4,ZFMISC_1:87;
then reconsider s2 = y as (Element of S) by CKB21:1;
x in (the carrier of ( Omega S )) by A4,ZFMISC_1:87;
then reconsider o3 = x,o4 = y as (Element of ( Omega T )) by A1,A2,A5,CKB21:1;
reconsider t2 = y as (Element of T) by A1,A2,A5;
( Cl { s2 } ) = ( ( Cl { t2 } ) /\ ( [#] S ) ) by PRE_TOPC:17;
then A6: ( Cl { s2 } ) c= ( Cl { t2 } ) by XBOOLE_1:17;
o1 <= o2 by A4,ORDERS_2:def 5;
then (ex Y2 being (Subset of S) st (Y2 = { o2 } & o1 in ( Cl Y2 ))) by CKB20:def 1;
then o3 <= o4 by A6,CKB20:def 1;
hence thesis by ORDERS_2:def 5;
end;
A7: (the InternalRel of ( Omega S )) = ( (the InternalRel of ( Omega T )) |_2 (the carrier of ( Omega S )) )
proof
let x being set;
let y being set;
thus ([ x,y ] in (the InternalRel of ( Omega S )) implies [ x,y ] in ( (the InternalRel of ( Omega T )) |_2 (the carrier of ( Omega S )) )) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
assume A8: [ x,y ] in ( (the InternalRel of ( Omega T )) |_2 (the carrier of ( Omega S )) );
then A9: y in (the carrier of ( Omega S )) by ZFMISC_1:87;
A10: x in (the carrier of ( Omega S )) by A8,ZFMISC_1:87;
then reconsider t1 = x,t2 = y as (Element of T) by A1,A2,A9;
reconsider o1 = x,o2 = y as (Element of ( Omega T )) by A1,A2,A10,A9,CKB21:1;
[ x,y ] in (the InternalRel of ( Omega T )) by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then o1 <= o2 by ORDERS_2:def 5;
then A11: (ex Y being (Subset of T) st (Y = { t2 } & t1 in ( Cl Y ))) by CKB20:def 1;
reconsider s1 = x,s2 = y as (Element of S) by A10,A9,CKB21:1;
reconsider o3 = x,o4 = y as (Element of ( Omega S )) by A8,ZFMISC_1:87;
( Cl { s2 } ) = ( ( Cl { t2 } ) /\ ( [#] S ) ) by PRE_TOPC:17;
then s1 in ( Cl { s2 } ) by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then o3 <= o4 by CKB20:def 1;
hence thesis by ORDERS_2:def 5;
end;
(the carrier of ( Omega S )) c= (the carrier of ( Omega T )) by A1,A2,CKB21:1;
hence thesis by A3,A7,YELLOW_0:def 13,YELLOW_0:def 14;
