theorem
Th26: (for X being non  empty TopSpace holds (for Y being T_0-TopSpace holds (for N being (net of ( ContMaps (X,( Omega Y )) )) holds ((for x being (Point of X) holds  ex_sup_of ( commute (N,x,( Omega Y )) )) implies  ex_sup_of ( rng (the mapping of N) ),( ( Omega Y ) |^ (the carrier of X) )))))
proof
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
let Y being T_0-TopSpace;
let N being (net of ( ContMaps (X,( Omega Y )) ));
assume that
A1: (for x being (Point of X) holds  ex_sup_of ( commute (N,x,( Omega Y )) ));
deffunc F((Element of X)) = ( sup ( commute (N,$1,( Omega Y )) ) );
set n = (the mapping of N);
set L = ( ( Omega Y ) |^ (the carrier of X) );
consider f being (Function of (the carrier of X),(the carrier of ( Omega Y ))) such that A2: (for u being (Element of X) holds ( f . u ) = F(u)) from FUNCT_2:sch 4;
reconsider a = f as (Element of L) by WAYBEL24:19;
(ex a being (Element of L) st (( rng n ) is_<=_than a & (for b being (Element of L) holds (( rng n ) is_<=_than b implies a <= b))))
proof
take a;
A3: ( dom n ) = (the carrier of N) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A4: L = ( product ( (the carrier of X) --> ( Omega Y ) ) ) by YELLOW_1:def 5;
thus ( rng n ) is_<=_than a
proof
let k being (Element of L);
reconsider k9 = k,a9 = a as (Element of ( product ( (the carrier of X) --> ( Omega Y ) ) )) by YELLOW_1:def 5;
assume k in ( rng n );
then consider i being set such that A5: i in ( dom n ) and A6: k = ( n . i ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider i as (Point of N) by A5;
(for u being (Element of X) holds ( k9 . u ) <= ( a9 . u ))
proof
let u being (Element of X);
A7: ( Omega Y ) = ( ( (the carrier of X) --> ( Omega Y ) ) . u ) by FUNCOP_1:7;
 ex_sup_of ( commute (N,u,( Omega Y )) ) by A1;

A9: ( k9 . u ) = ( (the mapping of ( commute (N,u,( Omega Y )) )) . i ) by A6,CKB48:1;
( dom (the mapping of ( commute (N,u,( Omega Y )) )) ) = (the carrier of N) by A3,Lm6;

hence thesis by A7,A8,A10,YELLOW_4:1;

(for u being (Element of X) holds ( a9 . u ) <= ( b9 . u ))
proof
let u being (Element of X);
 ex_sup_of ( commute (N,u,( Omega Y )) ) by A1;

A14: ( rng (the mapping of ( commute (N,u,( Omega Y )) )) ) is_<=_than ( b . u )
proof
let s being (Element of ( Omega Y ));
assume s in ( rng (the mapping of ( commute (N,u,( Omega Y )) )) );
then consider i being set such that A15: i in ( dom (the mapping of ( commute (N,u,( Omega Y )) )) ) and A16: ( (the mapping of ( commute (N,u,( Omega Y )) )) . i ) = s by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider i as (Point of N) by A3,A15,Lm6;
( n . i ) is (Function of X,( Omega Y )) by WAYBEL24:21;
then reconsider k = ( n . i ) as (Element of L) by WAYBEL24:19;
reconsider k9 = k as (Element of ( product ( (the carrier of X) --> ( Omega Y ) ) )) by YELLOW_1:def 5;
( n . i ) in ( rng n ) by A3,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then k <= b by A11;
then A17: k9 <= b9 by YELLOW_1:def 5;
s = ( ( n . i ) . u ) by A16,CKB48:1;
hence s <= ( b . u ) by A13,A17,WAYBEL_3:28;
end;
( a9 . u ) = ( sup ( commute (N,u,( Omega Y )) ) ) by A2

hence thesis by A13,A12,A14,YELLOW_0:30;
