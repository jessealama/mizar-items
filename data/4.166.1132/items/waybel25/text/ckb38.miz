theorem
Th20: (for T being  injective T_0-TopSpace holds ( Omega T ) is  complete  continuous  complete  continuous LATTICE)
proof
let T being  injective T_0-TopSpace;
set S = ( Sierpinski_Space );
set B = ( BoolePoset 1 );
consider M being non  empty set such that A1: T is_Retract_of ( product ( M --> S ) ) by WAYBEL18:19;
consider f being (Function of ( product ( M --> S ) ),( product ( M --> S ) )) such that A2: f is  continuous and A3: ( f * f ) = f and A4: ( Image f ),T are_homeomorphic  by A1,WAYBEL18:def 8;
A5: ( the RelStr of ( Omega ( Image f ) ) ),( Omega ( Image f ) ) are_isomorphic  by WAYBEL13:26;
( Omega ( Image f ) ),( Omega T ) are_isomorphic  by A4,CKB36:1;
then A6: ( the RelStr of ( Omega ( Image f ) ) ),( Omega T ) are_isomorphic  by A5,WAYBEL_1:7;
( Omega ( Image f ) ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( Omega ( product ( M --> S ) ) )) by CKB34:1;
then A7: (the InternalRel of ( Omega ( Image f ) )) = ( (the InternalRel of ( Omega ( product ( M --> S ) ) )) |_2 (the carrier of ( Omega ( Image f ) )) ) by YELLOW_0:def 14;
set TL = the  Scott (TopAugmentation of ( product ( M --> B ) ));
A8: ( the RelStr of TL ) = ( the RelStr of ( product ( M --> B ) ) ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
A9: (the carrier of TL) = (the carrier of ( product ( M --> S ) )) by CKB7:1;
then reconsider ff = f as (Function of TL,TL);
A10: (the topology of TL) = (the topology of ( product ( M --> S ) )) by WAYBEL18:15;
then A11: ff is  continuous by A2,A9,YELLOW12:36;
then ff is  idempotent  monotone by A3,QUANTAL1:def 9;
then ff is  projection by WAYBEL_1:def 13;
then reconsider g = ff as  projection (Function of ( product ( M --> B ) ),( product ( M --> B ) )) by A8,CKB37:1;
A12: (the InternalRel of ( Image g )) = ( (the InternalRel of ( product ( M --> B ) )) |_2 (the carrier of ( Image g )) ) by YELLOW_0:def 14;
(( the TopStruct of ( the TopStruct of TL ) ) = ( the TopStruct of TL ) implies ( Omega ( the TopStruct of TL ) ) = ( Omega TL )) by CKB29:1;
then A13: ( the RelStr of ( Omega ( the TopStruct of ( product ( M --> S ) ) ) ) ) = ( the RelStr of ( product ( M --> B ) ) ) by A10,A9,CKB32:1;
g is  directed-sups-preserving by A8,A11,WAYBEL21:6;
then A14: ( Image g ) is  complete  continuous  complete  continuous LATTICE by WAYBEL15:15,YELLOW_2:35;
(the carrier of ( Image g )) = ( rng g ) by YELLOW_0:def 15
.= (the carrier of ( Image f )) by WAYBEL18:9
.= (the carrier of ( Omega ( Image f ) )) by CKB21:1;
hence thesis by A13,A14,A6,A12,A7,WAYBEL15:9,WAYBEL20:18,YELLOW14:11,YELLOW14:12;
