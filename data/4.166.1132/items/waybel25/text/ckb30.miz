theorem
(for M being non  empty set holds (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds ( the RelStr of ( Omega ( product ( M --> T ) ) ) ) = ( the RelStr of ( product ( M --> ( Omega T ) ) ) )))
proof
let M being non  empty set;
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
A1: ( dom ( Carrier ( M --> T ) ) ) = M by PARTFUN1:def 2
.= ( dom ( Carrier ( M --> ( Omega T ) ) ) ) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
A2: (for i being set holds (i in ( dom ( Carrier ( M --> T ) ) ) implies ( ( Carrier ( M --> T ) ) . i ) = ( ( Carrier ( M --> ( Omega T ) ) ) . i )))
proof
let i being set;
assume i in ( dom ( Carrier ( M --> T ) ) );
then A3: i in M by PARTFUN1:def 2;
then consider R1 being 1-sorted such that A4: R1 = ( ( M --> T ) . i ) and A5: ( ( Carrier ( M --> T ) ) . i ) = (the carrier of R1) by PRALG_1:def 13;
consider R2 being 1-sorted such that A6: R2 = ( ( M --> ( Omega T ) ) . i ) and A7: ( ( Carrier ( M --> ( Omega T ) ) ) . i ) = (the carrier of R2) by A3,PRALG_1:def 13;
(the carrier of R1) = (the carrier of T) by A3,A4,FUNCOP_1:7
.= (the carrier of ( Omega T )) by CKB21:1
.= (the carrier of R2) by A3,A6,FUNCOP_1:7;
hence thesis by A5,A7;

proof
let x being set;

xo <= yo by A10,ORDERS_2:def 5;
then A16: (ex Yp being (Subset of ( product ( M --> T ) )) st (Yp = { p2 } & p1 in ( Cl Yp ))) by CKB20:def 1;

proof
let i being set;

reconsider xi = t1,yi = t2 as (Element of ( Omega T )) by CKB21:1;
take ( Omega T );
take xi;
take yi;
thus ( Omega T ) = ( ( M --> ( Omega T ) ) . i ) by A17,FUNCOP_1:7;
thus xi = ( f . i ) by A14;
thus yi = ( g . i ) by A15;
( p1 . j ) in ( Cl { ( p2 . j ) } ) by A16,YELLOW14:30;
hence xi <= yi by CKB20:def 1;

(for i being (Element of M) holds ( p1 . i ) in ( Cl { ( p2 . i ) } ))
proof
let i being (Element of M);
consider R1 being RelStr,xi,yi being (Element of R1) such that A25: R1 = ( ( M --> ( Omega T ) ) . i ) and A26: xi = ( f . i ) and A27: yi = ( g . i ) and A28: xi <= yi by A23;
reconsider xi,yi as (Element of ( Omega T )) by A25,FUNCOP_1:7;
xi <= yi by A25,A28,FUNCOP_1:7;
then (ex Y being (Subset of T) st (Y = { yi } & xi in ( Cl Y ))) by CKB20:def 1;
hence thesis by A21,A22,A26,A27;
