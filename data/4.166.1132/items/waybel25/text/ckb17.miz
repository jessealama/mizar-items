theorem
Th12: (for L being  complete  continuous LATTICE holds (for T being  Scott (TopAugmentation of L) holds T is  injective))
proof
let L being  complete  continuous LATTICE;
let T being  Scott (TopAugmentation of L);
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
let f being (Function of X,T);
assume that
A1: f is  continuous;
let Y being non  empty TopSpace;
assume that
A2: X is (SubSpace of Y);
deffunc F(set) = ( "\/" ({ ( inf ( f .: ( V /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) ) where V is  open (Subset of Y): $1 in V },T) );
consider g being (Function of (the carrier of Y),(the carrier of T)) such that A3: (for x being (Element of Y) holds ( g . x ) = F(x)) from FUNCT_2:sch 4;
reconsider g as (Function of Y,T);
take g;
A4: ( dom f ) = (the carrier of X) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A5: (for P being (Subset of T) holds (P is  open implies ( g " P ) is  open))
proof
let P being (Subset of T);
assume P is  open;
then reconsider P as  open (Subset of T);
(for x being set holds (x in ( g " P ) iff (ex Q being (Subset of Y) st ((Q is  open & Q c= ( g " P )) & x in Q))))
proof
let x being set;
thus (x in ( g " P ) implies (ex Q being (Subset of Y) st ((Q is  open & Q c= ( g " P )) & x in Q)))
proof
assume A6: x in ( g " P );
then reconsider y = x as (Point of Y);
set A = { ( inf ( f .: ( V /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) ) where V is  open (Subset of Y): y in V };
A c= (the carrier of T)
proof
let a being set;
assume a in A;
then (ex V being  open (Subset of Y) st (a = ( inf ( f .: ( V /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) ) & y in V));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider A as (Subset of T);
A7: ( inf ( f .: ( ( [#] Y ) /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) ) in A;
A8: A is  directed
proof
let a being (Element of T);
let b being (Element of T);
assume a in A;
then consider Va being  open (Subset of Y) such that A9: a = ( inf ( f .: ( Va /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) ) and A10: y in Va;
assume b in A;
then consider Vb being  open (Subset of Y) such that A11: b = ( inf ( f .: ( Vb /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) ) and A12: y in Vb;
take ( inf ( f .: ( ( Va /\ Vb ) /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) );
y in ( Va /\ Vb ) by A10,A12,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence ( inf ( f .: ( ( Va /\ Vb ) /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) ) in A;
( ( Va /\ Vb ) /\ (the carrier of X) ) c= ( Vb /\ (the carrier of X) ) by XBOOLE_1:17,XBOOLE_1:26;
then A13: ( f .: ( ( Va /\ Vb ) /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) c= ( f .: ( Vb /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) by RELAT_1:123;
( ( Va /\ Vb ) /\ (the carrier of X) ) c= ( Va /\ (the carrier of X) ) by XBOOLE_1:17,XBOOLE_1:26;
then ( f .: ( ( Va /\ Vb ) /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) c= ( f .: ( Va /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) by RELAT_1:123;
hence thesis by A9,A11,A13,WAYBEL_7:1;
end;
A14: ( g . y ) = ( sup A ) by A3;
( g . y ) in P by A6,FUNCT_2:38;
then A meets P by A14,A7,A8,WAYBEL11:def 1;
then consider b being set such that A15: b in A and A16: b in P by XBOOLE_0:3;
consider B being  open (Subset of Y) such that A17: b = ( inf ( f .: ( B /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) ) and A18: y in B by A15;
reconsider b as (Element of T) by A17;
take B;
thus B is  open;
thus B c= ( g " P )
proof
let a being set;
assume A19: a in B;
then reconsider a as (Point of Y);
A20: ( g . a ) = F(a) by A3;
b in { ( inf ( f .: ( V /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) ) where V is  open (Subset of Y): a in V } by A17,A19;
then b <= ( g . a ) by A20,YELLOW_2:22;
then ( g . a ) in P by A16,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:38;

thus thesis by A18;

proof
let a being set;

A24: ( f . x ) is_>=_than A
proof
let z being (Element of T);

end;
A28: (for b being (Element of T) holds (b is_>=_than A implies ( f . x ) <= b))
proof
let b being (Element of T);
assume that
A29: (for k being (Element of T) holds (k in A implies k <= b));
A30: (for V being  open (Subset of X) holds (x in V implies ( inf ( f .: V ) ) <= b))
proof
let V being  open (Subset of X);
V in (the topology of X) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then consider Q being (Subset of Y) such that A31: Q in (the topology of Y) and A32: V = ( Q /\ ( [#] X ) ) by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
reconsider Q as  open (Subset of Y) by A31,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
assume x in V;
then y in Q by A32,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then ( inf ( f .: ( Q /\ (the carrier of X) ) ) ) in A;
hence thesis by A29,A32;
end;
A33: b is_>=_than ( waybelow ( f . x ) )
proof
let w being (Element of T);
A34: ( wayabove w ) is  open by WAYBEL11:36;
A35:  ex_inf_of ( f .: ( f " ( wayabove w ) ) ),T by YELLOW_0:17;
A36: w <= ( inf ( wayabove w ) ) by WAYBEL14:9;
 ex_inf_of ( wayabove w ),T by YELLOW_0:17;
then ( inf ( wayabove w ) ) <= ( inf ( f .: ( f " ( wayabove w ) ) ) ) by A35,FUNCT_1:75,YELLOW_0:35;
then A37: w <= ( inf ( f .: ( f " ( wayabove w ) ) ) ) by A36,ORDERS_2:3;
assume w in ( waybelow ( f . x ) );
then w << ( f . x ) by WAYBEL_3:7;
then ( f . x ) in ( wayabove w ) by WAYBEL_3:8;
then A38: x in ( f " ( wayabove w ) ) by FUNCT_2:38;
( [#] T ) <> ( {} );
then ( f " ( wayabove w ) ) is  open by A1,A34,TOPS_2:43;
then ( inf ( f .: ( f " ( wayabove w ) ) ) ) <= b by A30,A38;
hence w <= b by A37,ORDERS_2:3;
end;
( f . x ) = ( sup ( waybelow ( f . x ) ) ) by WAYBEL_3:def 5;
hence thesis by A33,YELLOW_0:32;
