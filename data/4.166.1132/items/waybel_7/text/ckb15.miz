theorem
Th15: (for X being set holds (for Y being non  empty  upper (Subset of ( BoolePoset X )) holds (Y is  filtered iff (for Z being  finite (Subset-Family of X) holds (Z c= Y implies ( Intersect Z ) in Y)))))
proof
let X being set;
let Y being non  empty  upper (Subset of ( BoolePoset X ));
hereby
assume A1: Y is  filtered;
then ( Top ( BoolePoset X ) ) in Y by WAYBEL_4:22;
then A2: X in Y by YELLOW_1:19;
let Z being  finite (Subset-Family of X);
reconsider B = Z as (Subset of ( BoolePoset X )) by CKB2:1;
assume Z c= Y;
then reconsider A = Z as  finite (Subset of Y);
(A <> ( {} ) implies (( inf B ) in Y & ( inf B ) = ( meet B ))) by A1,WAYBEL_0:43,YELLOW_1:20;
hence ( Intersect Z ) in Y by A2,SETFAM_1:def 9;
end;
assume A3: (for Z being  finite (Subset-Family of X) holds (Z c= Y implies ( Intersect Z ) in Y));
A4: (the carrier of ( BoolePoset X )) = ( bool X ) by CKB2:1;
now
let A being  finite (Subset of Y);
reconsider Z = A as  finite (Subset-Family of X) by A4,XBOOLE_1:1;
assume A5: A <> ( {} );
reconsider Z as  finite (Subset-Family of X);
A c= (the carrier of ( BoolePoset X )) by XBOOLE_1:1;
then ( "/\" (A,( BoolePoset X )) ) = ( meet Z ) by A5,YELLOW_1:20
.= ( Intersect Z ) by A5,SETFAM_1:def 9;
hence ( "/\" (A,( BoolePoset X )) ) in Y by A3;
end;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:43;
end;
