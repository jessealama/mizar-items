theorem
Th26: (for L being  Boolean LATTICE holds (for F being (Filter of L) holds (F is  proper  prime iff F is  ultra)))
proof
let L being  Boolean LATTICE;
let F being (Filter of L);
thus (F is  proper  prime implies F is  ultra)
proof
assume A1: F is  proper;
assume A2: (for x,y being (Element of L) holds (( x "\/" y ) in F implies (x in F or y in F)));
thus F is  proper by A1;
let G being (Filter of L);
assume that
A3: F c= G
and
A4: F <> G;
consider x being set such that A5: (not (x in F iff x in G)) by A4,TARSKI:1;
reconsider x as (Element of L) by A5;
set y = ( 'not' x );
( x "\/" y ) = ( Top L ) by YELLOW_5:34;
then y in F by A2,A3,A5,WAYBEL_4:22;
then ( x "/\" y ) in G by A3,A5,WAYBEL_0:41;
then A6: ( Bottom L ) in G by YELLOW_5:34;
thus G c= (the carrier of L);
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of L);
then reconsider x as (Element of L);
x >= ( Bottom L ) by YELLOW_0:44;
hence thesis by A6,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
end;

assume that
A7: F is  proper
and
A8: (for G being (Filter of L) holds (F c= G implies (F = G or G = (the carrier of L))));
thus F is  proper by A7;
now
let a being (Element of L);
assume that
A9: (not a in F)
and
A10: (not ( 'not' a ) in F);
set b = ( 'not' a );
A11: ( F \/ { a } ) c= ( uparrow ( fininfs ( F \/ { a } ) ) ) by WAYBEL_0:62;
({ a } c= ( F \/ { a } ) & a in { a }) by TARSKI:def 1,XBOOLE_1:7;
then a in ( F \/ { a } );
then (F c= ( F \/ { a } ) & a in ( uparrow ( fininfs ( F \/ { a } ) ) )) by A11,XBOOLE_1:7;
then ( uparrow ( fininfs ( F \/ { a } ) ) ) = (the carrier of L) by A8,A9,A11,XBOOLE_1:1;
then consider c being (Element of L) such that A12: c in F and A13: b >= ( c "/\" ( inf { a } ) ) by CKB32:1;
c <= ( Top L ) by YELLOW_0:45;
then A14: c = ( c "/\" ( Top L ) ) by YELLOW_0:25
.= ( c "/\" ( a "\/" b ) ) by YELLOW_5:34
.= ( ( c "/\" a ) "\/" ( c "/\" b ) ) by WAYBEL_1:def 3;
(( inf { a } ) = a & ( c "/\" b ) <= b) by YELLOW_0:23,YELLOW_0:39;
then c <= b by A13,A14,YELLOW_0:22;
hence contradiction by A10,A12,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
end;
hence thesis by CKB28:1;
end;
