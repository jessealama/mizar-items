theorem
(for L being  lower-bounded LATTICE holds (for R being  auxiliary (Relation of L) holds (R is  multiplicative iff ( R -below ) is  meet-preserving)))
proof
let L being  lower-bounded LATTICE;
let R being  auxiliary (Relation of L);
hereby
assume A1: R is  multiplicative;
thus ( R -below ) is  meet-preserving
proof
let x being (Element of L),y being (Element of L);
A2: ( ( R -below ) . y ) = ( R -below y ) by WAYBEL_4:def 12;
A3: ( R -below ( x "/\" y ) ) = ( ( R -below x ) /\ ( R -below y ) )
proof
hereby
let a being set;
assume a in ( R -below ( x "/\" y ) );
then a in { z where z is (Element of L): [ z,( x "/\" y ) ] in R } by WAYBEL_4:def 10;
then consider z being (Element of L) such that A4: a = z and A5: [ z,( x "/\" y ) ] in R;
A6: z <= z;
( x "/\" y ) <= y by YELLOW_0:23;
then [ z,y ] in R by A5,A6,WAYBEL_4:def 4;
then A7: z in ( R -below y ) by WAYBEL_4:13;
( x "/\" y ) <= x by YELLOW_0:23;
then [ z,x ] in R by A5,A6,WAYBEL_4:def 4;
then z in ( R -below x ) by WAYBEL_4:13;
hence a in ( ( R -below x ) /\ ( R -below y ) ) by A4,A7,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
let a being set;
assume A8: a in ( ( R -below x ) /\ ( R -below y ) );
then reconsider z = a as (Element of L);
a in ( R -below y ) by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A9: [ z,y ] in R by WAYBEL_4:13;
a in ( R -below x ) by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then [ z,x ] in R by WAYBEL_4:13;
then [ z,( x "/\" y ) ] in R by A1,A9,CKB56:def 1;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_4:13;
end;
(( ( R -below ) . ( x "/\" y ) ) = ( R -below ( x "/\" y ) ) & ( ( R -below ) . x ) = ( R -below x )) by WAYBEL_4:def 12;
then ( ( R -below ) . ( x "/\" y ) ) = ( ( ( R -below ) . x ) "/\" ( ( R -below ) . y ) ) by A2,A3,YELLOW_2:43;
hence thesis by YELLOW_3:8;
end;

end;
assume A10: (for x,y being (Element of L) holds ( R -below ) preserves_inf_of { x,y });
let a being (Element of L),x being (Element of L),y being (Element of L);
( R -below ) preserves_inf_of { x,y } by A10;
then A11: ( ( R -below ) . ( x "/\" y ) ) = ( ( ( R -below ) . x ) "/\" ( ( R -below ) . y ) ) by YELLOW_3:8
.= ( ( ( R -below ) . x ) /\ ( ( R -below ) . y ) ) by YELLOW_2:43;
A12: ( ( R -below ) . y ) = ( R -below y ) by WAYBEL_4:def 12;
assume ([ a,x ] in R & [ a,y ] in R);
then A13: (a in ( R -below x ) & a in ( R -below y )) by WAYBEL_4:13;
(( ( R -below ) . ( x "/\" y ) ) = ( R -below ( x "/\" y ) ) & ( ( R -below ) . x ) = ( R -below x )) by WAYBEL_4:def 12;
then a in ( R -below ( x "/\" y ) ) by A11,A12,A13,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_4:13;
