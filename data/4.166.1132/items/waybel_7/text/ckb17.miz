theorem
Th16: (for L being  with_infima Poset holds (for I being (Ideal of L) holds (I is  prime iff (for A being  finite non  empty (Subset of L) holds (( inf A ) in I implies (ex a being (Element of L) st (a in A & a in I)))))))
proof
let L being  with_infima Poset;
let I being (Ideal of L);
thus (I is  prime implies (for A being  finite non  empty (Subset of L) holds (( inf A ) in I implies (ex a being (Element of L) st (a in A & a in I)))))
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(($1 is non  empty & ( "/\" ($1,L) ) in I) implies (ex a being (Element of L) st (a in $1 & a in I)));
assume A1: (for x,y being (Element of L) holds (( x "/\" y ) in I implies (x in I or y in I)));
let A being  finite non  empty (Subset of L);
A2:now
let x being set;
let B being set;
assume that
A3: x in A
and
A4: B c= A
and
A5: P[ B ];
thus P[ ( B \/ { x } ) ]
proof
reconsider a = x as (Element of L) by A3;
reconsider C = B as  finite (Subset of L) by A4,XBOOLE_1:1;
assume that
( B \/ { x } ) is non  empty
and
A6: ( "/\" (( B \/ { x } ),L) ) in I;
per cases ;
suppose B = ( {} );

then (( "/\" (( B \/ { a } ),L) ) = a & a in ( B \/ { a } )) by TARSKI:def 1,YELLOW_0:39;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
suppose A7: B <> ( {} );

A8: ( inf { a } ) = a by YELLOW_0:39;
A9:  ex_inf_of { a },L by YELLOW_0:55;
 ex_inf_of C,L by A7,YELLOW_0:55;
then A10: ( "/\" (( B \/ { x } ),L) ) = ( ( inf C ) "/\" ( inf { a } ) ) by A9,YELLOW_2:4;
hereby
per cases  by A1,A6,A10,A8;
suppose ( inf C ) in I;

then consider b being (Element of L) such that A11: (b in B & b in I) by A5,A7;
take b;
thus (b in ( B \/ { x } ) & b in I) by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
suppose A12: a in I;

take a;
a in { a } by TARSKI:def 1;
hence (a in ( B \/ { x } ) & a in I) by A12,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
end;
end;
end;

end;
A13: P[ ( {} ) ];
A14: A is  finite;
P[ A ] from FINSET_1:sch 2(A14,A13,A2);
hence thesis;
end;

assume A15: (for A being  finite non  empty (Subset of L) holds (( inf A ) in I implies (ex a being (Element of L) st (a in A & a in I))));
let a being (Element of L);
let b being (Element of L);
assume ( a "/\" b ) in I;
then ( inf { a,b } ) in I by YELLOW_0:40;
then (ex x being (Element of L) st (x in { a,b } & x in I)) by A15;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 2;
