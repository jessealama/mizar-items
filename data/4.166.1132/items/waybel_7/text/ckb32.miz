theorem
Lm1: (for L being  with_infima Poset holds (for F being (Filter of L) holds (for X being  finite non empty (Subset of L) holds (for x being (Element of L) holds (x in ( uparrow ( fininfs ( F \/ X ) ) ) implies (ex a being (Element of L) st (a in F & x >= ( a "/\" ( inf X ) ))))))))
proof
let L being  with_infima Poset;
let I being (Filter of L);
let X being  finite non empty (Subset of L);
let x being (Element of L);
set i = the (Element of I);
reconsider i as (Element of L);
assume x in ( uparrow ( fininfs ( I \/ X ) ) );
then consider u being (Element of L) such that A1: u <= x and A2: u in ( fininfs ( I \/ X ) ) by WAYBEL_0:def 16;
consider Y being  finite (Subset of ( I \/ X )) such that A3: u = ( "/\" (Y,L) ) and A4:  ex_inf_of Y,L by A2;
( Y \ X ) c= I
proof
let a being set;
assume A5: a in ( Y \ X );
then (not a in X) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence thesis by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
then reconsider Z = ( Y \ X ) as  finite (Subset of I);
reconsider Z9 = Z,Y9 = Y as  finite (Subset of L) by XBOOLE_1:1;
reconsider ZX = ( Z9 \/ X ) as  finite (Subset of L);
per cases ;
suppose A6: Z = ( {} );

A7: ( inf X ) >= ( i "/\" ( inf X ) ) by YELLOW_0:23;
take i;
A8:  ex_inf_of X,L by YELLOW_0:55;
Y c= X by A6,XBOOLE_1:37;
then u >= ( inf X ) by A3,A4,A8,YELLOW_0:35;
then u >= ( i "/\" ( inf X ) ) by A7,ORDERS_2:3;
hence thesis by A1,ORDERS_2:3;
end;
suppose A9: Z <> ( {} );

take ( inf Z9 );
A10:  ex_inf_of X,L by YELLOW_0:55;
A11:  ex_inf_of ZX,L by YELLOW_0:55;
Y c= ( Y \/ X ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
then Y c= ( Z9 \/ X ) by XBOOLE_1:39;
then A12: ( inf Y9 ) >= ( inf ZX ) by A4,A11,YELLOW_0:35;
 ex_inf_of Z9,L by A9,YELLOW_0:55;
then ( inf ( Z9 \/ X ) ) = ( ( inf Z9 ) "/\" ( inf X ) ) by A10,A11,YELLOW_0:37;
hence thesis by A1,A3,A9,A12,ORDERS_2:3,WAYBEL_0:43;
