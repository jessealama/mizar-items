theorem
(for X being set holds (for Y being non  empty  lower (Subset of ( BoolePoset X )) holds (Y is  directed iff (for Z being  finite (Subset-Family of X) holds (Z c= Y implies ( union Z ) in Y)))))
proof
let X being set;
let Y being non  empty  lower (Subset of ( BoolePoset X ));
hereby
assume A1: Y is  directed;
let Z being  finite (Subset-Family of X);
reconsider B = Z as (Subset of ( BoolePoset X )) by CKB2:1;
assume Z c= Y;
then reconsider A = Z as  finite (Subset of Y);
A2: (A <> ( {} ) implies ( sup B ) in Y) by A1,WAYBEL_0:42;
( Bottom ( BoolePoset X ) ) in Y by A1,WAYBEL_4:21;
hence ( union Z ) in Y by A2,YELLOW_1:18,YELLOW_1:21,ZFMISC_1:2;
end;
assume A3: (for Z being  finite (Subset-Family of X) holds (Z c= Y implies ( union Z ) in Y));
A4: (the carrier of ( BoolePoset X )) = ( bool X ) by CKB2:1;
now
let A being  finite (Subset of Y);
reconsider Z = A as  finite (Subset-Family of X) by A4,XBOOLE_1:1;
assume A <> ( {} );
reconsider Z as  finite (Subset-Family of X);
A c= (the carrier of ( BoolePoset X )) by XBOOLE_1:1;
then ( union Z ) = ( "\/" (A,( BoolePoset X )) ) by YELLOW_1:21;
hence ( "\/" (A,( BoolePoset X )) ) in Y by A3;
end;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:42;
end;
