theorem
Th35: (( ( (the escape of N) \ ( id (the carrier of N) ) ) * ( id ( (the carrier of N) \ ( rng (the escape of N) ) ) ) ) = ( {} ) & ( ( (the entrance of N) \ ( id (the carrier of N) ) ) * ( id ( (the carrier of N) \ ( rng (the entrance of N) ) ) ) ) = ( {} ))
proof
A1: (for x holds (for y holds (not [ x,y ] in ( ( (the entrance of N) \ ( id (the carrier of N) ) ) * ( id ( (the carrier of N) \ ( rng (the entrance of N) ) ) ) ))))
proof
let x;
let y;
assume [ x,y ] in ( ( (the entrance of N) \ ( id (the carrier of N) ) ) * ( id ( (the carrier of N) \ ( rng (the entrance of N) ) ) ) );
then consider z such that A2: [ x,z ] in ( (the entrance of N) \ ( id (the carrier of N) ) ) and A3: [ z,y ] in ( id ( (the carrier of N) \ ( rng (the entrance of N) ) ) ) by RELAT_1:def 8;
