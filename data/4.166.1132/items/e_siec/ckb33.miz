theorem
Th23: ((([ x,y ] in (the entrance of N) or [ x,y ] in (the escape of N)) & x <> y) implies (x in ( e_Transitions N ) & y in ( e_Places N )))
proof
A1: (([ x,y ] in (the escape of N) & x <> y) implies (x in ( e_Transitions N ) & y in ( e_Places N )))
proof
( (the escape of N) * ( (the escape of N) \ ( id (the carrier of N) ) ) ) = ( {} ) by CKB5:def 1;
