theorem
Th24: (( (the entrance of N) \ ( id (the carrier of N) ) ) c= [: ( e_Transitions N ),( e_Places N ) :] & ( (the escape of N) \ ( id (the carrier of N) ) ) c= [: ( e_Transitions N ),( e_Places N ) :])
proof
A1: (for x holds (for y holds ([ x,y ] in ( (the entrance of N) \ ( id (the carrier of N) ) ) implies [ x,y ] in [: ( e_Transitions N ),( e_Places N ) :])))
proof
let x;
let y;
assume A2: [ x,y ] in ( (the entrance of N) \ ( id (the carrier of N) ) );
then [ x,y ] in (the entrance of N) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then A3: x in ( dom (the entrance of N) ) by RELAT_1:6;
