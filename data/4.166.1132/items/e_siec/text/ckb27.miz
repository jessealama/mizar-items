theorem
Th18: ((((( rng (the entrance of N) ) = ( rng ( CL (the entrance of N) ) ) & ( rng (the entrance of N) ) = ( dom ( CL (the entrance of N) ) )) & ( rng (the escape of N) ) = ( rng ( CL (the escape of N) ) )) & ( rng (the escape of N) ) = ( dom ( CL (the escape of N) ) )) & ( rng (the entrance of N) ) = ( rng (the escape of N) ))
proof
( (the entrance of N) * ( (the entrance of N) \ ( id (the carrier of N) ) ) ) = ( {} ) by CKB5:def 1;
then A1: ( (the entrance of N) * ( (the entrance of N) \ ( id ( dom (the entrance of N) ) ) ) ) = ( {} ) by CKB25:1;
( (the escape of N) * ( (the escape of N) \ ( id (the carrier of N) ) ) ) = ( {} ) by CKB5:def 1;
then A2: ( (the escape of N) * ( (the escape of N) \ ( id ( dom (the escape of N) ) ) ) ) = ( {} ) by CKB25:1;
A3: ( (the escape of N) * (the escape of N) ) = (the escape of N) by CKB2:def 1;
then A4: ( rng (the escape of N) ) = ( rng ( CL (the escape of N) ) ) by A2,SYSREL:31;
A5: ( (the entrance of N) * (the entrance of N) ) = (the entrance of N) by CKB2:def 1;
then ( rng (the entrance of N) ) = ( rng ( CL (the entrance of N) ) ) by A1,SYSREL:31;
hence thesis by A5,A1,A3,A2,A4,CKB26:1,SYSREL:31;
