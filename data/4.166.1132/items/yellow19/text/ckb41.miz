theorem
Lm1: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (T is  compact implies (for N being (net of T) holds (ex x being (Point of T) st x is_a_cluster_point_of N))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
assume that
A1: T is  compact;
let N being (net of T);
set F = { ( Cl A ) where A is (Subset of T,N): (not contradiction) };
F c= ( bool (the carrier of T) )
proof
let x;
assume x in F;
then (ex A being (Subset of T,N) st x = ( Cl A ));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider F as (Subset-Family of T);
set x = the (Element of ( meet F ));
A2: F is  centered
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(ex A being (Subset of T,N) st (ex i being (Element of N) st (($1 = ( Cl A ) & $2 = i) & A = ( rng (the mapping of ( N | i )) ))));
set A0 = the (Subset of T,N);
( Cl A0 ) in F;
hence F <> ( {} );
let G being set;
assume that
A3: G <> ( {} )
and
A4: G c= F
and
A5: G is  finite;
A6:now
let x;
assume x in G;
then x in F by A4;
then consider A being (Subset of T,N) such that A7: x = ( Cl A );
consider i being (Element of N) such that A8: A = ( rng (the mapping of ( N | i )) ) by CKB8:def 1;
reconsider y = i as set;
take y;
thus y in (the carrier of N);
thus P[ x,y ] by A7,A8;
end;
consider f being Function such that A9: (( dom f ) = G & ( rng f ) c= (the carrier of N)) and A10: (for x holds (x in G implies P[ x,( f . x ) ])) from FUNCT_1:sch 5(A6);
reconsider B = ( rng f ) as  finite (Subset of N) by A5,A9,FINSET_1:8;
( [#] N ) is  directed by WAYBEL_0:def 6;
then consider j being (Element of N) such that j in ( [#] N ) and A11: j is_>=_than B by WAYBEL_0:1;
now
let X;
assume A12: X in G;
then consider A being (Subset of T,N),i being (Element of N) such that A13: X = ( Cl A ) and A14: ( f . X ) = i and A15: A = ( rng (the mapping of ( N | i )) ) by A10;
A16: A c= X by A13,PRE_TOPC:18;
A17: (the mapping of ( N | i )) = ( (the mapping of N) | (the carrier of ( N | i )) ) by WAYBEL_9:def 7;
i in B by A9,A12,A14,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then i <= j by A11,LATTICE3:def 9;
then j in (the carrier of ( N | i )) by WAYBEL_9:def 7;
then A18: j in ( dom (the mapping of ( N | i )) ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( (the mapping of ( N | i )) . j ) in A by A15,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then ( N . j ) in A by A18,A17,FUNCT_1:47;
hence ( N . j ) in X by A16;
end;
hence thesis by A3,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
F is  closed
proof
let S being (Subset of T);
assume S in F;
then (ex A being (Subset of T,N) st S = ( Cl A ));
hence thesis;
end;
then A19: ( meet F ) <> ( {} ) by A1,A2,COMPTS_1:4;
then x in ( meet F );
then reconsider x as (Point of T);
take x;
now
let A being (Subset of T,N);
( Cl A ) in F;
hence x in ( Cl A ) by A19,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB39:1;
