theorem
Th12: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (for N being (net of T) holds (for x being (Point of T) holds (x is_a_cluster_point_of N iff x is_a_cluster_point_of ( a_filter N ),T))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
let N being (net of T);
set F = ( a_filter N );
let x being (Point of T);
thus (x is_a_cluster_point_of N implies x is_a_cluster_point_of F,T)
proof
assume A1: (for O being (a_neighborhood of x) holds N is_often_in O);
let A being (Subset of T);
assume that
A2: A is  open
and
A3: x in A;
let B being set;
assume B in F;
then N is_eventually_in B by CKB15:1;
then consider i being (Element of N) such that A4: (for j being (Element of N) holds (i <= j implies ( N . j ) in B)) by WAYBEL_0:def 11;
A is (a_neighborhood of x) by A2,A3,CONNSP_2:3;
then N is_often_in A by A1;
then (ex j being (Element of N) st (i <= j & ( N . j ) in A)) by WAYBEL_0:def 12;
then (ex a being (Point of T) st (a in B & a in A)) by A4;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:3;
end;

assume A5: (for A being (Subset of T) holds ((A is  open & x in A) implies (for B being set holds (B in F implies A meets B))));
let O being (a_neighborhood of x);
let i being (Element of N);
reconsider B = ( rng (the mapping of ( N | i )) ) as (Subset of T,N) by CKB8:def 1;
N is_eventually_in B by CKB12:1;
then A6: B in F;
x in ( Int O ) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
then ( Int O ) meets B by A5,A6;
then consider x being set such that A7: x in ( Int O ) and A8: x in B by XBOOLE_0:3;
consider j being (Element of N) such that A9: i <= j and A10: x = ( N . j ) by A8,CKB11:1;
take j;
( Int O ) c= O by TOPS_1:16;
hence thesis by A7,A9,A10;
