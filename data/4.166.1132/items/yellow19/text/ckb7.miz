theorem
(for T being non empty TopSpace holds (for A being (Subset of T) holds (A is  open iff (for x being (Point of T) holds (x in A implies (for F being (Filter of ( BoolePoset ( [#] T ) )) holds (x is_a_convergence_point_of F,T implies A in F)))))))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
let A being (Subset of T);
thus (A is  open implies (for x being (Point of T) holds (x in A implies (for F being (Filter of ( BoolePoset ( [#] T ) )) holds (x is_a_convergence_point_of F,T implies A in F))))) by WAYBEL_7:def 5;
assume A1: (for x being (Point of T) holds (x in A implies (for F being (Filter of ( BoolePoset ( [#] T ) )) holds (x is_a_convergence_point_of F,T implies A in F))));
set x = the (Element of ( A \ ( Int A ) ));
A2: ( Int A ) c= A by TOPS_1:16;
assume (not A is  open);
then (not A c= ( Int A )) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then A3: ( A \ ( Int A ) ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_1:37;
then x in ( A \ ( Int A ) );
then reconsider x as (Point of T);
A4: x in A by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
x is_a_convergence_point_of ( NeighborhoodSystem x ),T by CKB5:1;
then A in ( NeighborhoodSystem x ) by A1,A4;
then A is (a_neighborhood of x) by CKB3:1;
then x in ( Int A ) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
hence thesis by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
