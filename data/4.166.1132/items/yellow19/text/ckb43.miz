theorem
Th33: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (T is  compact iff (for F being  ultra (Filter of ( BoolePoset ( [#] T ) )) holds (ex x being (Point of T) st x is_a_convergence_point_of F,T))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
set X = (the carrier of T);
hereby
assume A1: T is  compact;
let F being  ultra (Filter of ( BoolePoset ( [#] T ) ));
set G = { ( Cl A ) where A is (Subset of T): A in F };
G c= ( bool (the carrier of T) )
proof
let x;
assume x in G;
then (ex A being (Subset of T) st (x = ( Cl A ) & A in F));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider G as (Subset-Family of T);
A2: G is  centered
proof
set A0 = the (Element of F);
reconsider A0 as (Subset of T) by WAYBEL_7:2;
( Cl A0 ) in G;
hence G <> ( {} );
let H being set;
assume that
A3: H <> ( {} )
and
A4: H c= G
and
A5: H is  finite;
reconsider H1 = H as  finite (Subset-Family of X) by A4,A5,XBOOLE_1:1;
H1 c= F
proof
let x;
assume x in H1;
then x in G by A4;
then consider A being (Subset of T) such that A6: x = ( Cl A ) and A7: A in F;
A c= ( Cl A ) by PRE_TOPC:18;
hence thesis by A6,A7,WAYBEL_7:7;
end;
then ( Intersect H1 ) in F by WAYBEL_7:11;
then ( Intersect H1 ) <> ( {} ) by CKB1:1;
hence thesis by A3,SETFAM_1:def 9;
end;
set x = the (Element of ( meet G ));
G is  closed
proof
let A being (Subset of T);
assume A in G;
then (ex B being (Subset of T) st (A = ( Cl B ) & B in F));
hence thesis;
end;
then A8: ( meet G ) <> ( {} ) by A1,A2,COMPTS_1:4;
then x in ( meet G );
then reconsider x as (Point of T);
take x;
thus x is_a_convergence_point_of F,T
proof
let A being (Subset of T);
assume that
A9: A is  open
and
A10: x in A;
set B = ( A ` );
A11:now
assume B in F;
then ( Cl B ) in G;
then A12: B in G by A9,PRE_TOPC:22;
(not x in B) by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence contradiction by A8,A12,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
F is  prime by WAYBEL_7:22;

reconsider Y = F as (Subset of ( BoolePoset X )) by WAYBEL_7:2;
set G = ( uparrow ( fininfs Y ) );
now
assume ( Bottom L ) in G;
then consider x being (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) such that A15: x <= ( Bottom L ) and A16: x in ( fininfs Y ) by WAYBEL_0:def 16;
A17: ( Bottom L ) = ( {} ) by YELLOW_1:18;
consider Z being  finite (Subset of Y) such that A18: x = ( "/\" (Z,L) ) and  ex_inf_of Z,L by A16;
reconsider Z as (Subset of L) by XBOOLE_1:1;
A19: x = ( Bottom L ) by A15,YELLOW_5:19;
then x <> ( Top L ) by WAYBEL_7:3;
then A20: Z <> ( {} ) by A18,YELLOW_0:def 12;
then ( meet Z ) <> ( {} ) by A14,FINSET_1:def 3;
hence contradiction by A17,A18,A19,A20,YELLOW_1:20;
end;
then G is  proper by WAYBEL_7:4;
then consider UF being (Filter of L) such that A21: G c= UF and A22: UF is  ultra by WAYBEL_7:26;
consider x being (Point of T) such that A23: x is_a_convergence_point_of UF,T by A13,A22;
F c= G by WAYBEL_0:62;
then A24: F c= UF by A21,XBOOLE_1:1;
A25:now
let A being set;
assume A26: A in F;
then reconsider B = A as (Subset of T);
A27:now
let C being (Subset of T);
assume that
A28: C is  open
and
A29: x in C;
A30: C in UF by A23,A28,A29,WAYBEL_7:def 5;
A in UF by A24,A26;
then reconsider c = C,a = A as (Element of L) by A30;
( a "/\" c ) in UF by A24,A26,A30,WAYBEL_0:41;
then ( a "/\" c ) <> ( {} ) by A22,CKB1:1;
then ( A /\ C ) <> ( {} ) by YELLOW_1:17;
hence A meets C by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
end;
B is  closed by A14,A26,TOPS_2:def 2;
then ( Cl B ) = B by PRE_TOPC:22;
hence x in A by A27,PRE_TOPC:24;
end;
F <> ( {} ) by A14,FINSET_1:def 3;
hence ( meet F ) <> ( {} ) by A25,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by COMPTS_1:4;
