theorem
(for S being non  empty 1-sorted holds (for N being (net of S) holds (for F being  finite non  empty set holds ((for A being (Element of F) holds A is (Subset of S,N)) implies (ex B being (Subset of S,N) st B c= ( meet F ))))))
proof
let S being non  empty 1-sorted;
let N being (net of S);
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(ex i being (Element of N) st ($2 = i & $1 = ( rng (the mapping of ( N | i )) )));
let F being  finite non  empty set;
assume that
A1: (for A being (Element of F) holds A is (Subset of S,N));
A2:now
let x;
assume x in F;
then reconsider A = x as (Subset of S,N) by A1;
consider i being (Element of N) such that A3: A = ( rng (the mapping of ( N | i )) ) by CKB8:def 1;
reconsider y = i as set;
take y;
thus y in (the carrier of N);
thus P[ x,y ] by A3;
end;
consider f being Function such that A4: (( dom f ) = F & ( rng f ) c= (the carrier of N)) and A5: (for x holds (x in F implies P[ x,( f . x ) ])) from FUNCT_1:sch 5(A2);
reconsider B = ( rng f ) as  finite (Subset of N) by A4,FINSET_1:8;
( [#] N ) is  directed by WAYBEL_0:def 6;
then consider j being (Element of N) such that j in ( [#] N ) and A6: j is_>=_than B by WAYBEL_0:1;
reconsider C = ( rng (the mapping of ( N | j )) ) as (Subset of S,N) by CKB8:def 1;
take C;
let x;
A7: (the carrier of ( N | j )) = { k where k is (Element of N): j <= k } by WAYBEL_9:12;
assume x in C;
then consider y such that A8: y in ( dom (the mapping of ( N | j )) ) and A9: x = ( (the mapping of ( N | j )) . y ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
A10: y in (the carrier of ( N | j )) by A8;
reconsider y as (Element of ( N | j )) by A8;
consider k being (Element of N) such that A11: y = k and A12: j <= k by A10,A7;
now
let X;
assume A13: X in F;
then consider i being (Element of N) such that A14: ( f . X ) = i and A15: X = ( rng (the mapping of ( N | i )) ) by A5;
i in B by A4,A13,A14,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then i <= j by A6,LATTICE3:def 9;
then i <= k by A12,ORDERS_2:3;
then y in { l where l is (Element of N): i <= l } by A11;
then reconsider z = y as (Element of ( N | i )) by WAYBEL_9:12;
x = ( ( N | j ) . y ) by A9
.= ( N . k ) by A11,WAYBEL_9:16
.= ( ( N | i ) . z ) by A11,WAYBEL_9:16
.= ( (the mapping of ( N | i )) . z );
hence x in X by A15,FUNCT_2:4;

hence thesis by SETFAM_1:def 1;
