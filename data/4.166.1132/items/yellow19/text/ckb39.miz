theorem
Th31: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (for N being (net of T) holds (for s being (Point of T) holds (s is_a_cluster_point_of N iff (for A being (Subset of T,N) holds s in ( Cl A ))))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
let N being (net of T);
let s being (Point of T);
hereby
assume A1: s is_a_cluster_point_of N;
let A being (Subset of T,N);
N is_eventually_in A by CKB12:1;
hence s in ( Cl A ) by A1,CKB31:1;
end;
assume A2: (for A being (Subset of T,N) holds s in ( Cl A ));
let V being (a_neighborhood of s);
let i being (Element of N);
reconsider A = ( rng (the mapping of ( N | i )) ) as (Subset of T,N) by CKB8:def 1;
set x = the (Element of ( A /\ ( Int V ) ));
A3: s in ( Int V ) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
s in ( Cl A ) by A2;
then A meets ( Int V ) by A3,PRE_TOPC:def 7;
then A4: ( A /\ ( Int V ) ) <> ( {} T ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A5: x in ( Int V ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A6: ( Int V ) c= V by TOPS_1:16;
x in A by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider j being set such that A7: j in ( dom (the mapping of ( N | i )) ) and A8: x = ( (the mapping of ( N | i )) . j ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
A9: (the carrier of ( N | i )) = { l where l is (Element of N): i <= l } by WAYBEL_9:12;
reconsider j as (Element of ( N | i )) by A7;
( dom (the mapping of ( N | i )) ) = (the carrier of ( N | i )) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then consider l being (Element of N) such that A10: j = l and A11: i <= l by A7,A9;
take l;
thus i <= l by A11;
x = ( ( N | i ) . j ) by A8
.= ( N . l ) by A10,WAYBEL_9:16;
hence thesis by A5,A6;
end;
