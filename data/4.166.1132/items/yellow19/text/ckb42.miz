theorem
Lm2: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds ((for N being (net of T) holds (N in ( NetUniv T ) implies (ex x being (Point of T) st x is_a_cluster_point_of N))) implies T is  compact))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
assume A1: (for N being (net of T) holds (N in ( NetUniv T ) implies (ex x being (Point of T) st x is_a_cluster_point_of N)));

A10: F c= G by CANTOR_1:4;

R is  directed
proof
let x being (Element of R);
let y being (Element of R);
assume that
x in ( [#] R )
and
y in ( [#] R );
A14: ( ~ x ) = x by LATTICE3:def 7;

set z = ( Intersect ( X \/ Y ) );
( X \/ Y ) c= F by A18,A15,XBOOLE_1:8;

A21: ( ~ z ) = z by LATTICE3:def 7;
take z;
thus z in ( [#] R );
A22: ( ~ y ) = y by LATTICE3:def 7;
z c= y by A17,SETFAM_1:44,XBOOLE_1:7;
then A23: ( ~ z ) <= ( ~ y ) by A22,A21,YELLOW_1:3;
z c= x by A20,SETFAM_1:44,XBOOLE_1:7;
then ( ~ z ) <= ( ~ x ) by A14,A21,YELLOW_1:3;

then N is_often_in V by A26,WAYBEL_9:def 9;

A35: ( ~ b9 ) = b by LATTICE3:def 7;
( ~ a9 ) = A by LATTICE3:def 7;
then A36: b c= A by A34,A35,YELLOW_1:3;
( N . b ) in b by A9,A12,A27,A35;
hence A meets V by A33,A36,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
A is  closed by A3,A28,TOPS_2:def 2;
then ( Cl A ) = A by PRE_TOPC:22;
