proof
set Y = ( NeighborhoodSystem x );
set X = (the carrier of T);
set L = ( BoolePoset ( [#] T ) );
set A0 = the (a_neighborhood of x);
A0 in ( NeighborhoodSystem x );
hence ( NeighborhoodSystem x ) is non  empty;
( {} ) c= X by XBOOLE_1:2;
then A1: ( {} ) in ( bool X );
(not ( {} ) is (a_neighborhood of x)) by CONNSP_2:4;
then A2: (not ( {} ) in ( NeighborhoodSystem x )) by CKB3:1;
(the carrier of ( BoolePoset X )) = ( bool X ) by WAYBEL_7:2;
hence ( NeighborhoodSystem x ) is  proper by A1,A2,SUBSET_1:def 6;
thus ( NeighborhoodSystem x ) is  upper
proof
let a being (Element of L);
let b being (Element of L);
reconsider B = b as (Subset of T) by WAYBEL_7:2;
assume a in Y;
then reconsider A = a as (a_neighborhood of x) by CKB3:1;
assume a <= b;
then A c= B by YELLOW_1:2;
then A3: ( Int A ) c= ( Int B ) by TOPS_1:19;
x in ( Int A ) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
then b is (a_neighborhood of x) by A3,CONNSP_2:def 1;
hence thesis;
