theorem
Th14: (for T being non empty 1-sorted holds (for F being (Filter of ( BoolePoset ( [#] T ) )) holds ( F \ { ( {} ) } ) = ( a_filter ( a_net F ) )))
proof
let T being non empty 1-sorted;
let F being (Filter of ( BoolePoset ( [#] T ) ));
set X = ( a_filter ( a_net F ) );
A1: (the carrier of ( a_net F )) = { [ a,f ] where a is (Element of T),f is (Element of F): a in f } by CKB20:def 1;
A2: ( BoolePoset ( [#] T ) ) = ( InclPoset ( bool ( [#] T ) ) ) by YELLOW_1:4;
thus ( F \ { ( {} ) } ) c= X
proof
let x;
assume A3: x in ( F \ { ( {} ) } );
then reconsider A = x as (Subset of T) by A2,YELLOW_1:1;
set a = the (Element of A);
(not x in { ( {} ) }) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then A4: A <> ( {} ) by TARSKI:def 1;
then a in A;
then reconsider a as (Element of T);
x in F by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then [ a,A ] in (the carrier of ( a_net F )) by A1,A4;
then reconsider i = [ a,A ] as (Element of ( a_net F ));
( a_net F ) is_eventually_in A
proof
take i;
let j being (Element of ( a_net F ));
A5: ( i `2 ) = A by MCART_1:7;
A6: ( ( a_net F ) . j ) = ( j `1 ) by CKB20:def 1;
assume i <= j;
then A7: ( j `2 ) c= ( i `2 ) by CKB20:def 1;
j in (the carrier of ( a_net F ));
then consider a being (Element of T),f being (Element of F) such that A8: j = [ a,f ] and A9: a in f by A1;
A10: ( j `1 ) = a by A8,MCART_1:7;
( j `2 ) = f by A8,MCART_1:7;
hence thesis by A9,A7,A6,A5,A10;

A15: (the carrier of ( BoolePoset ( [#] T ) )) = ( bool ( [#] T ) ) by A2,YELLOW_1:1;
A16: f c= x
proof
let x;

then reconsider b = x as (Element of T) by A15;

then reconsider j = [ b,f ] as (Element of ( a_net F ));

then A19: ( ( a_net F ) . j ) = b by CKB20:def 1;
( i `2 ) = f by A13,MCART_1:7;
then i <= j by A18,CKB20:def 1;
hence thesis by A12,A19;
