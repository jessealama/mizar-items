theorem
Th8: (for S being non empty 1-sorted holds (for N being (net of S) holds (for i being (Element of N) holds (for x being set holds (x in ( rng (the mapping of ( N | i )) ) iff (ex j being (Element of N) st (i <= j & x = ( N . j ))))))))
proof
let S being non empty 1-sorted;
let N being (net of S);
let i being (Element of N);
let x being set;
A1: ( dom (the mapping of ( N | i )) ) = (the carrier of ( N | i )) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hereby
assume x in ( rng (the mapping of ( N | i )) );
then consider y being set such that A2: y in (the carrier of ( N | i )) and A3: x = ( (the mapping of ( N | i )) . y ) by A1,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider y as (Element of ( N | i )) by A2;
consider j being (Element of N) such that A4: j = y and A5: i <= j by WAYBEL_9:def 7;
take j;
thus i <= j by A5;
thus x = ( ( N | i ) . y ) by A3
.= ( N . j ) by A4,WAYBEL_9:16;
end;
given j being (Element of N) such that
A6: i <= j
and
A7: x = ( N . j );

reconsider k = j as (Element of ( N | i )) by A6,WAYBEL_9:def 7;
A8: x = ( ( N | i ) . k ) by A7,WAYBEL_9:16
.= ( (the mapping of ( N | i )) . j );
j in (the carrier of ( N | i )) by A6,WAYBEL_9:def 7;
hence thesis by A1,A8,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;
