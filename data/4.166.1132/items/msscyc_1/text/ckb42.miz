theorem
Th22: (for S being non void non empty ManySortedSign holds (for A being  non-empty MSAlgebra over S holds (for X being  non-empty (GeneratorSet of A) holds (ex F being (ManySortedFunction of ( FreeMSA X ),A) st F is_epimorphism ( FreeMSA X ),A))))
proof
let S being non void non empty ManySortedSign;
let A being  non-empty MSAlgebra over S;
let X being  non-empty (GeneratorSet of A);
reconsider X9 = X as (MSSubset of A);
now
let i being set;
assume that
A1: i in (the carrier of S);
A2: ( ( Reverse X ) . i ) is (Function of ( ( FreeGen X ) . i ),( X . i )) by A1,PBOOLE:def 15;
X c= (the Sorts of A) by PBOOLE:def 18;
then ( X . i ) c= ( (the Sorts of A) . i ) by A1,PBOOLE:def 2;
hence ( ( Reverse X ) . i ) is (Function of ( ( FreeGen X ) . i ),( (the Sorts of A) . i )) by A1,A2,FUNCT_2:7;
end;
then reconsider ff = ( Reverse X ) as (ManySortedFunction of ( FreeGen X ),(the Sorts of A)) by PBOOLE:def 15;
( FreeGen X ) is  free by MSAFREE:16;
then consider h being (ManySortedFunction of ( FreeMSA X ),A) such that A3: h is_homomorphism ( FreeMSA X ),A and A4: ( h || ( FreeGen X ) ) = ff by MSAFREE:def 5;
take h;
thus h is_homomorphism ( FreeMSA X ),A by A3;
let i being set;
assume i in (the carrier of S);
then reconsider s = i as (SortSymbol of S);
set f = ( h . s );
consider g being (ManySortedFunction of ( FreeMSA X ),( Image h )) such that A5: h = g and A6: g is_epimorphism ( FreeMSA X ),( Image h ) by A3,MSUALG_3:21;
A7: g is_homomorphism ( FreeMSA X ),( Image h ) by A6,MSUALG_3:def 8;
then A8: ( Image g ) = ( Image h ) by A6,MSUALG_3:19;
X is (MSSubset of ( Image h ))
proof
let i being set;
assume A9: i in (the carrier of S);
then reconsider s = i as (SortSymbol of S);
s in ( dom ( Reverse X ) ) by A9,PARTFUN1:def 2;
then A10: (( rngs ( Reverse X ) ) = X & ( ( rngs ( Reverse X ) ) . s ) = ( rng ( ( Reverse X ) . s ) )) by EXTENS_1:10,FUNCT_6:22;
reconsider hs = ( h . s ) as (Function of ( (the Sorts of ( FreeMSA X )) . s ),( (the Sorts of A) . s ));
let x being set;
( FreeGen X ) c= (the Sorts of ( FreeMSA X )) by PBOOLE:def 18;
then A11: ( ( FreeGen X ) . s ) c= ( (the Sorts of ( FreeMSA X )) . s ) by PBOOLE:def 2;
(the Sorts of ( Image h )) = ( h .:.: (the Sorts of ( FreeMSA X )) ) by A3,MSUALG_3:def 12;
then A12: ( (the Sorts of ( Image h )) . s ) = ( hs .: ( (the Sorts of ( FreeMSA X )) . s ) ) by PBOOLE:def 20;
assume x in ( X . i );
then consider c being set such that A13: c in ( dom ( ff . s ) ) and A14: x = ( ( ff . s ) . c ) by A10,FUNCT_1:def 3;
A15: ( ff . s ) = ( hs | ( ( FreeGen X ) . s ) ) by A4,MSAFREE:def 1;
then ( dom ( ff . s ) ) = ( ( dom hs ) /\ ( ( FreeGen X ) . s ) ) by RELAT_1:61;
then A16: (c in ( ( FreeGen X ) . s ) & c in ( dom hs )) by A13,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
x = ( hs . c ) by A15,A13,A14,FUNCT_1:47;
hence thesis by A12,A11,A16,FUNCT_1:def 6;
end;
then ( GenMSAlg X9 ) is (MSSubAlgebra of ( Image h )) by MSUALG_2:def 17;
then (the Sorts of ( GenMSAlg X9 )) is (MSSubset of ( Image h )) by MSUALG_2:def 9;
then A17: (the Sorts of ( GenMSAlg X9 )) c= (the Sorts of ( Image h )) by PBOOLE:def 18;
(the Sorts of ( Image g )) = ( h .:.: (the Sorts of ( FreeMSA X )) ) by A5,A7,MSUALG_3:def 12;
then A18: ( (the Sorts of ( Image g )) . i ) = ( f .: ( (the Sorts of ( FreeMSA X )) . i ) ) by PBOOLE:def 20;
(the Sorts of ( Image h )) is (MSSubset of A) by MSUALG_2:def 9;
then ((the Sorts of ( GenMSAlg X9 )) = (the Sorts of A) & (the Sorts of ( Image h )) c= (the Sorts of A)) by MSAFREE:def 4,PBOOLE:def 18;
then (the Sorts of ( Image h )) = (the Sorts of A) by A17,PBOOLE:def 10;
hence thesis by A18,A8,FUNCT_2:37;
