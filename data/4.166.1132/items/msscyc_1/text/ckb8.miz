existence
proof
set V = { 1,2 };
set E = { 1 };
(1 in V & 2 in V) by TARSKI:def 2;
then reconsider S = ( E --> 1 ),T = ( E --> 2 ) as (Function of E,V) by FUNCOP_1:45;
reconsider G = MultiGraphStruct (# V,E,S,T #) as Graph;
take G;
thus G is  finite by GRAPH_1:def 9;
A1: 1 in E by TARSKI:def 1;
then A2: ( S . 1 ) = 1 by FUNCOP_1:7;
thus G is  simple
proof
given x being set such that

and
A4: ( (the Source of G) . x ) = ( (the Target of G) . x );

x = 1 by A3,TARSKI:def 1;
