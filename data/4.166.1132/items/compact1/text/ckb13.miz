cluster  locally-compact ->  liminally-compact for non empty  regular non empty  regular TopSpace;
coherence
proof
let X being non empty  regular TopSpace;
assume that
A1: X is  locally-compact;
let x being (Point of X);
set B = { Q where Q is (a_neighborhood of x): (Q is  compact & (ex V,W being (a_neighborhood of x) st Q c= ( V /\ W ))) };
B c= ( bool ( [#] X ) )
proof
let A being set;
assume A in B;
then (ex Q being (a_neighborhood of x) st ((A = Q & Q is  compact) & (ex V,W being (a_neighborhood of x) st Q c= ( V /\ W ))));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider B as (Subset-Family of X);
A2: B is (basis of x)
proof
let V being (a_neighborhood of x);
A3: x in ( Int V ) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
consider W being (a_neighborhood of x) such that A4: W is  compact by A1,CKB11:def 1;
x in ( Int W ) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
then x in ( ( Int V ) /\ ( Int W ) ) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then x in ( Int ( V /\ W ) ) by TOPS_1:17;
then consider Q being (Subset of X) such that A5: Q is  closed and A6: Q c= ( V /\ W ) and A7: x in ( Int Q ) by YELLOW_8:27;
reconsider Q as (a_neighborhood of x) by A7,CONNSP_2:def 1;
take Q;
( V /\ W ) c= W by XBOOLE_1:17;
then Q is  compact by A4,A5,A6,COMPTS_1:9,XBOOLE_1:1;
hence Q in B by A6;
( V /\ W ) c= V by XBOOLE_1:17;
hence thesis by A6,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
B is  compact
proof
let U being (Subset of X);
assume U in B;
then (ex Q being (a_neighborhood of x) st ((U = Q & Q is  compact) & (ex V,W being (a_neighborhood of x) st Q c= ( V /\ W ))));
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
