theorem
(for X being  Hausdorff non empty TopSpace holds (for E being non empty (Subset of X) holds (( X | E ) is  dense  locally-compact implies ( X | E ) is  open)))
proof
let X being  Hausdorff non empty TopSpace;
let E being non empty (Subset of X);
assume that
A1: ( X | E ) is  dense  locally-compact;
A2: ( [#] ( X | E ) ) = E by PRE_TOPC:8;
( Int E ) = E
proof
thus ( Int E ) c= E by TOPS_1:16;
let a being set;
assume A3: a in E;
then reconsider x = a as (Point of X);
reconsider xx = x as (Point of ( X | E )) by A3,PRE_TOPC:8;
set UE = { G where G is (Subset of X): (G is  open & G c= E) };
consider K being (a_neighborhood of xx) such that A4: K is  compact by A1,CKB11:def 1;
reconsider KK = K as (Subset of X) by A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
A5: K c= ( [#] ( X | E ) );
( Int K ) in (the topology of ( X | E )) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then consider G being (Subset of X) such that A6: G in (the topology of X) and A7: ( Int K ) = ( G /\ E ) by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
A8: G is  open by A6,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
(for P being (Subset of ( X | E )) holds (P = KK implies P is  compact)) by A4;
then KK is  compact by A5,COMPTS_1:2;
then A9: ( Cl ( G /\ E ) ) c= KK by A7,TOPS_1:5,TOPS_1:16;
E is  dense by A1,A2,TEX_3:def 1;
then A10: ( Cl ( G /\ E ) ) = ( Cl G ) by A8,TOPS_1:46;
G c= ( Cl G ) by PRE_TOPC:18;
then G c= K by A10,A9,XBOOLE_1:1;
then G c= E by A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
then A11: G in UE by A8;
A12: xx in ( Int K ) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
( Int K ) c= G by A7,XBOOLE_1:17;
then a in ( union UE ) by A12,A11,TARSKI:def 4;
hence thesis by TEX_4:3;
end;
hence thesis by A2,TSEP_1:16;
