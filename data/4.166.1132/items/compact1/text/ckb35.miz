theorem
(for X being non  empty TopSpace holds (X is  Hausdorff  locally-compact iff ( One-Point_Compactification X ) is  Hausdorff))
proof
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
set D = { ( U \/ { ( [#] X ) } ) where U is (Subset of X): (U is  open & ( U ` ) is  compact) };
A1: (not ( [#] X ) in ( [#] X ));
A2: ( [#] ( One-Point_Compactification X ) ) = ( succ ( [#] X ) ) by CKB29:def 1;
( [#] X ) in { ( [#] X ) } by TARSKI:def 1;
then reconsider q = ( [#] X ) as (Point of ( One-Point_Compactification X )) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
A3: (the topology of ( One-Point_Compactification X )) = ( (the topology of X) \/ D ) by CKB29:def 1;
A4: ( [#] X ) c= ( [#] ( One-Point_Compactification X ) ) by CKB31:1;
thus (X is  Hausdorff  locally-compact implies ( One-Point_Compactification X ) is  Hausdorff)
proof
assume that
A5: X is  Hausdorff
and
A6: X is  locally-compact;
let p being (Point of ( One-Point_Compactification X ));
let q being (Point of ( One-Point_Compactification X ));
assume that
A7: p <> q;
per cases  by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose (p in ( [#] X ) & q in ( [#] X ));

then consider W,V being (Subset of X) such that A8: W is  open and A9: V is  open and A10: p in W and A11: q in V and A12: W misses V by A5,A7,PRE_TOPC:def 10;
reconsider W,V as (Subset of ( One-Point_Compactification X )) by A4,XBOOLE_1:1;
