theorem
Th7: (for X being non  empty TopSpace holds (X is non  compact iff (ex X9 being (Subset of ( One-Point_Compactification X )) st (X9 = ( [#] X ) & X9 is  dense))))
proof
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
set D = { ( U \/ { ( [#] X ) } ) where U is (Subset of X): (U is  open & ( U ` ) is  compact) };
A1: (not ( [#] X ) in ( [#] X ));
A2: ( [#] ( One-Point_Compactification X ) ) = ( succ ( [#] X ) ) by CKB29:def 1;
A3: ( [#] X ) in { ( [#] X ) } by TARSKI:def 1;
then A4: ( [#] X ) in ( [#] ( One-Point_Compactification X ) ) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
A5: (the topology of ( One-Point_Compactification X )) = ( (the topology of X) \/ D ) by CKB29:def 1;
thus (X is non  compact implies (ex X9 being (Subset of ( One-Point_Compactification X )) st (X9 = ( [#] X ) & X9 is  dense)))
proof
assume X is non  compact;
then A6: ( [#] X ) is non  compact by COMPTS_1:1;
( [#] X ) c= ( [#] ( One-Point_Compactification X ) ) by CKB31:1;
then reconsider X9 = ( [#] X ) as (Subset of ( One-Point_Compactification X ));
take X9;
thus X9 = ( [#] X );
thus ( Cl X9 ) c= ( [#] ( One-Point_Compactification X ) );
A7: ( [#] X ) c= ( Cl X9 ) by PRE_TOPC:18;
A8:now
reconsider Xe = ( [#] X ) as (Element of ( One-Point_Compactification X )) by A3,A2,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
assume A9: (not ( [#] X ) in ( Cl X9 ));
reconsider XX = { Xe } as (Subset of ( One-Point_Compactification X ));
A10:now
assume XX in (the topology of X);
then ( [#] X ) in ( [#] X ) by A3;
hence contradiction;
end;
( ( [#] ( One-Point_Compactification X ) ) \ ( Cl X9 ) ) = ( ( ( [#] X ) \ ( Cl X9 ) ) \/ ( { ( [#] X ) } \ ( Cl X9 ) ) ) by A2,XBOOLE_1:42
.= ( ( {} ) \/ ( { ( [#] X ) } \ ( Cl X9 ) ) ) by A7,XBOOLE_1:37
.= XX by A9,ZFMISC_1:59;
then XX is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 3;
then XX in (the topology of ( One-Point_Compactification X )) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then XX in D by A5,A10,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then consider U being (Subset of X) such that A11: XX = ( U \/ { ( [#] X ) } ) and U is  open and A12: ( U ` ) is  compact;
now
assume U = XX;
then ( [#] X ) in ( [#] X ) by A3;
hence contradiction;
end;
then U = ( {} X ) by A11,ZFMISC_1:37;
hence contradiction by A6,A12;
end;
( [#] ( One-Point_Compactification X ) ) c= ( ( Cl X9 ) \/ { ( [#] X ) } ) by A2,PRE_TOPC:18,XBOOLE_1:9;
hence thesis by A8,ZFMISC_1:40;
end;

X1 is  open by A16,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
