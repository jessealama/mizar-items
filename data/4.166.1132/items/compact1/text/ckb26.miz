theorem
Th3: (for X,Y being TopSpace holds ((( [#] X ) c= ( [#] Y ) & (ex Xy being (Subset of Y) st (Xy = ( [#] X ) & (the topology of ( Y | Xy )) = (the topology of X)))) implies ( incl (X,Y) ) is  embedding))
proof
let X being TopSpace,Y being TopSpace;
assume that
A1: ( [#] X ) c= ( [#] Y );
A2: ( incl (X,Y) ) = ( id X ) by A1,YELLOW_9:def 1;
set YY = ( Y | ( rng ( incl (X,Y) ) ) );
A3: ( [#] YY ) = ( rng ( incl (X,Y) ) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
A4: (( [#] Y ) = ( {} ) implies ( [#] X ) = ( {} )) by A1;
then reconsider h = ( incl (X,Y) ) as (Function of X,YY) by A3,FUNCT_2:6;
set f = ( id X );
given Xy being (Subset of Y) such that
A5: Xy = ( [#] X )
and
A6: (the topology of ( Y | Xy )) = (the topology of X);

A7: (for P being (Subset of X) holds (P is  open implies ( ( h " ) " P ) is  open))
proof
let P being (Subset of X);
reconsider Q = P as (Subset of YY) by A2,A3,RELAT_1:45;
assume P is  open;
then A8: P in (the topology of X) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
( ( h " ) " P ) = ( h .: Q ) by A2,A3,TOPS_2:54
.= Q by A2,FUNCT_1:92;
hence ( ( h " ) " P ) in (the topology of YY) by A5,A6,A2,A8,RELAT_1:45;
end;
A9: (( [#] X ) = ( {} ) implies ( [#] X ) = ( {} ));
A10: (for P being (Subset of YY) holds (P is  open implies ( h " P ) is  open))
proof
let P being (Subset of YY);
reconsider Q = P as (Subset of X) by A2,A3,RELAT_1:45;
assume P is  open;
then P in (the topology of YY) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then Q in (the topology of X) by A5,A6,A2,RELAT_1:45;
then Q is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then ( f " Q ) is  open by A9,TOPS_2:43;
then ( f " Q ) in (the topology of X) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
hence ( h " P ) in (the topology of X) by A1,YELLOW_9:def 1;
end;
take h;
thus h = ( incl (X,Y) );
thus (( dom h ) = ( [#] X ) & ( rng h ) = ( [#] YY )) by A4,FUNCT_2:def 1,PRE_TOPC:def 5;
thus h is  one-to-one by A2;
(( [#] YY ) = ( {} ) implies ( [#] X ) = ( {} )) by A2,A3,RELAT_1:45;
hence h is  continuous by A10,TOPS_2:43;
(( [#] X ) = ( {} ) implies ( [#] YY ) = ( {} )) by A2,A3,RELAT_1:45;
hence thesis by A7,TOPS_2:43;
