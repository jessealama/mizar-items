definition
let X being non empty TopSpace;
redefine attr X is  liminally-compact
means
:Def3: (for x being (Point of X) holds (ex B being (basis of x) st B is  compact));
compatibility
proof
hereby
assume A1: X is  liminally-compact;
let x being (Point of X);
set B = { Q where Q is (a_neighborhood of x): (Q is  compact & (ex V being (a_neighborhood of x) st Q c= V)) };
B c= ( bool ( [#] X ) )
proof
let A being set;
assume A in B;
then (ex Q being (a_neighborhood of x) st ((A = Q & Q is  compact) & (ex V being (a_neighborhood of x) st Q c= V)));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider B as (Subset-Family of X);
A2: B is (basis of x)
proof
let V being (a_neighborhood of x);
x in ( Int V ) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
then consider Q being (Subset of X) such that A3: x in ( Int Q ) and A4: Q c= ( Int V ) and A5: Q is  compact by A1,WAYBEL_3:def 9;
reconsider Q as (a_neighborhood of x) by A3,CONNSP_2:def 1;
take Q;
( Int V ) c= V by TOPS_1:16;
hence thesis by A4,A5,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
B is  compact
proof
let U being (Subset of X);
assume U in B;
then (ex Q being (a_neighborhood of x) st ((U = Q & Q is  compact) & (ex V being (a_neighborhood of x) st Q c= V)));
hence thesis;
end;
hence (ex B being (basis of x) st B is  compact) by A2;
end;
assume A6: (for x being (Point of X) holds (ex B being (basis of x) st B is  compact));
let x being (Point of X);
let P being (Subset of X);
assume that
A7: x in P
and
A8: P is  open;
consider B being (basis of x) such that A9: B is  compact by A6;
x in ( Int P ) by A7,A8,TOPS_1:23;
then consider Q being (Subset of X) such that A10: Q in B and A11: x in ( Int Q ) and A12: Q c= P by YELLOW13:def 1;
take Q;
thus (x in ( Int Q ) & Q c= P) by A11,A12;
thus thesis by A9,A10,CKB1:def 1;
