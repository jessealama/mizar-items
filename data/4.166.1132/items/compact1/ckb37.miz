theorem
(for X being non empty TopSpace holds (X is non compact implies ( incl (X,( One-Point_Compactification X )) ) is  compactification))
proof
let X being non empty TopSpace;
set h = ( incl (X,( One-Point_Compactification X )) );
set D = { ( U \/ { ( [#] X ) } ) where U is (Subset of X): (U is  open & ( U ` ) is  compact) };
assume X is non compact;
then A1: (ex X9 being (Subset of ( One-Point_Compactification X )) st (X9 = ( [#] X ) & X9 is  dense)) by CKB36:1;
A2: ( [#] X ) c= ( [#] ( One-Point_Compactification X ) ) by CKB31:1;
then reconsider Xy = ( [#] X ) as (Subset of ( One-Point_Compactification X ));
A3: ( [#] ( ( One-Point_Compactification X ) | Xy ) ) = Xy by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
A4: (the topology of ( One-Point_Compactification X )) = ( (the topology of X) \/ D ) by CKB29:def 1;
(the topology of ( ( One-Point_Compactification X ) | Xy )) = (the topology of X)
proof
thus (the topology of ( ( One-Point_Compactification X ) | Xy )) c= (the topology of X)
proof
let x being set;
assume A5: x in (the topology of ( ( One-Point_Compactification X ) | Xy ));
then reconsider P = x as (Subset of ( ( One-Point_Compactification X ) | Xy ));
consider Q being (Subset of ( One-Point_Compactification X )) such that A6: Q in (the topology of ( One-Point_Compactification X )) and A7: P = ( Q /\ ( [#] ( ( One-Point_Compactification X ) | Xy ) ) ) by A5,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
per cases  by A4,A6,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose Q in (the topology of X);

hence thesis by A3,A7,XBOOLE_1:28;
end;
suppose Q in D;

then consider U being (Subset of X) such that A8: Q = ( U \/ { ( [#] X ) } ) and A9: U is  open and ( U ` ) is  compact;
(not ( [#] X ) in ( [#] X ));
then { ( [#] X ) } misses ( [#] X ) by ZFMISC_1:50;
then ( { ( [#] X ) } /\ ( [#] X ) ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then P = ( ( U /\ ( [#] X ) ) \/ ( {} ) ) by A3,A7,A8,XBOOLE_1:23
.= U by XBOOLE_1:28;
hence thesis by A9,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
end;
end;

let x being set;
assume A10: x in (the topology of X);
then reconsider P = x as (Subset of ( ( One-Point_Compactification X ) | Xy )) by A3;
reconsider Q = P as (Subset of ( One-Point_Compactification X )) by A3,XBOOLE_1:1;
A11: P = ( Q /\ ( [#] ( ( One-Point_Compactification X ) | Xy ) ) ) by XBOOLE_1:28;
Q in (the topology of ( One-Point_Compactification X )) by A4,A10,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence thesis by A11,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
end;
hence h is  embedding by A2,CKB26:1;
thus ( One-Point_Compactification X ) is  compact;
thus thesis by A2,A1,CKB24:1;
end;
