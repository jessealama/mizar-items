theorem
(for X0 being (maximal_Kolmogorov_subspace of X) holds (for G being (Subset of X) holds (G is  open iff (G = ( MaxADSet G ) & (ex G0 being (Subset of X0) st (G0 is  open & G0 = ( G /\ (the carrier of X0) )))))))
proof
let X0 being (maximal_Kolmogorov_subspace of X);
let G being (Subset of X);
reconsider M = (the carrier of X0) as (Subset of X) by Lm1;
thus (G is  open implies (G = ( MaxADSet G ) & (ex G0 being (Subset of X0) st (G0 is  open & G0 = ( G /\ (the carrier of X0) )))))
proof
reconsider G0 = ( G /\ M ) as (Subset of X0) by XBOOLE_1:17;
reconsider G0 as (Subset of X0);
assume A1: G is  open;
hence G = ( MaxADSet G ) by TEX_4:56;
take G0;
thus G0 is  open by A1,TSP_1:def 1;
thus thesis;

given G0 being (Subset of X0) such that
A3: G0 is  open
and
A4: G0 = ( G /\ (the carrier of X0) );

set E = G0;
E c= M;
then reconsider E as (Subset of X) by XBOOLE_1:1;
A5: E c= ( MaxADSet G ) by A2,A4,XBOOLE_1:17;
A6: M is  maximal_T_0 by CKB18:1;
(for x being set holds (x in G implies x in ( MaxADSet E )))
proof
let x being set;
assume A7: x in G;
then reconsider a = x as (Point of X);
consider b being (Point of X) such that A8: b in M and A9: ( M /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) = { b } by A6,CKB14:def 1;
A10: { b } c= ( MaxADSet a ) by A9,XBOOLE_1:17;
{ a } c= G by A7,ZFMISC_1:31;
