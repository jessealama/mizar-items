reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
reserve X0 for non  empty (maximal_Kolmogorov_subspace of X);
theorem
Lm6: (for r being  continuous (Function of X,X0) holds (r is  being_a_retraction implies (for E being (Subset of X) holds (for F being (Subset of X0) holds (F = E implies ( r " F ) = ( MaxADSet E ))))))
proof
let r being  continuous (Function of X,X0);
assume A1: r is  being_a_retraction;
reconsider A = (the carrier of X0) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
let E being (Subset of X);
let F being (Subset of X0);
set R = { ( MaxADSet a ) where a is (Point of X): a in E };
assume A2: F = E;
now
let x being set;
assume A3: x in ( r " F );
then reconsider b = x as (Point of X);
A4: ( r . b ) in F by A3,FUNCT_2:38;
then reconsider a = ( r . b ) as (Point of X) by A2;
( MaxADSet a ) in R by A2,A4;
then A5: ( MaxADSet a ) c= ( union R ) by ZFMISC_1:74;
( A /\ ( MaxADSet b ) ) = { a } by A1,CKB45:1;
then a in ( A /\ ( MaxADSet b ) ) by ZFMISC_1:31;
then a in ( MaxADSet b ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A6: ( MaxADSet a ) = ( MaxADSet b ) by TEX_4:21;
{ b } c= ( MaxADSet b ) by TEX_4:18;
then b in ( MaxADSet a ) by A6,ZFMISC_1:31;
hence x in ( union R ) by A5;
end;
then A7: ( r " F ) c= ( union R ) by TARSKI:def 3;
A is  maximal_T_0 by CKB18:1;
then A8: A is  T_0 by CKB4:def 1;
now
let C being set;
assume C in R;
then consider a being (Point of X) such that A9: C = ( MaxADSet a ) and A10: a in E;
now
let x being set;
assume A11: x in C;
then reconsider b = x as (Point of X) by A9;
A12: ( A /\ ( MaxADSet b ) ) = { ( r . b ) } by A1,CKB45:1;
A13: ( A /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) = { a } by A2,A8,A10,CKB2:def 1;
( MaxADSet a ) = ( MaxADSet b ) by A9,A11,TEX_4:21;
then a = ( r . x ) by A13,A12,ZFMISC_1:3;
hence x in ( r " F ) by A2,A9,A10,A11,FUNCT_2:38;
end;
hence C c= ( r " F ) by TARSKI:def 3;
end;
then A14: ( union R ) c= ( r " F ) by ZFMISC_1:76;
( MaxADSet E ) = ( union R ) by TEX_4:def 11;
hence thesis by A14,A7,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
