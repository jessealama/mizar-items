definition
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
let M being (Subset of X);
redefine attr M is  maximal_T_0
means
:Def5: (M is  T_0 & ( MaxADSet M ) = (the carrier of X));
compatibility
proof
thus (M is  maximal_T_0 implies (M is  T_0 & ( MaxADSet M ) = (the carrier of X)))
proof
assume A1: M is  maximal_T_0;
hence A2: M is  T_0 by CKB4:def 1;
(the carrier of X) c= ( MaxADSet M )
proof
assume (not (the carrier of X) c= ( MaxADSet M ));
then consider x being set such that A3: x in (the carrier of X) and A4: (not x in ( MaxADSet M )) by TARSKI:def 3;
reconsider x as (Point of X) by A3;
set A = ( M \/ { x } );
(for a being (Point of X) holds (a in A implies ( A /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) = { a }))
proof
let a being (Point of X);
assume a in A;
then A5: (a in M or a in { x }) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
now
per cases  by A5,TARSKI:def 1;
suppose A6: a in M;

( { x } /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) = ( {} )
proof
assume ( { x } /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) <> ( {} );
then { x } meets ( MaxADSet a ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A7: x in ( MaxADSet a ) by ZFMISC_1:50;
{ a } c= M by A6,ZFMISC_1:31;
then ( MaxADSet { a } ) c= ( MaxADSet M ) by TEX_4:31;
then ( MaxADSet a ) c= ( MaxADSet M ) by TEX_4:28;
hence contradiction by A4,A7;
end;
then ( A /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) = ( ( M /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) \/ ( {} ) ) by XBOOLE_1:23
.= ( M /\ ( MaxADSet a ) );
hence thesis by A2,A6,CKB2:def 1;

suppose A8: a = x;

then A9: { x } c= ( MaxADSet a ) by TEX_4:18;
( M /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) = ( {} )
proof
A10: M c= ( MaxADSet M ) by TEX_4:32;

then ( ( MaxADSet a ) /\ ( MaxADSet M ) ) <> ( {} ) by A10,XBOOLE_1:3,XBOOLE_1:26;
then ( MaxADSet a ) meets ( MaxADSet M ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A11: ( MaxADSet a ) c= ( MaxADSet M ) by TEX_4:30;
x in ( MaxADSet a ) by A9,ZFMISC_1:31;
hence contradiction by A4,A11;
end;
then ( A /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) = ( ( {} ) \/ ( { x } /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) ) by XBOOLE_1:23
.= ( { x } /\ ( MaxADSet a ) );
hence thesis by A8,TEX_4:18,XBOOLE_1:28;
end;

then A12: A is  T_0 by CKB2:def 1;
A13: M c= ( MaxADSet M ) by TEX_4:32;
A14: { x } c= A by XBOOLE_1:7;
M c= A by XBOOLE_1:7;
then M = A by A1,A12,CKB4:def 1;
then x in M by A14,ZFMISC_1:31;
hence contradiction by A4,A13;
end;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 10;

assume A15: M is  T_0;
assume A16: ( MaxADSet M ) = (the carrier of X);
(for D being (Subset of X) holds ((D is  T_0 & M c= D) implies M = D))
proof
let D being (Subset of X);
assume A17: D is  T_0;
assume A18: M c= D;
D c= M
proof
assume (not D c= M);
then consider x being set such that A19: x in D and A20: (not x in M) by TARSKI:def 3;
A21: x in (the carrier of X) by A19;
reconsider x as (Point of X) by A19;
