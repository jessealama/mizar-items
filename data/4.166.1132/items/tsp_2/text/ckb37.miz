theorem
(for X0 being (maximal_Kolmogorov_subspace of X) holds (for F being (Subset of X) holds (F is  closed iff (F = ( MaxADSet F ) & (ex F0 being (Subset of X0) st (F0 is  closed & F0 = ( F /\ (the carrier of X0) )))))))
proof
let X0 being (maximal_Kolmogorov_subspace of X);
reconsider M = (the carrier of X0) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
let F being (Subset of X);
thus (F is  closed implies (F = ( MaxADSet F ) & (ex F0 being (Subset of X0) st (F0 is  closed & F0 = ( F /\ (the carrier of X0) )))))
proof
set F0 = ( F /\ M );
reconsider F0 as (Subset of X0) by XBOOLE_1:17;
assume A1: F is  closed;
hence F = ( MaxADSet F ) by TEX_4:60;
take F0;
thus F0 is  closed by A1,TSP_1:def 2;
thus thesis;
end;

assume A2: F = ( MaxADSet F );
given F0 being (Subset of X0) such that
A3: F0 is  closed
and
A4: F0 = ( F /\ (the carrier of X0) );

set E = F0;
E c= M;
then reconsider E as (Subset of X) by XBOOLE_1:1;
A5: E c= ( MaxADSet F ) by A2,A4,XBOOLE_1:17;
A6: M is  maximal_T_0 by CKB18:1;
(for x being set holds (x in F implies x in ( MaxADSet E )))
proof
let x being set;
assume A7: x in F;
then reconsider a = x as (Point of X);
consider b being (Point of X) such that A8: b in M and A9: ( M /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) = { b } by A6,CKB14:def 1;
A10: { b } c= ( MaxADSet a ) by A9,XBOOLE_1:17;
{ a } c= F by A7,ZFMISC_1:31;
then ( MaxADSet { a } ) c= F by A2,TEX_4:34;
then ( MaxADSet a ) c= F by TEX_4:28;
then { b } c= F by A10,XBOOLE_1:1;
then b in F by ZFMISC_1:31;
then b in E by A4,A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then { b } c= E by ZFMISC_1:31;
then ( MaxADSet { b } ) c= ( MaxADSet E ) by TEX_4:31;
then A11: ( MaxADSet b ) c= ( MaxADSet E ) by TEX_4:28;
b in ( MaxADSet a ) by A10,ZFMISC_1:31;
then ( MaxADSet b ) = ( MaxADSet a ) by TEX_4:21;
then { a } c= ( MaxADSet b ) by TEX_4:18;
then a in ( MaxADSet b ) by ZFMISC_1:31;
hence thesis by A11;
end;
then A12: F c= ( MaxADSet E ) by TARSKI:def 3;
( MaxADSet E ) is  closed by A3,CKB36:1;
hence thesis by A2,A5,A12,TEX_4:35;
