definition
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
let A being (Subset of X);
redefine attr A is  T_0
means
(for a being (Point of X) holds (a in A implies (ex D being (Subset of X) st (D is  maximal_anti-discrete & ( A /\ D ) = { a }))));
compatibility
proof
thus (A is  T_0 implies (for a being (Point of X) holds (a in A implies (ex D being (Subset of X) st (D is  maximal_anti-discrete & ( A /\ D ) = { a })))))
proof
assume A1: A is  T_0;
let a being (Point of X);
assume A2: a in A;
take D = ( MaxADSet a );
thus D is  maximal_anti-discrete by TEX_4:20;
thus thesis by A1,A2,CKB2:def 1;
end;

assume A3: (for a being (Point of X) holds (a in A implies (ex D being (Subset of X) st (D is  maximal_anti-discrete & ( A /\ D ) = { a }))));
now
let a being (Point of X);
assume a in A;
then consider D being (Subset of X) such that A4: D is  maximal_anti-discrete and A5: ( A /\ D ) = { a } by A3;
a in ( A /\ D ) by A5,ZFMISC_1:31;
then a in D by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence ( A /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) = { a } by A4,A5,TEX_4:27;
end;
hence thesis by CKB2:def 1;
end;
