reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
definition
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
let X0 being non  empty (SubSpace of X);
redefine attr X0 is  maximal_T_0
means
(X0 is  T_0 & (for Y0 being  T_0 non  empty (SubSpace of X) holds (X0 is (SubSpace of Y0) implies ( the TopStruct of X0 ) = ( the TopStruct of Y0 ))));
compatibility
proof
reconsider A = (the carrier of X0) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
thus (X0 is  maximal_T_0 implies (X0 is  T_0 & (for Y0 being  T_0 non  empty (SubSpace of X) holds (X0 is (SubSpace of Y0) implies ( the TopStruct of X0 ) = ( the TopStruct of Y0 )))))
proof
assume X0 is  maximal_T_0;
then A1: A is  maximal_T_0 by CKB18:1;
then A is  T_0 by CKB4:def 1;
hence X0 is  T_0 by TSP_1:13;
thus (for Y0 being  T_0 non  empty (SubSpace of X) holds (X0 is (SubSpace of Y0) implies ( the TopStruct of X0 ) = ( the TopStruct of Y0 )))
proof
let Y0 being  T_0 non  empty (SubSpace of X);
reconsider D = (the carrier of Y0) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
assume X0 is (SubSpace of Y0);
then A2: A c= D by TSEP_1:4;
D is  T_0 by TSP_1:13;
then A = D by A1,A2,CKB4:def 1;
hence thesis by TSEP_1:5;
end;

end;

assume X0 is  T_0;
then A3: A is  T_0 by TSP_1:13;
assume A4: (for Y0 being  T_0 non  empty (SubSpace of X) holds (X0 is (SubSpace of Y0) implies ( the TopStruct of X0 ) = ( the TopStruct of Y0 )));
now
let D being (Subset of X);
assume A5: D is  T_0;
assume A6: A c= D;
then D <> ( {} );
then consider Y0 being  T_0  strict non  empty (SubSpace of X) such that A7: D = (the carrier of Y0) by A5,TSP_1:18;
X0 is (SubSpace of Y0) by A6,A7,TSEP_1:4;
hence A = D by A4,A7;
end;
then A is  maximal_T_0 by A3,CKB4:def 1;
hence thesis by CKB18:1;
