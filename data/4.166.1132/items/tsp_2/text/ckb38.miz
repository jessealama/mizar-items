reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
reserve X0 for non  empty (maximal_Kolmogorov_subspace of X);
theorem
Th18: (for r being (Function of X,X0) holds (for M being (Subset of X) holds (M = (the carrier of X0) implies ((for a being (Point of X) holds ( M /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) = { ( r . a ) }) implies r is  continuous  continuous (Function of X,X0)))))
proof
let r being (Function of X,X0);
let M being (Subset of X);
assume A1: M = (the carrier of X0);
reconsider N = M as (Subset of X);
assume A2: (for a being (Point of X) holds ( M /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) = { ( r . a ) });
A3: N is  maximal_T_0 by A1,CKB18:1;
then A4: N is  T_0 by CKB4:def 1;
(for F being (Subset of X0) holds (F is  closed implies ( r " F ) is  closed))
proof
let F being (Subset of X0);
reconsider E = F as (Subset of X) by A1,XBOOLE_1:1;
set R = { ( MaxADSet a ) where a is (Point of X): a in E };
now
let x being set;
assume A5: x in ( r " F );
then reconsider b = x as (Point of X);
A6: ( r . b ) in F by A5,FUNCT_2:38;
E c= (the carrier of X);
then reconsider a = ( r . b ) as (Point of X) by A6;
( MaxADSet a ) in R by A6;
then A7: ( MaxADSet a ) c= ( union R ) by ZFMISC_1:74;
( M /\ ( MaxADSet b ) ) = { a } by A2;
then a in ( M /\ ( MaxADSet b ) ) by ZFMISC_1:31;
then a in ( MaxADSet b ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A8: ( MaxADSet a ) = ( MaxADSet b ) by TEX_4:21;
A9: { b } c= ( MaxADSet b ) by TEX_4:18;
b in { b } by TARSKI:def 1;
then b in ( MaxADSet a ) by A8,A9;
hence x in ( union R ) by A7;
end;
then A10: ( r " F ) c= ( union R ) by TARSKI:def 3;
assume F is  closed;
then (ex P being (Subset of X) st (P is  closed & ( P /\ ( [#] X0 ) ) = F)) by PRE_TOPC:13;
then A11: ( MaxADSet E ) is  closed by A1,A3,CKB10:1;
now
let C being set;
assume C in R;
then consider a being (Point of X) such that A12: C = ( MaxADSet a ) and A13: a in E;
now
let x being set;
assume A14: x in C;
then reconsider b = x as (Point of X) by A12;
A15: ( M /\ ( MaxADSet b ) ) = { ( r . b ) } by A2;
A16: ( M /\ ( MaxADSet a ) ) = { a } by A1,A4,A13,CKB2:def 1;
( MaxADSet a ) = ( MaxADSet b ) by A12,A14,TEX_4:21;
then a = ( r . x ) by A16,A15,ZFMISC_1:3;
hence x in ( r " F ) by A12,A13,A14,FUNCT_2:38;
end;
hence C c= ( r " F ) by TARSKI:def 3;
end;
then A17: ( union R ) c= ( r " F ) by ZFMISC_1:76;
( union R ) = ( MaxADSet E ) by TEX_4:def 11;
hence thesis by A11,A17,A10,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
hence thesis by PRE_TOPC:def 6;
