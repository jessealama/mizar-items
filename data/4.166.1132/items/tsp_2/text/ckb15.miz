theorem
Th9: (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A is  T_0 implies (ex M being (Subset of X) st (A c= M & M is  maximal_T_0))))
proof
let A being (Subset of X);
set D = ( ( [#] X ) \ ( MaxADSet A ) );
set F = { ( MaxADSet d ) where d is (Point of X): d in D };
now
let C being set;
assume C in F;
then (ex a being (Point of X) st (C = ( MaxADSet a ) & a in D));
hence C in ( bool (the carrier of X) );
end;
then reconsider F as (Subset-Family of X) by TARSKI:def 3;
assume A1: A is  T_0;
defpred X[ (Subset of X),set ]
 means
($2 in D & $2 in $1);
A2: D = ( ( MaxADSet A ) ` );
then A3: ( MaxADSet A ) misses D by SUBSET_1:24;
A c= ( MaxADSet A ) by TEX_4:32;
then A misses D by A2,SUBSET_1:24;
then A4: ( A /\ D ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
reconsider F as (Subset-Family of X);
A5: (for S being (Subset of X) holds (S in F implies (ex x being (Point of X) st X[ S,x ])))
proof
let S being (Subset of X);
assume S in F;
then consider d being (Point of X) such that A6: S = ( MaxADSet d ) and A7: d in D;
take d;
{ d } c= ( MaxADSet d ) by TEX_4:18;
hence thesis by A6,A7,ZFMISC_1:31;

consider f being (Function of F,(the carrier of X)) such that A8: (for S being (Subset of X) holds (S in F implies X[ S,( f . S ) ])) from TEX_2:sch 1(A5);
set M = ( A \/ ( f .: F ) );
now
let x being set;
assume x in ( f .: F );
then (ex S being set st ((S in F & S in F) & x = ( f . S ))) by FUNCT_2:64;
hence x in D by A8;
end;
then ( f .: F ) c= D by TARSKI:def 3;
then A9: ( MaxADSet A ) misses ( f .: F ) by A3,XBOOLE_1:63;
thus (ex M being (Subset of X) st (A c= M & M is  maximal_T_0))
proof

consider a being (Point of X) such that A16: C = ( MaxADSet a ) and A17: a in A by A15;
