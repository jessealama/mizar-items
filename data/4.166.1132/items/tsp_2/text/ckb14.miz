begin
reserve X for non  empty TopSpace;
definition
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
let M being (Subset of X);
redefine attr M is  maximal_T_0
means
:Def6: (for x being (Point of X) holds (ex a being (Point of X) st (a in M & ( M /\ ( MaxADSet x ) ) = { a })));
compatibility
proof
thus (M is  maximal_T_0 implies (for x being (Point of X) holds (ex a being (Point of X) st (a in M & ( M /\ ( MaxADSet x ) ) = { a }))))
proof
assume A1: M is  maximal_T_0;
then A2: M is  T_0 by CKB4:def 1;
let x being (Point of X);
x in (the carrier of X);
then x in ( MaxADSet M ) by A1,CKB6:def 1;
then x in ( union { ( MaxADSet a ) where a is (Point of X): a in M } ) by TEX_4:def 11;
then consider C being set such that A3: x in C and A4: C in { ( MaxADSet a ) where a is (Point of X): a in M } by TARSKI:def 4;
consider a being (Point of X) such that A5: C = ( MaxADSet a ) and A6: a in M by A4;
( MaxADSet a ) = ( MaxADSet x ) by A3,A5,TEX_4:21;
then ( M /\ ( MaxADSet x ) ) = { a } by A2,A6,CKB2:def 1;
hence thesis by A6;
end;

assume A7: (for x being (Point of X) holds (ex a being (Point of X) st (a in M & ( M /\ ( MaxADSet x ) ) = { a })));
now
let x being set;
A8: M c= ( MaxADSet M ) by TEX_4:32;
assume x in (the carrier of X);
then reconsider y = x as (Point of X);
consider a being (Point of X) such that A9: a in M and A10: ( M /\ ( MaxADSet y ) ) = { a } by A7;
{ a } c= ( MaxADSet y ) by A10,XBOOLE_1:17;
then a in ( MaxADSet y ) by ZFMISC_1:31;
then ( ( MaxADSet y ) /\ ( MaxADSet M ) ) <> ( {} ) by A9,A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then ( MaxADSet y ) meets ( MaxADSet M ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A11: ( MaxADSet y ) c= ( MaxADSet M ) by TEX_4:30;
{ y } c= ( MaxADSet y ) by TEX_4:18;
then y in ( MaxADSet y ) by ZFMISC_1:31;
hence x in ( MaxADSet M ) by A11;
end;
then (the carrier of X) c= ( MaxADSet M ) by TARSKI:def 3;
then A12: ( MaxADSet M ) = (the carrier of X) by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
(for b being (Point of X) holds (b in M implies ( M /\ ( MaxADSet b ) ) = { b }))
proof
let b being (Point of X);
A13: (ex a being (Point of X) st (a in M & ( M /\ ( MaxADSet b ) ) = { a })) by A7;
{ b } c= ( MaxADSet b ) by TEX_4:18;
then A14: b in ( MaxADSet b ) by ZFMISC_1:31;
assume b in M;
then b in ( M /\ ( MaxADSet b ) ) by A14,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by A13,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
then M is  T_0 by CKB2:def 1;
hence thesis by A12,CKB6:def 1;
end;
