theorem
(for f being (PartFunc of ( REAL ),( REAL )) holds (for a,b being Real holds ((((a < b & [' a,b '] c= ( dom f )) & f is_integrable_on [' a,b ']) & ( f | [' a,b '] ) is  bounded) implies ( ext_left_integral (f,a,b) ) = ( integral (f,a,b) ))))
proof
let f being (PartFunc of ( REAL ),( REAL ));
let a being Real;
let b being Real;
assume that
A1: a < b
and
A2: [' a,b '] c= ( dom f )
and
A3: f is_integrable_on [' a,b ']
and
A4: ( f | [' a,b '] ) is  bounded;
reconsider AB = ]. a,b .] as non  empty (Subset of ( REAL )) by A1,XXREAL_1:2;
deffunc F((Element of AB)) = ( integral (f,$1,b) );
consider Intf being (Function of AB,( REAL )) such that A5: (for x being (Element of AB) holds ( Intf . x ) = F(x)) from FUNCT_2:sch 4;
A6: ( dom Intf ) = AB by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then reconsider Intf as (PartFunc of ( REAL ),( REAL )) by RELSET_1:5;
consider M0 being  real number such that A7: (for x being set holds (x in ( [' a,b '] /\ ( dom f ) ) implies ( abs ( f . x ) ) <= M0)) by A4,RFUNCT_1:73;
reconsider M = ( M0 + 1 ) as Real;
A8: (for x being Real holds (x in [' a,b '] implies ( abs ( f . x ) ) < M))
proof
A9: ( [' a,b '] /\ ( dom f ) ) = [' a,b '] by A2,XBOOLE_1:28;
let x being Real;
assume x in [' a,b '];
hence thesis by A7,A9,XREAL_1:39;

proof
let g1 being Real;
assume ( 0 ) < g1;
then consider r being Real such that A12: a < r and A13: r < b and A14: ( ( r - a ) * M ) < g1 by A1,A10,CKB2:1;

thus a < r by A12;

then A24: ( abs ( integral (f,a,r1) ) ) < ( M * ( r - a ) ) by A19,XXREAL_0:2;
( abs ( ( Intf . r1 ) - ( integral (f,a,b) ) ) ) = ( abs ( ( integral (f,a,b) ) - ( Intf . r1 ) ) ) by COMPLEX1:60

proof
let r;

A26: a < r;
per cases ;
suppose A27: b < r;

reconsider g = b as Real;
take g;
g in ]. a,b .] by A1,XXREAL_1:2;
hence thesis by A1,A27,FUNCT_2:def 1;
end;
suppose A28: (not b < r);

reconsider g = ( a + ( ( r - a ) / 2 ) ) as Real;
take g;
A29: ( 0 ) < ( r - a ) by A26,XREAL_1:50;
then A30: a < g by XREAL_1:29,XREAL_1:215;
( ( r - a ) / 2 ) < ( r - a ) by A29,XREAL_1:216;
then A31: ( ( ( r - a ) / 2 ) + a ) < ( ( r - a ) + a ) by XREAL_1:8;
then g < b by A28,XXREAL_0:2;
hence thesis by A6,A30,A31,XXREAL_1:2;
