theorem
(for f being (PartFunc of ( REAL ),( REAL )) holds (for a,b being Real holds ((((a < b & [' a,b '] c= ( dom f )) & f is_integrable_on [' a,b ']) & ( f | [' a,b '] ) is  bounded) implies ( ext_right_integral (f,a,b) ) = ( integral (f,a,b) ))))
proof
let f being (PartFunc of ( REAL ),( REAL ));
let a being Real,b being Real;
assume that
A1: a < b
and
A2: [' a,b '] c= ( dom f )
and
A3: f is_integrable_on [' a,b ']
and
A4: ( f | [' a,b '] ) is  bounded;
reconsider AB = [. a,b .[ as non empty (Subset of ( REAL )) by A1,XXREAL_1:3;
deffunc F((Element of AB)) = ( integral (f,a,$1) );
consider Intf being (Function of AB,( REAL )) such that A5: (for x being (Element of AB) holds ( Intf . x ) = F(x)) from FUNCT_2:sch 4;
A6: ( dom Intf ) = AB by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then reconsider Intf as (PartFunc of ( REAL ),( REAL )) by RELSET_1:5;
consider M0 being  real number such that A7: (for x being set holds (x in ( [' a,b '] /\ ( dom f ) ) implies ( abs ( f . x ) ) <= M0)) by A4,RFUNCT_1:73;
reconsider M = ( M0 + 1 ) as Real;
A8: (for x being Real holds (x in [' a,b '] implies ( abs ( f . x ) ) < M))
proof
A9: ( [' a,b '] /\ ( dom f ) ) = [' a,b '] by A2,XBOOLE_1:28;
let x being Real;
assume x in [' a,b '];
hence thesis by A7,A9,XREAL_1:39;
end;

proof
let g1 being Real;
assume ( 0 ) < g1;
then consider r being Real such that A12: a < r and A13: r < b and A14: ( ( b - r ) * M ) < g1 by A1,A10,CKB1:1;
take r;
thus r < b by A13;
now

A18: ( Intf . r1 ) = ( integral (f,a,r1) ) by A5,A6,A17;
A19: a <= r1 by A12,A15,XXREAL_0:2;
then r1 in [. a,b .] by A16,XXREAL_1:1;
then A20: r1 in [' a,b '] by A1,INTEGRA5:def 3;
( b - r1 ) < ( b - r ) by A15,XREAL_1:15;
then A21: ( M * ( b - r1 ) ) < ( M * ( b - r ) ) by A10,XREAL_1:68;
A22: [' a,b '] = [. a,b .] by A1,INTEGRA5:def 3;
[. r1,b .] = [' r1,b '] by A16,INTEGRA5:def 3;

then ( abs ( integral (f,r1,b) ) ) <= ( M * ( b - r1 ) ) by A1,A2,A3,A4,A16,A20,A23,INTEGRA6:23;
then A24: ( abs ( integral (f,r1,b) ) ) < ( M * ( b - r ) ) by A21,XXREAL_0:2;
( abs ( ( Intf . r1 ) - ( integral (f,a,b) ) ) ) = ( abs ( ( integral (f,a,b) ) - ( Intf . r1 ) ) ) by COMPLEX1:60
.= ( abs ( ( ( integral (f,a,r1) ) + ( integral (f,r1,b) ) ) - ( integral (f,a,r1) ) ) ) by A1,A2,A3,A4,A18,A20,INTEGRA6:17
.= ( abs ( integral (f,r1,b) ) );
hence ( abs ( ( Intf . r1 ) - ( integral (f,a,b) ) ) ) < g1 by A14,A24,XXREAL_0:2;

hence thesis;

proof
let r;
assume that
A26: r < b;
per cases ;
suppose A27: r < a;

reconsider g = a as Real;
take g;
thus thesis by A1,A6,A27,XXREAL_1:3;
end;
suppose (not r < a);

then A28: ( a - a ) <= ( r - a ) by XREAL_1:9;
reconsider g = ( r + ( ( b - r ) / 2 ) ) as Real;
take g;
A29: ( 0 ) < ( b - r ) by A26,XREAL_1:50;
then ( ( b - r ) / 2 ) < ( b - r ) by XREAL_1:216;
then A30: ( ( ( b - r ) / 2 ) + r ) < ( ( b - r ) + r ) by XREAL_1:8;
r < g by A29,XREAL_1:29,XREAL_1:215;
then A31: ( r - ( r - a ) ) < ( g - ( 0 ) ) by A28,XREAL_1:14;
( 0 ) < ( ( b - r ) / 2 ) by A29,XREAL_1:215;
hence thesis by A6,A31,A30,XREAL_1:8,XXREAL_1:3;
end;
end;
then A32: Intf is_left_convergent_in b by A11,LIMFUNC2:7;
then A33: ( integral (f,a,b) ) = ( lim_left (Intf,b) ) by A11,LIMFUNC2:41;
(for d being Real holds ((a <= d & d < b) implies (f is_integrable_on [' a,d '] & ( f | [' a,d '] ) is  bounded))) by A2,A3,A4,INTEGRA6:18;
then f is_right_ext_Riemann_integrable_on a,b by A6,A25,A32,CKB4:def 1;
hence thesis by A6,A25,A32,A33,CKB6:def 1;
