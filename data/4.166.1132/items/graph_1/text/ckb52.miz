theorem
(((the Source of G1) tolerates (the Source of G2) & (the Target of G1) tolerates (the Target of G2)) implies ((the Source of ( G1 \/ G2 )) = ( (the Source of G1) \/ (the Source of G2) ) & (the Target of ( G1 \/ G2 )) = ( (the Target of G1) \/ (the Target of G2) )))
proof
assume A1: ((the Source of G1) tolerates (the Source of G2) & (the Target of G1) tolerates (the Target of G2));

set T1 = (the Target of G1);
set T2 = (the Target of G2);
(for v holds (v in S12 iff v in ( S1 \/ S2 )))
proof
let v;
thus (v in S12 implies v in ( S1 \/ S2 ))
proof

then consider x being set,y being set such that A3: [ x,y ] = v by RELAT_1:def 1;
