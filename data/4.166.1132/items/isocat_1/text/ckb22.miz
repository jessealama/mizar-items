theorem
[: A,B :] ~= [: B,A :]
proof
take F = <: ( pr2 (A,B) ),( pr1 (A,B) ) :>;
A1: (( dom ( pr1 (A,B) ) ) = (the carrier' of [: A,B :]) & ( dom ( pr2 (A,B) ) ) = (the carrier' of [: A,B :])) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
now
let x1 being set;
let x2 being set;
assume x1 in [: (the carrier' of A),(the carrier' of B) :];
then consider x11,x12 being set such that A2: x11 in (the carrier' of A) and A3: x12 in (the carrier' of B) and A4: x1 = [ x11,x12 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
assume x2 in [: (the carrier' of A),(the carrier' of B) :];
then consider x21,x22 being set such that A5: x21 in (the carrier' of A) and A6: x22 in (the carrier' of B) and A7: x2 = [ x21,x22 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider f12 = x12,f22 = x22 as (Morphism of B) by A3,A6;
reconsider f11 = x11,f21 = x21 as (Morphism of A) by A2,A5;
A8: [ f21,f22 ] in (the carrier' of [: A,B :]);
assume A9: ( F . x1 ) = ( F . x2 );
A10: [ f11,f12 ] in (the carrier' of [: A,B :]);
A11: [ f12,f11 ] = [ f12,( ( pr1 (A,B) ) . (f11,f12) ) ] by FUNCT_3:def 4
.= [ ( ( pr2 (A,B) ) . (f11,f12) ),( ( pr1 (A,B) ) . (f11,f12) ) ] by FUNCT_3:def 5
.= ( F . (f21,f22) ) by A1,A4,A7,A10,A9,FUNCT_3:49
.= [ ( ( pr2 (A,B) ) . (f21,f22) ),( ( pr1 (A,B) ) . (f21,f22) ) ] by A1,A8,FUNCT_3:49
.= [ f22,( ( pr1 (A,B) ) . (f21,f22) ) ] by FUNCT_3:def 5
.= [ f22,f21 ] by FUNCT_3:def 4;
then x12 = x22 by ZFMISC_1:27;
hence x1 = x2 by A4,A7,A11,ZFMISC_1:27;
end;
hence F is  one-to-one by FUNCT_2:19;
thus ( rng F ) c= (the carrier' of [: B,A :]);
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier' of [: B,A :]);
then consider x1,x2 being set such that A12: x1 in (the carrier' of B) and A13: x2 in (the carrier' of A) and A14: x = [ x1,x2 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider x2 as (Morphism of A) by A13;
reconsider x1 as (Morphism of B) by A12;
( F . [ x2,x1 ] ) = [ ( ( pr2 (A,B) ) . (x2,x1) ),( ( pr1 (A,B) ) . (x2,x1) ) ] by A1,FUNCT_3:49
.= [ x1,( ( pr1 (A,B) ) . (x2,x1) ) ] by FUNCT_3:def 5
.= [ x1,x2 ] by FUNCT_3:def 4;
hence thesis by A14,FUNCT_2:4;
