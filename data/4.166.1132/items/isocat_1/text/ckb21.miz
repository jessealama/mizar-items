theorem
[: ( 1Cat (o,m) ),A :] ~= A
proof
take F = ( pr2 (( 1Cat (o,m) ),A) );
set X = [: (the carrier' of ( 1Cat (o,m) )),(the carrier' of A) :];
now
let x1 being set;
let x2 being set;
assume x1 in X;
then consider x11,x12 being set such that A1: x11 in (the carrier' of ( 1Cat (o,m) )) and A2: x12 in (the carrier' of A) and A3: x1 = [ x11,x12 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
assume x2 in X;
then consider x21,x22 being set such that A4: x21 in (the carrier' of ( 1Cat (o,m) )) and A5: x22 in (the carrier' of A) and A6: x2 = [ x21,x22 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider f11 = x11,f21 = x21 as (Morphism of ( 1Cat (o,m) )) by A1,A4;
assume A7: ( F . x1 ) = ( F . x2 );
reconsider f12 = x12,f22 = x22 as (Morphism of A) by A2,A5;
A8: f11 = m by TARSKI:def 1
.= f21 by TARSKI:def 1;
f12 = ( F . (f11,f12) ) by FUNCT_3:def 5
.= ( F . (f21,f22) ) by A3,A6,A7
.= f22 by FUNCT_3:def 5;
hence x1 = x2 by A3,A6,A8;
end;
hence F is  one-to-one by FUNCT_2:19;
thus thesis by FUNCT_3:46;
end;
