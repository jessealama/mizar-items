theorem
Th96: (for T being (Function of (the carrier' of C),(the carrier' of D)) holds ((((for c being (Object of C) holds (ex d being (Object of D) st ( T . ( id c ) ) = ( id d ))) & (for f being (Morphism of C) holds (( T . ( id ( dom f ) ) ) = ( id ( dom ( T . f ) ) ) & ( T . ( id ( cod f ) ) ) = ( id ( cod ( T . f ) ) )))) & (for f,g being (Morphism of C) holds (( dom g ) = ( cod f ) implies ( T . ( g * f ) ) = ( ( T . g ) * ( T . f ) )))) implies T is (Functor of C,D)))
proof
let T being (Function of (the carrier' of C),(the carrier' of D));
assume that
A1: (for c being (Object of C) holds (ex d being (Object of D) st ( T . ( id c ) ) = ( id d )))
and
A2: (for f being (Morphism of C) holds (( T . ( id ( dom f ) ) ) = ( id ( dom ( T . f ) ) ) & ( T . ( id ( cod f ) ) ) = ( id ( cod ( T . f ) ) )))
and
A3: (for f,g being (Morphism of C) holds (( dom g ) = ( cod f ) implies ( T . ( g * f ) ) = ( ( T . g ) * ( T . f ) )));
thus (for c being (Element of C) holds (ex d being (Element of D) st ( T . ( (the Id of C) . c ) ) = ( (the Id of D) . d )))
proof
let c being (Element of C);
(ex d being (Object of D) st ( T . ( id c ) ) = ( id d )) by A1;
hence thesis;
end;

thus (for f being (Element of (the carrier' of C)) holds (( T . ( (the Id of C) . ( (the Source of C) . f ) ) ) = ( (the Id of D) . ( (the Source of D) . ( T . f ) ) ) & ( T . ( (the Id of C) . ( (the Target of C) . f ) ) ) = ( (the Id of D) . ( (the Target of D) . ( T . f ) ) )))
proof
let f being (Element of (the carrier' of C));
A4: (( (the Id of C) . ( cod f ) ) = ( id ( cod f ) ) & ( (the Id of D) . ( cod ( T . f ) ) ) = ( id ( cod ( T . f ) ) ));
(( (the Id of C) . ( dom f ) ) = ( id ( dom f ) ) & ( (the Id of D) . ( dom ( T . f ) ) ) = ( id ( dom ( T . f ) ) ));
hence thesis by A2,A4;
end;

let f being (Element of (the carrier' of C));
let g being (Element of (the carrier' of C));
assume [ g,f ] in ( dom (the Comp of C) );
then A5: ( dom g ) = ( cod f ) by CKB18:def 1;
then ( id ( dom ( T . g ) ) ) = ( T . ( id ( cod f ) ) ) by A2
.= ( id ( cod ( T . f ) ) ) by A2;
then A6: ( (the Comp of D) . (( T . g ),( T . f )) ) = ( ( T . g ) * ( T . f ) ) by CKB28:1,CKB32:1;
( (the Comp of C) . (g,f) ) = ( g * f ) by A5,CKB28:1;
hence thesis by A3,A5,A6;
