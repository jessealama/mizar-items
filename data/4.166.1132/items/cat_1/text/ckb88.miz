definition
let C;
let D;
let F being (Function of (the carrier' of C),(the carrier' of D));
assume A1: (for c being (Element of C) holds (ex d being (Element of D) st ( F . ( (the Id of C) . c ) ) = ( (the Id of D) . d )));
func Obj F -> (Function of (the carrier of C),(the carrier of D)) means

existence
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(for d being (Element of D) holds (( F . ( (the Id of C) . $1 ) ) = ( (the Id of D) . d ) implies $2 = d));
A2: (for c being (Element of C) holds (ex y being (Element of D) st P[ c,y ]))
proof
let c being (Element of C);
consider y being (Element of D) such that A3: ( F . ( (the Id of C) . c ) ) = ( (the Id of D) . y ) by A1;
take y;
let d being (Element of D);
A4: (( id d ) = ( (the Id of D) . d ) & ( id y ) = ( (the Id of D) . y ));
assume ( F . ( (the Id of C) . c ) ) = ( (the Id of D) . d );

uniqueness
proof
let F1 being (Function of (the carrier of C),(the carrier of D));
let F2 being (Function of (the carrier of C),(the carrier of D));
assume that
A5: (for c being (Element of C) holds (for d being (Element of D) holds (( F . ( (the Id of C) . c ) ) = ( (the Id of D) . d ) implies ( F1 . c ) = d)))
and
A6: (for c being (Element of C) holds (for d being (Element of D) holds (( F . ( (the Id of C) . c ) ) = ( (the Id of D) . d ) implies ( F2 . c ) = d)));
(for c being (Element of C) holds ( F1 . c ) = ( F2 . c ))
proof
let c being (Element of C);
consider d1 being (Element of D) such that A7: ( F . ( (the Id of C) . c ) ) = ( (the Id of D) . d1 ) by A1;
( F1 . c ) = d1 by A5,A7;
