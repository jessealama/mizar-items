theorem
(for C being non  void non  empty CatStr holds (((((for f,g being (Morphism of C) holds ([ g,f ] in ( dom (the Comp of C) ) iff ( dom g ) = ( cod f ))) & (for f,g being (Morphism of C) holds (( dom g ) = ( cod f ) implies (( dom ( g * f ) ) = ( dom f ) & ( cod ( g * f ) ) = ( cod g ))))) & (for f,g,h being (Morphism of C) holds ((( dom h ) = ( cod g ) & ( dom g ) = ( cod f )) implies ( h * ( g * f ) ) = ( ( h * g ) * f )))) & (for b being (Object of C) holds (((( dom ( id b ) ) = b & ( cod ( id b ) ) = b) & (for f being (Morphism of C) holds (( cod f ) = b implies ( ( id b ) * f ) = f))) & (for g being (Morphism of C) holds (( dom g ) = b implies ( g * ( id b ) ) = g))))) implies C is  Category-like))
proof
let C being non  void non  empty CatStr;
set CP = (the Comp of C);
set CD = (the Source of C);
set CC = (the Target of C);
set CI = (the Id of C);
assume that
A1: (for f,g being (Morphism of C) holds ([ g,f ] in ( dom CP ) iff ( dom g ) = ( cod f )))
and
A2: (for f,g being (Morphism of C) holds (( dom g ) = ( cod f ) implies (( dom ( g * f ) ) = ( dom f ) & ( cod ( g * f ) ) = ( cod g ))))
and
A3: (for f,g,h being (Morphism of C) holds ((( dom h ) = ( cod g ) & ( dom g ) = ( cod f )) implies ( h * ( g * f ) ) = ( ( h * g ) * f )))
and
A4: (for b being (Object of C) holds (((( dom ( id b ) ) = b & ( cod ( id b ) ) = b) & (for f being (Morphism of C) holds (( cod f ) = b implies ( ( id b ) * f ) = f))) & (for g being (Morphism of C) holds (( dom g ) = b implies ( g * ( id b ) ) = g))));
thus A5: (for f,g being (Element of (the carrier' of C)) holds ([ g,f ] in ( dom CP ) iff ( CD . g ) = ( CC . f )))
proof
let f being (Element of (the carrier' of C));
let g being (Element of (the carrier' of C));
(( CD . g ) = ( dom g ) & ( CC . f ) = ( cod f ));
hence thesis by A1;
end;

thus A6: (for f,g being (Element of (the carrier' of C)) holds (( CD . g ) = ( CC . f ) implies (( CD . ( CP . (g,f) ) ) = ( CD . f ) & ( CC . ( CP . (g,f) ) ) = ( CC . g ))))
proof
let f being (Element of (the carrier' of C));
let g being (Element of (the carrier' of C));
assume that
A7: ( CD . g ) = ( CC . f );
(( CD . g ) = ( dom g ) & ( CC . f ) = ( cod f ));
then A8: (( dom ( g * f ) ) = ( dom f ) & ( cod ( g * f ) ) = ( cod g )) by A2,A7;
[ g,f ] in ( dom CP ) by A5,A7;
hence thesis by A8,CKB5:def 1;
end;

thus (for f,g,h being (Element of (the carrier' of C)) holds ((( CD . h ) = ( CC . g ) & ( CD . g ) = ( CC . f )) implies ( CP . (h,( CP . (g,f) )) ) = ( CP . (( CP . (h,g) ),f) )))
proof
let f being (Element of (the carrier' of C));
let g being (Element of (the carrier' of C));
let h being (Element of (the carrier' of C));
assume that
A9: ( CD . h ) = ( CC . g )
and
A10: ( CD . g ) = ( CC . f );
A11: (( CD . g ) = ( dom g ) & ( CC . f ) = ( cod f ));
[ g,f ] in ( dom CP ) by A5,A10;
then A12: ( g * f ) = ( CP . (g,f) ) by CKB5:def 1;
[ h,g ] in ( dom CP ) by A5,A9;
then A13: ( h * g ) = ( CP . (h,g) ) by CKB5:def 1;
( CC . ( CP . (g,f) ) ) = ( CC . g ) by A6,A10;
then [ h,( g * f ) ] in ( dom CP ) by A5,A9,A12;
then A14: ( CP . (h,( g * f )) ) = ( h * ( g * f ) ) by CKB5:def 1;
( CD . ( CP . (h,g) ) ) = ( CD . g ) by A6,A9;
then [ ( h * g ),f ] in ( dom CP ) by A5,A10,A13;
then A15: ( CP . (( h * g ),f) ) = ( ( h * g ) * f ) by CKB5:def 1;
(( CD . h ) = ( dom h ) & ( CC . g ) = ( cod g ));
hence thesis by A3,A9,A10,A11,A12,A13,A14,A15;
end;

let b being (Element of C);
(( dom ( id b ) ) = b & ( cod ( id b ) ) = b) by A4;
hence (( CD . ( CI . b ) ) = b & ( CC . ( CI . b ) ) = b);
thus (for f being (Element of (the carrier' of C)) holds (( CC . f ) = b implies ( CP . (( CI . b ),f) ) = f))
proof
let f being (Element of (the carrier' of C));
assume that
A16: ( CC . f ) = b;
( CC . f ) = ( cod f );
then A17: ( ( id b ) * f ) = f by A4,A16;
( dom ( id b ) ) = b by A4;
then [ ( CI . b ),f ] in ( dom CP ) by A5,A16;
hence thesis by A17,CKB5:def 1;
end;

let g being (Element of (the carrier' of C));
assume that
A18: ( CD . g ) = b;
( CD . g ) = ( dom g );
then A19: ( g * ( id b ) ) = g by A4,A18;
( cod ( id b ) ) = b by A4;
then [ g,( CI . b ) ] in ( dom CP ) by A5,A18;
hence thesis by A19,CKB5:def 1;
