theorem
Th5: (ex A st d in ( Collapse (E,A) ))
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(not (ex A st $1 in ( Collapse (E,A) )));
defpred R[ set,set ]
 means
(ex A st (($2 = A & $1 in ( Collapse (E,A) )) & (for B holds ($1 in ( Collapse (E,B) ) implies A c= B))));
consider X such that A1: (x in X iff (x in E & P[ x ])) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
now
given x such that
A2: x in X;

consider m being set such that A3: m in X and A4: (not (ex x st (x in X & x in m))) by A2,TARSKI:2;
reconsider m as (Element of E) by A1,A3;
A5:now
let x;
defpred Q[ Ordinal ]
 means
x in ( Collapse (E,$1) );
assume A6: x in ( m /\ E );
then x in m by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A7: (not x in X) by A4;
x in E by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A8: (ex A st Q[ A ]) by A1,A7;
(ex A st (Q[ A ] & (for B holds (Q[ B ] implies A c= B)))) from ORDINAL1:sch 1(A8);
hence (ex y st R[ x,y ]);
end;
consider f such that A9: (( dom f ) = ( m /\ E ) & (for x holds (x in ( m /\ E ) implies R[ x,( f . x ) ]))) from CLASSES1:sch 1(A5);
(y in ( rng f ) implies y is Ordinal)
proof
assume y in ( rng f );
then consider x such that A10: x in ( dom f ) and A11: y = ( f . x ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
(ex A st ((( f . x ) = A & x in ( Collapse (E,A) )) & (for B holds (x in ( Collapse (E,B) ) implies A c= B)))) by A9,A10;
hence thesis by A11;
end;
then consider A such that A12: ( rng f ) c= A by ORDINAL1:24;
(for d holds (d in m implies (ex B st (B in A & d in ( Collapse (E,B) )))))
proof
let d;
assume d in m;
then A13: d in ( m /\ E ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider B such that A14: ( f . d ) = B and A15: d in ( Collapse (E,B) ) and (for C holds (d in ( Collapse (E,C) ) implies B c= C)) by A9;
take B;
B in ( rng f ) by A9,A13,A14,FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A12,A15;
end;
then m in { d9: (for d holds (d in d9 implies (ex B st (B in A & d in ( Collapse (E,B) ))))) };
then m in ( Collapse (E,A) ) by CKB2:1;
hence contradiction by A1,A3;
end;
then A16: (not d in X);
assume (not thesis);
hence contradiction by A1,A16;
end;
