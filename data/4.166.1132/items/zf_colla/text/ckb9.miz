theorem
Th8: (ex A st E = ( Collapse (E,A) ))
proof
defpred R[ set,set ]
 means
(ex A st (($2 = A & $1 in ( Collapse (E,A) )) & (for B holds ($1 in ( Collapse (E,B) ) implies A c= B))));
A1:now
let x;
assume x in E;
then reconsider d = x as (Element of E);
defpred Q[ Ordinal ]
 means
d in ( Collapse (E,$1) );
A2: (ex A st Q[ A ]) by CKB6:1;
(ex A st (Q[ A ] & (for B holds (Q[ B ] implies A c= B)))) from ORDINAL1:sch 1(A2);
hence (ex y st R[ x,y ]);
end;
consider f such that A3: (( dom f ) = E & (for x holds (x in E implies R[ x,( f . x ) ]))) from CLASSES1:sch 1(A1);
(x in ( rng f ) implies x is Ordinal)
proof
assume x in ( rng f );
then consider y such that A4: y in ( dom f ) and A5: x = ( f . y ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
(ex A st ((( f . y ) = A & y in ( Collapse (E,A) )) & (for C holds (y in ( Collapse (E,C) ) implies A c= C)))) by A3,A4;
hence thesis by A5;
end;
then consider A such that A6: ( rng f ) c= A by ORDINAL1:24;
take A;
thus (x in E implies x in ( Collapse (E,A) ))
proof
assume A7: x in E;
then consider B such that A8: ( f . x ) = B and A9: x in ( Collapse (E,B) ) and (for C holds (x in ( Collapse (E,C) ) implies B c= C)) by A3;
B in ( rng f ) by A3,A7,A8,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then B c= A by A6,ORDINAL1:def 2;
then ( Collapse (E,B) ) c= ( Collapse (E,A) ) by CKB5:1;
hence thesis by A9;
end;

thus thesis by CKB8:1;
end;
