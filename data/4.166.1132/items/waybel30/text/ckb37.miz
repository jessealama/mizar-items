(for N being  meet-continuous  Lawson  complete TopLattice holds (( InclPoset ( sigma N ) ) is  continuous implies (N is  Hausdorff iff (for X being (Subset of [: N,(N qua TopSpace) :]) holds (X = (the InternalRel of N) implies X is  closed)))))
proof
let N being  meet-continuous  Lawson  complete TopLattice;
