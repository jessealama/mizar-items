theorem
(for N being  Lawson  complete TopLattice holds (for T being  complete LATTICE holds (for A being  Lawson  correct (TopAugmentation of T) holds (( the RelStr of N ) = ( the RelStr of T ) implies ( the TopRelStr of A ) = ( the TopRelStr of N )))))
proof
let N being  Lawson  complete TopLattice;
let T being  complete LATTICE;
let A being  Lawson  correct (TopAugmentation of T);
assume that
A1: ( the RelStr of N ) = ( the RelStr of T );
A2: ( omega T ) = ( omega N ) by A1,WAYBEL19:3;
set S = the  Scott  correct (TopAugmentation of T);
set l = the  lower  correct (TopAugmentation of T);
A3: ( the RelStr of l ) = ( the RelStr of T ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
A4: ( the RelStr of S ) = ( the RelStr of T ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
( (the topology of S) \/ (the topology of l) ) c= ( bool (the carrier of N) )
proof
let a being set;
assume a in ( (the topology of S) \/ (the topology of l) );
then (a in (the topology of S) or a in (the topology of l)) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence thesis by A1,A4,A3;
end;
then reconsider X = ( (the topology of S) \/ (the topology of l) ) as (Subset-Family of N);
reconsider X as (Subset-Family of N);
A5: (the topology of l) = ( omega T ) by WAYBEL19:def 2;
( ( sigma N ) \/ ( omega N ) ) is (prebasis of N) by WAYBEL19:def 3;
then A6: ( ( sigma T ) \/ ( omega N ) ) is (prebasis of N) by A1,YELLOW_9:52;
A7: (the topology of S) = ( sigma T ) by YELLOW_9:51;
(the carrier of N) = ( (the carrier of S) \/ (the carrier of l) ) by A1,A4,A3;
then N is (Refinement of S,l) by A2,A6,A5,A7,YELLOW_9:def 6;
then A8: (the topology of N) = ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl X ) ) by YELLOW_9:56
.= ( lambda T ) by A1,A5,A7,WAYBEL19:33
.= (the topology of A) by WAYBEL19:def 4;
( the RelStr of A ) = ( the RelStr of N ) by A1,YELLOW_9:def 4;
hence thesis by A8;
