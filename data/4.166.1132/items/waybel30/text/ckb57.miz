theorem
Th31: (for N being  topological_semilattice  with_infima TopPoset holds (for C being (Subset of N) holds (( subrelstr C ) is  meet-inheriting implies ( subrelstr ( Cl C ) ) is  meet-inheriting)))
proof
let N being  topological_semilattice  with_infima TopPoset;
let C being (Subset of N);
assume that
A1: ( subrelstr C ) is  meet-inheriting;
set A = ( Cl C );
set S = ( subrelstr A );
let x being (Element of N);
let y being (Element of N);
assume that
A2: x in (the carrier of S)
and
A3: y in (the carrier of S)
and
 ex_inf_of { x,y },N;
A4: (the carrier of S) = A by YELLOW_0:def 15;
(for V being (a_neighborhood of ( x "/\" y )) holds V meets C)
proof
set NN = [: N,(N qua TopSpace) :];
let V being (a_neighborhood of ( x "/\" y ));
A5: (the carrier of NN) = [: (the carrier of N),(the carrier of N) :] by BORSUK_1:def 2;
then reconsider xy = [ x,y ] as (Point of NN) by YELLOW_3:def 2;
(the carrier of [: N,N :]) = [: (the carrier of N),(the carrier of N) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then reconsider f = ( inf_op N ) as (Function of NN,N) by A5;
A6: ( f . xy ) = ( f . (x,y) )
.= ( x "/\" y ) by WAYBEL_2:def 4;
f is  continuous by YELLOW13:def 5;
then consider H being (a_neighborhood of xy) such that A7: ( f .: H ) c= V by A6,BORSUK_1:def 1;
consider A being (Subset-Family of NN) such that A8: ( Int H ) = ( union A ) and A9: (for e being set holds (e in A implies (ex X1,Y1 being (Subset of N) st ((e = [: X1,Y1 :] & X1 is  open) & Y1 is  open)))) by BORSUK_1:5;
xy in ( union A ) by A8,CONNSP_2:def 1;
then consider K being set such that A10: xy in K and A11: K in A by TARSKI:def 4;
consider Ix,Iy being (Subset of N) such that A12: K = [: Ix,Iy :] and A13: Ix is  open and A14: Iy is  open by A9,A11;
A15: x in Ix by A10,A12,ZFMISC_1:87;
A16: y in Iy by A10,A12,ZFMISC_1:87;
A17: Ix = ( Int Ix ) by A13,TOPS_1:23;
Iy = ( Int Iy ) by A14,TOPS_1:23;
then reconsider Iy as (a_neighborhood of y) by A16,CONNSP_2:def 1;
Iy meets C by A3,A4,CONNSP_2:27;
then consider iy being set such that A18: iy in Iy and A19: iy in C by XBOOLE_0:3;
reconsider Ix as (a_neighborhood of x) by A15,A17,CONNSP_2:def 1;
Ix meets C by A2,A4,CONNSP_2:27;
then consider ix being set such that A20: ix in Ix and A21: ix in C by XBOOLE_0:3;
reconsider ix,iy as (Element of N) by A20,A18;
now
[ ix,iy ] in K by A12,A20,A18,ZFMISC_1:87;
then A22: [ ix,iy ] in ( Int H ) by A8,A11,TARSKI:def 4;
take a = ( ix "/\" iy );
A23: ( dom f ) = (the carrier of [: N,N :]) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A24: ( Int H ) c= H by TOPS_1:16;
( f . (ix,iy) ) = ( ix "/\" iy ) by WAYBEL_2:def 4;
then ( ix "/\" iy ) in ( f .: H ) by A24,A23,A22,FUNCT_1:def 6;
hence a in V by A7;
A25:  ex_inf_of { ix,iy },N by YELLOW_0:21;
(the carrier of ( subrelstr C )) = C by YELLOW_0:def 15;
then ( inf { ix,iy } ) in C by A25,A1,A21,A19,YELLOW_0:def 16;
hence a in C by YELLOW_0:40;
end;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
then ( x "/\" y ) in ( Cl C ) by CONNSP_2:27;
hence thesis by A4,YELLOW_0:40;
