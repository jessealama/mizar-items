theorem
Th13: (for N being  meet-continuous LATTICE holds (for A being (Subset of N) holds (A is  property(S) implies ( uparrow A ) is  property(S))))
proof
let N being  meet-continuous LATTICE;
let A being (Subset of N);
assume that
A1: (for D being non  empty  directed (Subset of N) holds (( sup D ) in A implies (ex y being (Element of N) st (y in D & (for x being (Element of N) holds ((x in D & x >= y) implies x in A))))));
let D being non  empty  directed (Subset of N);
assume ( sup D ) in ( uparrow A );
then consider a being (Element of N) such that A2: a <= ( sup D ) and A3: a in A by WAYBEL_0:def 16;
reconsider aa = { a } as non  empty  directed (Subset of N) by WAYBEL_0:5;
a = ( sup ( { a } "/\" D ) ) by A2,WAYBEL_2:52;
then consider y being (Element of N) such that A4: y in ( aa "/\" D ) and A5: (for x being (Element of N) holds ((x in ( aa "/\" D ) & x >= y) implies x in A)) by A1,A3;
( aa "/\" D ) = { ( a "/\" d ) where d is (Element of N): d in D } by YELLOW_4:42;
then consider d being (Element of N) such that A6: y = ( a "/\" d ) and A7: d in D by A4;
take d;
thus d in D by A7;
let x being (Element of N);
assume that
x in D
and
A8: x >= d;
d >= y by A6,YELLOW_0:23;
then A9: x >= y by A8,ORDERS_2:3;
y in A by A4,A5,ORDERS_2:1;
hence thesis by A9,WAYBEL_0:def 16;
