theorem
Th3: (for R being non  empty  reflexive  transitive RelStr holds (for D being non  empty  directed (Subset of ( InclPoset ( Ids R ) )) holds ( sup D ) = ( union D )))
proof
let R being non  empty  reflexive  transitive RelStr;
let D being non  empty  directed (Subset of ( InclPoset ( Ids R ) ));
reconsider UD = ( union D ) as (Ideal of R) by CKB2:1;
A1:  ex_sup_of D,( InclPoset ( Ids R ) ) by WAYBEL_0:75;
UD in ( Ids R );
