theorem
Th16: (for N being  meet-continuous  Lawson  complete TopLattice holds (for S being  Scott (TopAugmentation of N) holds (for x being (Point of S) holds (for y being (Point of N) holds (for J being (Basis of y) holds (x = y implies { ( uparrow A ) where A is (Subset of N): A in J } is (Basis of x)))))))
proof
let N being  meet-continuous  Lawson  complete TopLattice;
let S being  Scott (TopAugmentation of N);
let x being (Point of S);
let y being (Point of N);
let J being (Basis of y);
assume that
A1: x = y;
set Z = { ( uparrow A ) where A is (Subset of N): A in J };
set K = Z;
A2: ( the RelStr of N ) = ( the RelStr of S ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
K c= ( bool (the carrier of S) )
proof
let k being set;
assume k in K;
then (ex A being (Subset of N) st (k = ( uparrow A ) & A in J));
hence thesis by A2;
end;
then reconsider K as (Subset-Family of S);
K is (Basis of x)
proof
A3: K is  open
proof
let k being (Subset of S);
assume k in K;
then consider A being (Subset of N) such that A4: k = ( uparrow A ) and A5: A in J;
reconsider A9 = A as (Subset of S) by A2;
( uparrow A9 ) is  open by A5,CKB28:1,YELLOW_8:12;
then ( uparrow A9 ) in (the topology of S) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then ( uparrow A ) in (the topology of S) by A2,WAYBEL_0:13;
hence thesis by A4,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
end;
K is x -quasi_basis
proof
(for k being set holds (k in K implies x in k))
proof
let k being set;
assume k in K;
then consider A being (Subset of N) such that A6: k = ( uparrow A ) and A7: A in J;
A8: A c= ( uparrow A ) by WAYBEL_0:16;
y in ( Intersect J ) by YELLOW_8:def 1;
then y in A by A7,SETFAM_1:43;
hence thesis by A8,A1,A6;
end;
hence x in ( Intersect K ) by SETFAM_1:43;
let sA being (Subset of S);
assume that
A9: sA is  open
and
A10: x in sA;
sA is  upper by A9,WAYBEL11:def 4;
then A11: ( uparrow sA ) c= sA by WAYBEL_0:24;
reconsider lA = sA as (Subset of N) by A2;
N is  Lawson  correct  Lawson  correct (TopAugmentation of S) by A2,YELLOW_9:def 4;
then lA is  open by A9,WAYBEL19:37;
then lA in ( lambda N ) by CKB19:1;
then A12: ( uparrow lA ) in ( sigma S ) by CKB27:1;
A13: lA c= ( uparrow lA ) by WAYBEL_0:16;
( sigma N ) c= ( lambda N ) by CKB17:1;
then ( sigma S ) c= ( lambda N ) by A2,YELLOW_9:52;
then ( uparrow lA ) is  open by A12,CKB19:1;
then consider lV1 being (Subset of N) such that A14: lV1 in J and A15: lV1 c= ( uparrow lA ) by A13,A1,A10,YELLOW_8:def 1;
reconsider sUV = ( uparrow lV1 ) as (Subset of S) by A2;
take sUV;
thus sUV in K by A14;
A16: lV1 is_coarser_than ( uparrow lA ) by A15,WAYBEL12:16;
sA c= ( uparrow sA ) by WAYBEL_0:16;
then A17: sA = ( uparrow sA ) by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
( uparrow sA ) = ( uparrow lA ) by A2,WAYBEL_0:13;
hence thesis by A16,A17,YELLOW12:28;
end;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
hence thesis;
