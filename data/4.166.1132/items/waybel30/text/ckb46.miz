theorem
Th30: (for N being  Lawson  complete TopLattice holds (N is  continuous iff N is  meet-continuous  Hausdorff))
proof
let N being  Lawson  complete TopLattice;
thus (N is  continuous implies N is  meet-continuous  Hausdorff);
assume A1: N is  meet-continuous  Hausdorff;
thus A2: (for x being (Element of N) holds ( waybelow x ) is non  empty  directed);
thus N is  up-complete;
(for x,y being (Element of N) holds ((not x <= y) implies (ex u being (Element of N) st (u << x & (not u <= y)))))
proof
reconsider J = { ( O \ ( uparrow F ) ) where O is (Subset of N),F is (Subset of N): (O in ( sigma N ) & F is  finite) } as (Basis of N) by WAYBEL19:32;
set S = the  Scott (TopAugmentation of N);
A3: (for N being Semilattice holds (for x,y being (Element of N) holds ((ex u being (Element of N) st (u << x & (not u <= ( x "/\" y )))) implies (ex u being (Element of N) st (u << x & (not u <= y))))))
proof
let N being Semilattice;
let x being (Element of N);
let y being (Element of N);
given u being (Element of N) such that
A4: u << x
and
A5: (not u <= ( x "/\" y ));

take u;
thus u << x by A4;
assume A6: u <= y;
u <= x by A4,WAYBEL_3:1;
then ( u "/\" u ) <= ( x "/\" y ) by A6,YELLOW_3:2;
hence contradiction by A5,YELLOW_0:25;
end;
let x being (Element of N);
let y being (Element of N);
assume (not x <= y);
then ( x "/\" y ) <> x by YELLOW_0:23;
then consider W,V being (Subset of N) such that A7: W is  open and A8: V is  open and A9: x in W and A10: ( x "/\" y ) in V and A11: W misses V by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 10;
V = ( union { G where G is (Subset of N): (G in J & G c= V) } ) by A8,YELLOW_8:9;

U2 in ( sigma S ) by A20,A18,YELLOW_9:52;
then A23: U1 is  open by WAYBEL14:24;
then A24: U1 is  upper by WAYBEL11:def 4;
WU1 c= ( uparrow F )
proof
A25: W misses V1 by A11,A16,XBOOLE_1:63;
A26: ( WU1 \ ( uparrow F ) ) c= ( U1 \ ( uparrow F ) ) by XBOOLE_1:17,XBOOLE_1:33;
let w being set;
assume that
A27: w in WU1
and
A28: (not w in ( uparrow F ));
A29: w in W by A27,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
w in ( WU1 \ ( uparrow F ) ) by A27,A28,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence contradiction by A26,A17,A29,A25,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
then WU1 is_coarser_than ( uparrow F ) by WAYBEL12:16;

N is  Lawson  correct  Lawson  correct (TopAugmentation of S) by A20,YELLOW_9:def 4;
then U2 is  open by A23,WAYBEL19:37;
then ( uparrow W1 ) c= ( Int ( uparrow F1 ) ) by A7,A1,A30,A22,A34,CKB28:1,TOPS_1:24;

S is  meet-continuous by A1,A20,YELLOW12:14;
then ( Int ( uparrow F1 ) ) c= ( union { ( wayabove u ) where u is (Element of S): u in F1 } ) by CKB45:1;
then consider A being set such that A36: x in A and A37: A in { ( wayabove u ) where u is (Element of S): u in F1 } by A35,TARSKI:def 4;
consider u being (Element of S) such that A38: A = ( wayabove u ) and A39: u in F1 by A37;
reconsider u1 = u as (Element of N) by A20;
A40: ( wayabove u1 ) = ( wayabove u ) by A20,YELLOW12:13;
now
take u1;
thus u1 << x by A36,A38,A40,WAYBEL_3:8;
( uparrow u1 ) c= ( uparrow F ) by A39,YELLOW12:30;
then (not ( x "/\" y ) in ( uparrow u1 )) by A12,A14,A17,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence (not u1 <= ( x "/\" y )) by WAYBEL_0:18;
end;
then consider u2 being (Element of N) such that A41: u2 << x and A42: (not u2 <= y) by A3;
take u2;
thus thesis by A41,A42;
end;
hence thesis by A2,WAYBEL_3:24;
