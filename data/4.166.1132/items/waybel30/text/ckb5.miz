theorem
Th4: (for R being Semilattice holds (for D being non  empty  directed (Subset of ( InclPoset ( Ids R ) )) holds (for x being (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids R ) )) holds ( sup ( { x } "/\" D ) ) = ( union { ( x /\ d ) where d is (Element of D): (not contradiction) } ))))
proof
let R being Semilattice;
let D being non  empty  directed (Subset of ( InclPoset ( Ids R ) ));
let x being (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids R ) ));
set I = ( InclPoset ( Ids R ) );
set A = { ( x /\ d ) where d is (Element of D): (not contradiction) };
set xD = { ( x "/\" d ) where d is (Element of I): d in D };
xD c= (the carrier of I)
proof
let a being set;
assume a in xD;
then (ex d being (Element of I) st (a = ( x "/\" d ) & d in D));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider xD as (Subset of I);
A1:  ex_sup_of ( { x } "/\" D ),I by WAYBEL_2:1;
then  ex_sup_of xD,I by YELLOW_4:42;
then A2: ( sup xD ) is_>=_than xD by YELLOW_0:def 9;
hereby
set A = { ( x /\ w ) where w is (Element of D): (not contradiction) };
let a being set;
 ex_sup_of D,I by WAYBEL_0:75;
then ( sup ( { x } "/\" D ) ) <= ( x "/\" ( sup D ) ) by A1,YELLOW_4:53;
then A3: ( sup ( { x } "/\" D ) ) c= ( x "/\" ( sup D ) ) by YELLOW_1:3;
assume a in ( sup ( { x } "/\" D ) );
then a in ( x "/\" ( sup D ) ) by A3;
then A4: a in ( x /\ ( sup D ) ) by YELLOW_2:43;
then a in ( sup D ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then a in ( union D ) by CKB4:1;
then consider d being set such that A5: a in d and A6: d in D by TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider d as (Element of I) by A6;
A7: ( x /\ d ) in A by A6;
a in x by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then a in ( x /\ d ) by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence a in ( union A ) by A7,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
let a being set;
assume a in ( union A );
then consider Z being set such that A8: a in Z and A9: Z in A by TARSKI:def 4;
consider d being (Element of D) such that A10: Z = ( x /\ d ) and (not contradiction) by A9;
reconsider d as (Element of I);
A11: xD = ( { x } "/\" D ) by YELLOW_4:42;
then ( x "/\" d ) in ( { x } "/\" D );
then ( sup xD ) >= ( x "/\" d ) by A2,A11,LATTICE3:def 9;
then A12: ( x "/\" d ) c= ( sup xD ) by YELLOW_1:3;
( x /\ d ) = ( x "/\" d ) by YELLOW_2:43;
then a in ( sup xD ) by A12,A8,A10;
hence thesis by YELLOW_4:42;
