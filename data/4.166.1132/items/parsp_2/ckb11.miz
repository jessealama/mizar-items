theorem
Lm7: (( K - L ) = ( N - M ) implies M = ( ( L + N ) - K ))
proof
assume ( K - L ) = ( N - M );
then ( M + ( K + ( - L ) ) ) = ( M + ( N - M ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 11;
then ( M + ( K + ( - L ) ) ) = ( M + ( N + ( - M ) ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 11;
then ( ( M + K ) + ( - L ) ) = ( M + ( N + ( - M ) ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 3;
then ( ( M + K ) + ( - L ) ) = ( ( M + N ) + ( - M ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 3;
then ( ( M + K ) - L ) = ( ( N + M ) + ( - M ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 11;
then ( ( M + K ) - L ) = ( N + ( M + ( - M ) ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 3;
then ( ( M + K ) - L ) = ( N + ( 0. F ) ) by RLVECT_1:5;
then ( ( ( M + K ) - L ) + L ) = ( N + L ) by RLVECT_1:4;
then ( ( ( M + K ) + ( - L ) ) + L ) = ( N + L ) by RLVECT_1:def 11;
then ( ( M + K ) + ( ( - L ) + L ) ) = ( N + L ) by RLVECT_1:def 3;
then ( ( M + K ) + ( 0. F ) ) = ( L + N ) by RLVECT_1:5;
then ( ( M + K ) + ( - K ) ) = ( ( L + N ) + ( - K ) ) by RLVECT_1:4;
then ( ( M + K ) + ( - K ) ) = ( ( L + N ) - K ) by RLVECT_1:def 11;
then ( M + ( K + ( - K ) ) ) = ( ( L + N ) - K ) by RLVECT_1:def 3;
then ( M + ( 0. F ) ) = ( ( L + N ) - K ) by RLVECT_1:5;
hence thesis by RLVECT_1:4;
