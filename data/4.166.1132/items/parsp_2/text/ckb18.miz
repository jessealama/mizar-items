theorem
Th8: (((((((not a,p '||' a,b) & (not a,p '||' a,c)) & a,p '||' b,q) & a,p '||' c,r) & a,b '||' p,q) & a,c '||' p,r) implies b,c '||' q,r)
proof
assume that
A1: (not a,p '||' a,b)
and
A2: (not a,p '||' a,c)
and
A3: a,p '||' b,q
and
A4: a,p '||' c,r
and
A5: a,b '||' p,q
and
A6: a,c '||' p,r;
consider i,j,k,l such that A7: [ a,p,c,r ] = [ i,j,k,l ] and ((ex L st ((( L * ( ( i `1 ) - ( j `1 ) ) ) = ( ( k `1 ) - ( l `1 ) ) & ( L * ( ( i `2 ) - ( j `2 ) ) ) = ( ( k `2 ) - ( l `2 ) )) & ( L * ( ( i `3 ) - ( j `3 ) ) ) = ( ( k `3 ) - ( l `3 ) ))) or ((( ( i `1 ) - ( j `1 ) ) = ( 0.

A9: (a = e & p = g) by A8,MCART_1:29;
A10: c = k by A7,MCART_1:29;
then A11: [ a,p,c,r ] = [ e,g,k,l ] by A9,A7,MCART_1:29;
then A12: ( l `1 ) = ( ( ( g `1 ) + ( k `1 ) ) - ( e `1 ) ) by A2,A4,A6,CKB12:1;
A13: b = f by A8,MCART_1:29;
then A14: [ a,p,b,q ] = [ e,g,f,h ] by A8,A9,MCART_1:29;
then ( h `1 ) = ( ( ( g `1 ) + ( f `1 ) ) - ( e `1 ) ) by A1,A3,A5,CKB12:1;
then A15: ( ( 1_ F ) * ( ( f `1 ) - ( k `1 ) ) ) = ( ( h `1 ) - ( l `1 ) ) by A12,CKB15:1;
A16: ( l `3 ) = ( ( ( g `3 ) + ( k `3 ) ) - ( e `3 ) ) by A2,A4,A6,A11,CKB12:1;

( h `3 ) = ( ( ( g `3 ) + ( f `3 ) ) - ( e `3 ) ) by A1,A3,A5,A14,CKB12:1;
then A18: ( ( 1_ F ) * ( ( f `3 ) - ( k `3 ) ) ) = ( ( h `3 ) - ( l `3 ) ) by A16,CKB15:1;
( h `2 ) = ( ( ( g `2 ) + ( f `2 ) ) - ( e `2 ) ) by A1,A3,A5,A14,CKB12:1;
then A19: ( ( 1_ F ) * ( ( f `2 ) - ( k `2 ) ) ) = ( ( h `2 ) - ( l `2 ) ) by A17,CKB15:1;
q = h by A8,MCART_1:29;
then [ b,c,q,r ] = [ f,k,h,l ] by A13,A7,A10,MCART_1:29;
hence thesis by A15,A19,A18,CKB5:1;
