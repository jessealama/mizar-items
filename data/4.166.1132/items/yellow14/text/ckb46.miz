Th30: (for M being non  empty set holds (for J being  TopSpace-yielding  non-Empty (ManySortedSet of M) holds (for x,y being (Point of ( product J )) holds (x in ( Cl { y } ) iff (for i being (Element of M) holds ( x . i ) in ( Cl { ( y . i ) } ))))))
proof
let M being non  empty set;
let J being  TopSpace-yielding  non-Empty (ManySortedSet of M);
let x being (Point of ( product J ));
let y being (Point of ( product J ));
hereby
assume A1: x in ( Cl { y } );
let i being (Element of M);

then x in ( product ( Carrier J ) ) by WAYBEL18:def 3;
then consider f being Function such that A2: x = f and A3: ( dom f ) = ( dom ( Carrier J ) ) and A4: (for z being set holds (z in ( dom ( Carrier J ) ) implies ( f . z ) in ( ( Carrier J ) . z ))) by CARD_3:def 5;

proof
let G being (Subset of ( J . i ));
assume that
A6: G is  open
and

reconsider G9 = G as (Subset of ( J . i ));
(( [#] ( J . i ) ) <> ( {} ) & ( proj (J,i) ) is  continuous) by WAYBEL18:5;

A9: (for z being set holds (z in ( dom ( ( Carrier J ) +* (i,G) ) ) implies ( f . z ) in ( ( ( Carrier J ) +* (i,G) ) . z )))
proof
let z being set;
assume z in ( dom ( ( Carrier J ) +* (i,G) ) );
then A10: z in ( dom ( Carrier J ) ) by FUNCT_7:30;
per cases ;
suppose z = i;

hence thesis by A2,A7,A10,FUNCT_7:31;
end;

A28: (for z being set holds (z in ( dom ( ( Carrier J ) +* (i,V) ) ) implies ( g . z ) in ( ( ( Carrier J ) +* (i,V) ) . z )))
proof
let z being set;
assume A29: z in ( dom ( ( Carrier J ) +* (i,V) ) );
then A30: z in ( dom ( Carrier J ) ) by FUNCT_7:30;
per cases ;
suppose A31: z = i;
