(for n being non empty Nat holds ( Necklace n ) is  connected)
proof
let n being non empty Nat;
given X being (Subset of ( Necklace n )),Y being (Subset of ( Necklace n )) such that
A1: X <> ( {} )
and
A2: Y <> ( {} )
and
A3: ( [#] ( Necklace n ) ) = ( X \/ Y )
and
A4: X misses Y
and
A5: (the InternalRel of ( Necklace n )) = ( ( (the InternalRel of ( Necklace n )) |_2 X ) \/ ( (the InternalRel of ( Necklace n )) |_2 Y ) );

A6: ((the carrier of ( Necklace n )) = n & ( 0 ) in n) by CKB4:1,CKB41:1;
per cases  by A3,A6,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A7: ( 0 ) in X;

then x in n by CKB41:1;
then x is  natural by CKB3:1;
then A9: (ex x being Nat st P[ x ]) by A8;
