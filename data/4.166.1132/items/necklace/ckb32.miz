theorem
Lm1: (for S,R being non empty RelStr holds (S,R are_isomorphic  implies ( card (the InternalRel of S) ) = ( card (the InternalRel of R) )))
proof
let S being non empty RelStr,R being non empty RelStr;
set A = (the carrier of S);
set B = (the carrier of R);
set C = (the InternalRel of S);
set D = (the InternalRel of R);
reconsider C as set;
assume S,R are_isomorphic ;
then consider f being (Function of S,R) such that A1: f is  isomorphic by WAYBEL_1:def 8;
reconsider f9 = f as  one-to-one Function by A1,WAYBEL_0:def 38;
A2: [: f9,f9 :] is  one-to-one;
A3: ( dom f ) = A by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A4: ( rng f ) = B by A1,WAYBEL_0:66;
A5: f is  monotone by A1,WAYBEL_0:def 38;
(the InternalRel of S),(the InternalRel of R) are_equipotent 
proof
set P = [: f,f :];
set F = ( [: f,f :] | C );
set L = ( dom F );
A6: ( dom F ) = ( ( dom [: f,f :] ) /\ C ) by RELAT_1:61
.= ( [: ( dom f ),( dom f ) :] /\ C ) by FUNCT_3:def 8
.= C by A3,XBOOLE_1:28;
A7: ( rng F ) c= D
proof
let a being set;
assume a in ( rng F );
then consider x being set such that A8: x in ( dom F ) and A9: a = ( F . x ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
consider x1 being set,x2 being set such that A10: x = [ x1,x2 ] by A8,RELAT_1:def 1;
B: x in ( dom [: f,f :] ) by A8,RELAT_1:57;
then reconsider X1 = x1,X2 = x2 as (Element of S) by A8,A10,ZFMISC_1:87;
X1 <= X2 by A6,A8,A10,ORDERS_2:def 5;
then A11: ( f . X1 ) <= ( f . X2 ) by A5,ORDERS_3:def 5;
A12: a = ( P . (x1,x2) ) by A8,A9,A10,FUNCT_1:47;
(x1 in ( dom f ) & x2 in ( dom f )) by A3,A8,A10,ZFMISC_1:87,B;
then a = [ ( f . x1 ),( f . x2 ) ] by A12,FUNCT_3:def 8;
hence thesis by A11,ORDERS_2:def 5;
end;
then reconsider F as (Function of L,[: B,B :]) by FUNCT_2:2,XBOOLE_1:1;
reconsider F as (Function of L,D) by A7,FUNCT_2:6;
A13: ( rng F ) = D
proof
thus ( rng F ) c= D by A7;
let x being set;
assume A14: x in D;
then consider x1 being set,x2 being set such that A15: x = [ x1,x2 ] by RELAT_1:def 1;
reconsider x19 = x1,x29 = x2 as (Element of B) by A14,A15,ZFMISC_1:87;
x1 in B by A14,A15,ZFMISC_1:87;
then consider X1 being set such that A16: X1 in ( dom f ) and A17: x1 = ( f . X1 ) by A4,FUNCT_1:def 3;
x2 in B by A14,A15,ZFMISC_1:87;
then consider X2 being set such that A18: X2 in ( dom f ) and A19: x2 = ( f . X2 ) by A4,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider X19 = X1,X29 = X2 as (Element of S) by A16,A18;
x19 <= x29 by A14,A15,ORDERS_2:def 5;
then X19 <= X29 by A1,A17,A19,WAYBEL_0:66;
then A20: [ X1,X2 ] in C by ORDERS_2:def 5;
set Pi = [ X1,X2 ];
Pi in [: ( dom f ),( dom f ) :] by A16,A18,ZFMISC_1:87;
then x = ( [: f,f :] . (X1,X2) ) by A15,A17,A19,FUNCT_3:65
.= ( F . [ X1,X2 ] ) by A6,A20,FUNCT_1:47;
hence thesis by A6,A20,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;
F is  one-to-one by A2,FUNCT_1:52;
hence thesis by A6,A13,WELLORD2:def 4;
end;
hence thesis by CARD_1:5;
