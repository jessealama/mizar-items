theorem
(((for a holds (a in X implies a is T-Sequence)) & X is  c=-linear) implies ( union X ) is T-Sequence)
proof
assume that
A1: (for a holds (a in X implies a is T-Sequence))
and
A2: X is  c=-linear;
( union X ) is  Relation-like  Function-like
proof
thus (a in ( union X ) implies (ex b st (ex c st [ b,c ] = a)))
proof
assume a in ( union X );
then consider x such that A3: a in x and A4: x in X by TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider x as T-Sequence by A1,A4;
(for a holds (a in x implies (ex b st (ex c st [ b,c ] = a)))) by RELAT_1:def 1;
hence thesis by A3;
end;

let a;
let b;
let c;
assume that
A5: [ a,b ] in ( union X )
and
A6: [ a,c ] in ( union X );
consider y such that A7: [ a,c ] in y and A8: y in X by A6,TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider y as T-Sequence by A1,A8;
consider x such that A9: [ a,b ] in x and A10: x in X by A5,TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider x as T-Sequence by A1,A10;
x,y are_c=-comparable  by A2,A10,A8,CKB60:def 1;
then (x c= y or y c= x) by XBOOLE_0:def 9;
hence thesis by A9,A7,FUNCT_1:def 1;
end;
then reconsider F = ( union X ) as Function;
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
($1 in X & (for L holds (L = $1 implies ( dom L ) = $2)));
A11: (for a holds (for b holds (for c holds ((P[ a,b ] & P[ a,c ]) implies b = c))))
proof
let a;
let b;
let c;
assume that
A12: a in X
and
A13: (for L holds (L = a implies ( dom L ) = b))
and
a in X
and
A14: (for L holds (L = a implies ( dom L ) = c));
reconsider a as T-Sequence by A1,A12;
( dom a ) = b by A13;
hence thesis by A14;
end;
consider G such that A15: ([ a,b ] in G iff (a in X & P[ a,b ])) from FUNCT_1:sch 1(A11);
A16: ([ a,b ] in G implies b is Ordinal)
proof
assume A17: [ a,b ] in G;
then a in X by A15;
then reconsider a as T-Sequence by A1;
( dom a ) = b by A15,A17;
hence thesis;
end;
(a in ( rng G ) implies a is Ordinal)
proof
assume a in ( rng G );
then consider b such that A18: (b in ( dom G ) & a = ( G . b )) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
[ b,a ] in G by A18,FUNCT_1:1;
hence thesis by A16;
end;

defpred P[ Ordinal ]
 means
(for B holds (B in ( rng G ) implies B c= $1));
(for B holds (B in ( rng G ) implies B c= A)) by A19,CKB12:def 1;
then A20: (ex A st P[ A ]);
consider A such that A21: (P[ A ] & (for C holds (P[ C ] implies A c= C))) from CKB39:sch 1(A20);
( dom F ) = A
proof
thus (a in ( dom F ) implies a in A)
proof
assume a in ( dom F );
then consider b such that A22: [ a,b ] in F by RELAT_1:def 4;
consider x such that A23: [ a,b ] in x and A24: x in X by A22,TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider x as T-Sequence by A1,A24;
(for L holds (L = x implies ( dom L ) = ( dom x )));
then [ x,( dom x ) ] in G by A15,A24;
then (x in ( dom G ) & ( dom x ) = ( G . x )) by FUNCT_1:1;
then ( dom x ) in ( rng G ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
then A25: ( dom x ) c= A by A21;
a in ( dom x ) by A23,RELAT_1:def 4;
hence thesis by A25;
end;

let a;
assume A26: a in A;
then reconsider a9 = a as Ordinal by CKB24:1;
now
assume A27: (for L holds (L in X implies (not a9 in ( dom L ))));
now
let B;
assume B in ( rng G );
then consider c such that A28: (c in ( dom G ) & B = ( G . c )) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
A29: [ c,B ] in G by A28,FUNCT_1:1;
then c in X by A15;
then reconsider c as T-Sequence by A1;
(c in X & ( dom c ) = B) by A15,A29;
hence B c= a9 by A27,CKB28:1;
end;
then A30: A c= a9 by A21;
a9 c= A by A26,CKB12:def 1;
then A = a by A30,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence contradiction by A26;
end;
then consider L such that A31: (L in X & a in ( dom L ));
(L c= F & (ex b st [ a,b ] in L)) by A31,RELAT_1:def 4,ZFMISC_1:74;
