theorem
Th10: (T is  compact iff ( [#] T ) is  compact)
proof
thus (T is  compact implies ( [#] T ) is  compact)
proof
assume A1: T is  compact;
let F being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A2: F is (Cover of ( [#] T ))
and
A3: F is  open;
consider G being (Subset-Family of T) such that A4: G c= F and A5: G is (Cover of T) and A6: G is  finite by A1,A2,A3,CKB1:def 1;
take G;
thus thesis by A4,A5,A6;
end;

assume A7: ( [#] T ) is  compact;
let F being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A8: F is (Cover of T)
and
A9: F is  open;
consider G being (Subset-Family of T) such that A10: G c= F and A11: G is (Cover of ( [#] T )) and A12: G is  finite by A7,A8,A9,CKB5:def 1;
take G;
thus thesis by A10,A11,A12;
end;
