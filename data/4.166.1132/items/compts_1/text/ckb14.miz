theorem
Th17: ((T is  compact & P is  closed) implies P is  compact)
proof
assume that
A1: T is  compact
and
A2: P is  closed;
reconsider pp = { ( P ` ) } as (Subset-Family of T);
let F being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A3: F is (Cover of P)
and
A4: F is  open;
set FP = ( F \/ pp );
A5: ( P ` ) is  open by A2,TOPS_1:3;
A6: FP is  open
proof
let H being (Subset of T);
assume H in FP;
then (H in F or H in { ( P ` ) }) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence thesis by A4,A5,TARSKI:def 1,TOPS_2:def 1;
end;
reconsider M = { ( P ` ) } as (Subset-Family of T);
( ( F \/ { ( P ` ) } ) \ { ( P ` ) } ) = ( F \ { ( P ` ) } ) by XBOOLE_1:40;
then A7: ( ( F \/ { ( P ` ) } ) \ { ( P ` ) } ) c= F by XBOOLE_1:36;
P c= ( union F ) by A3,SETFAM_1:def 11;
then ( P \/ ( P ` ) ) c= ( ( union F ) \/ ( P ` ) ) by XBOOLE_1:9;
then ( [#] T ) c= ( ( union F ) \/ ( P ` ) ) by PRE_TOPC:2;
then ( [#] T ) = ( ( union F ) \/ ( P ` ) ) by XBOOLE_0:def 10
.= ( ( union F ) \/ ( union { ( P ` ) } ) ) by ZFMISC_1:25
.= ( union ( F \/ { ( P ` ) } ) ) by ZFMISC_1:78;
then FP is (Cover of T) by SETFAM_1:def 11;
then consider G being (Subset-Family of T) such that A8: G c= FP and A9: G is (Cover of T) and A10: G is  finite by A1,A6,CKB1:def 1;
reconsider G9 = ( G \ pp ) as (Subset-Family of T);
take G9;
G9 c= ( ( F \/ { ( P ` ) } ) \ { ( P ` ) } ) by A8,XBOOLE_1:33;
hence G9 c= F by A7,XBOOLE_1:1;
( ( union G ) \ ( union M ) ) = ( ( [#] T ) \ ( union { ( P ` ) } ) ) by A9,SETFAM_1:45
.= ( ( P ` ) ` ) by ZFMISC_1:25
.= P;
then P c= ( union G9 ) by TOPS_2:4;
hence G9 is (Cover of P) by SETFAM_1:def 11;
thus thesis by A10;
