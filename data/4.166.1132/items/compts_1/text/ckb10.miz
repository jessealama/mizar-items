theorem
Th13: (for T being non empty TopSpace holds (T is  compact iff (for F being (Subset-Family of T) holds ((F is  centered & F is  closed) implies ( meet F ) <> ( {} )))))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
thus (T is  compact implies (for F being (Subset-Family of T) holds ((F is  centered & F is  closed) implies ( meet F ) <> ( {} ))))
proof
assume A1: T is  compact;
let F being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A2: F is  centered
and
A3: F is  closed;
reconsider C = ( COMPLEMENT F ) as (Subset-Family of T);
assume A4: ( meet F ) = ( {} );
F <> ( {} ) by A2,FINSET_1:def 3;
then ( union ( COMPLEMENT F ) ) = ( ( meet F ) ` ) by TOPS_2:7
.= ( [#] T ) by A4;
then A5: ( COMPLEMENT F ) is (Cover of T) by SETFAM_1:def 11;
( COMPLEMENT F ) is  open by A3,TOPS_2:9;
then consider G9 being (Subset-Family of T) such that A6: G9 c= C and A7: G9 is (Cover of T) and A8: G9 is  finite by A1,A5,CKB1:def 1;
set F9 = ( COMPLEMENT G9 );
A9: F9 is  finite by A8,TOPS_2:8;
A10: F9 c= F
proof
let X being set;
assume A11: X in F9;
then reconsider X1 = X as (Subset of T);
( X1 ` ) in G9 by A11,SETFAM_1:def 7;
then ( ( X1 ` ) ` ) in F by A6,SETFAM_1:def 7;
hence thesis;
end;
G9 <> ( {} ) by A7,TOPS_2:3;
then A12: F9 <> ( {} ) by TOPS_2:5;
( meet F9 ) = ( ( union G9 ) ` ) by A7,TOPS_2:3,TOPS_2:6
.= ( ( [#] T ) \ ( [#] T ) ) by A7,SETFAM_1:45
.= ( {} ) by XBOOLE_1:37;
hence contradiction by A2,A10,A9,A12,FINSET_1:def 3;
end;

assume A13: (for F being (Subset-Family of T) holds ((F is  centered & F is  closed) implies ( meet F ) <> ( {} )));
thus T is  compact
proof
let F being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A14: F is (Cover of T)
and
A15: F is  open;
reconsider G = ( COMPLEMENT F ) as (Subset-Family of T);
A16: G is  closed by A15,TOPS_2:10;
F <> ( {} ) by A14,TOPS_2:3;
then A17: G <> ( {} ) by TOPS_2:5;
( meet G ) = ( ( union F ) ` ) by A14,TOPS_2:3,TOPS_2:6
.= ( ( [#] T ) \ ( [#] T ) ) by A14,SETFAM_1:45
.= ( {} ) by XBOOLE_1:37;
then (not G is  centered) by A13,A16;
then consider G9 being set such that A18: G9 <> ( {} ) and A19: G9 c= G and A20: G9 is  finite and A21: ( meet G9 ) = ( {} ) by A17,FINSET_1:def 3;
reconsider G9 as (Subset-Family of T) by A19,XBOOLE_1:1;
take F9 = ( COMPLEMENT G9 );
thus F9 c= F
proof
let A being set;
assume A22: A in F9;
then reconsider A1 = A as (Subset of T);
( A1 ` ) in G9 by A22,SETFAM_1:def 7;
then ( ( A1 ` ) ` ) in F by A19,SETFAM_1:def 7;
hence thesis;
end;

( union F9 ) = ( ( meet G9 ) ` ) by A18,TOPS_2:7
.= ( [#] T ) by A21;
hence F9 is (Cover of T) by SETFAM_1:def 11;
thus thesis by A20,TOPS_2:8;
end;
