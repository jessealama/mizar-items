theorem
(for T being non empty TopSpace holds (T is  compact iff (for F being (Subset-Family of T) holds (((F <> ( {} ) & F is  closed) & ( meet F ) = ( {} )) implies (ex G being (Subset-Family of T) st (((G <> ( {} ) & G c= F) & G is  finite) & ( meet G ) = ( {} )))))))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
thus (T is  compact implies (for F being (Subset-Family of T) holds (((F <> ( {} ) & F is  closed) & ( meet F ) = ( {} )) implies (ex G being (Subset-Family of T) st (((G <> ( {} ) & G c= F) & G is  finite) & ( meet G ) = ( {} ))))))
proof
assume A1: T is  compact;
let F being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A2: F <> ( {} )
and
A3: F is  closed
and
A4: ( meet F ) = ( {} );
(not F is  centered) by A1,A3,A4,CKB10:1;
then consider G being set such that A5: G <> ( {} ) and A6: G c= F and A7: G is  finite and A8: ( meet G ) = ( {} ) by A2,FINSET_1:def 3;
reconsider G as (Subset-Family of T) by A6,XBOOLE_1:1;
take G;
thus thesis by A5,A6,A7,A8;
end;

assume A9: (for F being (Subset-Family of T) holds (((F <> ( {} ) & F is  closed) & ( meet F ) = ( {} )) implies (ex G being (Subset-Family of T) st (((G <> ( {} ) & G c= F) & G is  finite) & ( meet G ) = ( {} )))));
(for F being (Subset-Family of T) holds ((F is  centered & F is  closed) implies ( meet F ) <> ( {} )))
proof
let F being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A10: F is  centered
and
A11: F is  closed;
assume A12: ( meet F ) = ( {} );
F <> ( {} ) by A10,FINSET_1:def 3;
then (ex G being (Subset-Family of T) st (((G <> ( {} ) & G c= F) & G is  finite) & ( meet G ) = ( {} ))) by A9,A11,A12;
hence contradiction by A10,FINSET_1:def 3;
end;
hence thesis by CKB10:1;
end;
