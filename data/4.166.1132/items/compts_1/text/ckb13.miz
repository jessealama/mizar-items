reserve TS for TopSpace;
reserve PS for (Subset of TS);
theorem
Th16: ((TS is  T_2 & PS is  compact) implies PS is  closed)
proof
assume that
A1: TS is  T_2
and
A2: PS is  compact;
per cases ;
suppose PS = ( {} );

hence thesis;
end;
suppose A3: PS <> ( {} );

now
let a being set;
thus (a in ( PS ` ) implies (ex Q being (Subset of TS) st ((Q is  open & Q c= ( PS ` )) & a in Q)))
proof
assume A4: a in ( PS ` );
then reconsider p = a as (Point of TS);
consider W being (Subset of TS),V being (Subset of TS) such that A5: W is  open and V is  open and A6: p in W and A7: PS c= V and A8: W misses V by A1,A2,A3,A4,CKB12:1;
take Q = W;
W misses ( ( V ` ) ` ) by A8;
then A9: W c= ( V ` ) by SUBSET_1:24;
( V ` ) c= ( PS ` ) by A7,SUBSET_1:12;
hence thesis by A5,A6,A9,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;

thus ((ex Q being (Subset of TS) st ((Q is  open & Q c= ( PS ` )) & a in Q)) implies a in ( PS ` ));
end;
then ( PS ` ) is  open by TOPS_1:25;
hence thesis by TOPS_1:3;
end;
end;
