definition
let T being non empty TopSpace;
redefine attr T is  regular
means
(for p being (Point of T) holds (for P being (Subset of T) holds (((P <> ( {} ) & P is  closed) & p in ( P ` )) implies (ex W,V being (Subset of T) st ((((W is  open & V is  open) & p in W) & P c= V) & W misses V)))));
compatibility
proof
thus (T is  regular implies (for p being (Point of T) holds (for P being (Subset of T) holds (((P <> ( {} ) & P is  closed) & p in ( P ` )) implies (ex W,V being (Subset of T) st ((((W is  open & V is  open) & p in W) & P c= V) & W misses V)))))) by PRE_TOPC:def 11;
assume A1: (for p being (Point of T) holds (for P being (Subset of T) holds (((P <> ( {} ) & P is  closed) & p in ( P ` )) implies (ex W,V being (Subset of T) st ((((W is  open & V is  open) & p in W) & P c= V) & W misses V)))));
let p being (Point of T);
let P being (Subset of T);
assume that
A2: P is  closed
and
A3: p in ( P ` );
per cases ;
suppose A4: P = ( {} );

take G1 = ( [#] T );
take G2 = ( {} T );
thus (G1 is  open & G2 is  open);
thus p in G1;
thus thesis by A4,XBOOLE_1:65;
end;
suppose P <> ( {} );

hence thesis by A1,A2,A3;
end;
end;
end;
