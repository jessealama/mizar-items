theorem
(for T1,T2 being (SubSpace of T) holds (for f being (Function of T1,S) holds (for g being (Function of T2,S) holds ((((((((( ( [#] T1 ) \/ ( [#] T2 ) ) = ( [#] T ) & ( ( [#] T1 ) /\ ( [#] T2 ) ) = { p }) & T1 is  compact) & T2 is  compact) & T is  T_2) & f is  continuous) & g is  continuous) & ( f . p ) = ( g . p )) implies ( f +* g ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of T,S)))))
proof

proof
