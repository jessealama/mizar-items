theorem
(for T being non empty TopSpace holds (for X being set holds (X is  compact  compact (Subset of T) iff X is  compact  compact (Subset of ( the TopStruct of T )))))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
let X being set;
thus (X is  compact  compact (Subset of T) implies X is  compact  compact (Subset of ( the TopStruct of T )))
proof
assume A1: X is  compact  compact (Subset of T);
then reconsider Z = X as (Subset of ( the TopStruct of T ));
Z is  compact
proof
let F being (Subset-Family of ( the TopStruct of T ));
assume that
A2: F is (Cover of Z)
and
A3: F is  open;
reconsider FF = F as (Subset-Family of T);
FF is  open by A3,CKB43:1;
then consider G being (Subset-Family of ( the TopStruct of T )) such that A4: G c= FF and A5: G is (Cover of X) and A6: G is  finite by A1,A2,CKB5:def 1;
take G;
thus thesis by A4,A5,A6;
end;
hence thesis;
end;

assume A7: X is  compact  compact (Subset of ( the TopStruct of T ));
then reconsider Z = X as (Subset of T);
Z is  compact
proof
let F being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A8: F is (Cover of Z)
and
A9: F is  open;
reconsider FF = F as (Subset-Family of ( the TopStruct of T ));
FF is  open by A9,CKB43:1;
then consider G being (Subset-Family of T) such that A10: G c= FF and A11: G is (Cover of X) and A12: G is  finite by A7,A8,CKB5:def 1;
take G;
thus thesis by A10,A11,A12;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
