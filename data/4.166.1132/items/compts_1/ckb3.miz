let T being non empty TopSpace;
redefine attr T is  normal
means
(for W,V being (Subset of T) holds (((((W <> ( {} ) & V <> ( {} )) & W is  closed) & V is  closed) & W misses V) implies (ex P,Q being (Subset of T) st ((((P is  open & Q is  open) & W c= P) & V c= Q) & P misses Q))));
compatibility
proof
thus (T is  normal implies (for W,V being (Subset of T) holds (((((W <> ( {} ) & V <> ( {} )) & W is  closed) & V is  closed) & W misses V) implies (ex P,Q being (Subset of T) st ((((P is  open & Q is  open) & W c= P) & V c= Q) & P misses Q))))) by PRE_TOPC:def 12;
assume A5: (for W,V being (Subset of T) holds (((((W <> ( {} ) & V <> ( {} )) & W is  closed) & V is  closed) & W misses V) implies (ex P,Q being (Subset of T) st ((((P is  open & Q is  open) & W c= P) & V c= Q) & P misses Q))));
let F1 being (Subset of T),F2 being (Subset of T);
assume that
A6: F1 is  closed
and
A7: F2 is  closed
and
A8: F1 misses F2;
per cases ;
suppose A9: F1 = ( {} );

take G1 = ( {} T );
take G2 = ( [#] T );
thus (G1 is  open & G2 is  open);
thus F1 c= G1 by A9;
thus F2 c= G2;
thus thesis by XBOOLE_1:65;
end;
suppose A10: F2 = ( {} );

take G1 = ( [#] T );
take G2 = ( {} T );
thus (G1 is  open & G2 is  open);
thus F1 c= G1;
thus F2 c= G2 by A10;
thus thesis by XBOOLE_1:65;
end;
suppose (F1 <> ( {} ) & F2 <> ( {} ));

hence thesis by A5,A6,A7,A8;
end;
