(for R,S,T being  complete LATTICE holds (ex f being (Function of ( UPS (R,( UPS (S,T) )) ),( UPS ([: R,S :],T) )) st f is  uncurrying  isomorphic))
proof
deffunc F(Function) = ( uncurry $1 );
let R being  complete LATTICE;
let S being  complete LATTICE;
let T being  complete LATTICE;
consider F being (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of ( UPS (R,( UPS (S,T) )) ))) such that A1: (for f being (Element of ( UPS (R,( UPS (S,T) )) )) holds ( F . f ) = F(f)) from PBOOLE:sch 5;
A2: ( dom F ) = (the carrier of ( UPS (R,( UPS (S,T) )) )) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
A3: ( rng F ) c= (the carrier of ( UPS ([: R,S :],T) ))
proof
let g being set;
assume g in ( rng F );
then consider f being set such that A4: f in ( dom F ) and A5: g = ( F . f ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider f as  directed-sups-preserving (Function of R,( UPS (S,T) )) by A2,A4,CKB36:def 1;
g = ( uncurry f ) by A1,A2,A4,A5;
then g is  directed-sups-preserving  directed-sups-preserving (Function of [: R,S :],T) by CKB65:1;
hence thesis by CKB36:def 1;
end;
then reconsider F as (Function of ( UPS (R,( UPS (S,T) )) ),( UPS ([: R,S :],T) )) by A2,FUNCT_2:2;
take F;
thus A6: F is  uncurrying
