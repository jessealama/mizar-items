theorem
Th46: (for R,S,T being  complete LATTICE holds (for f being  directed-sups-preserving (Function of [: R,S :],T) holds ( curry f ) is  directed-sups-preserving  directed-sups-preserving (Function of R,( UPS (S,T) ))))
proof
let R being  complete LATTICE,S being  complete LATTICE,T being  complete LATTICE;
A1: [: (the carrier of R),(the carrier of S) :] = (the carrier of [: R,S :]) by YELLOW_3:def 2;

then ( curry f ) in ( Funcs ((the carrier of R),( Funcs ((the carrier of S),(the carrier of T)) )) ) by A2,A1,FUNCT_6:10;
then A3: ( curry f ) is (Function of (the carrier of R),( Funcs ((the carrier of S),(the carrier of T)) )) by FUNCT_2:66;
then A4: ( dom ( curry f ) ) = (the carrier of R) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
( rng ( curry f ) ) c= (the carrier of ( UPS (S,T) ))
proof
let y being set;
assume y in ( rng ( curry f ) );
then consider x being set such that A5: x in ( dom ( curry f ) ) and A6: y = ( ( curry f ) . x ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider x as (Element of R) by A3,A5,FUNCT_2:def 1;
( Proj (f,x) ) is  directed-sups-preserving by WAYBEL24:16;
then y is  directed-sups-preserving  directed-sups-preserving (Function of S,T) by A6,WAYBEL24:def 1;

g is  directed-sups-preserving
proof
let A being (Subset of R);

reconsider gsA = ( g . ( sup A ) ) as (Element of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) )) by A7,YELLOW_0:58;

then ( g .: B ) c= (the carrier of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) )) by XBOOLE_1:1;
then reconsider gA = ( g .: A ) as non empty (Subset of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ));
A10: ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ) = ( product ( (the carrier of S) --> T ) ) by YELLOW_1:def 5;
then A11: ( dom gsA ) = (the carrier of S) by WAYBEL_3:27;
A12: ( dom gsA ) = (the carrier of S) by A10,WAYBEL_3:27;
A13:now
let x being set;

then reconsider s = x as (Element of S);
reconsider s1 = { s } as  directed non empty (Subset of S) by WAYBEL_0:5;
reconsider As = [: B,s1 :] as non empty  directed (Subset of [: R,S :]);
A14: f preserves_sup_of As by WAYBEL_0:def 37;
A15:  ex_sup_of As,[: R,S :] by YELLOW_0:17;
( ( (the carrier of S) --> T ) . s ) = T by FUNCOP_1:7;
hence ( ( sup gA ) . x ) = ( sup ( pi (gA,s) ) ) by A9,A10,WAYBEL_3:32
