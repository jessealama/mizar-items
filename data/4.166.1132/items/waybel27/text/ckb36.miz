definition
let S being non empty RelStr;
let T being non empty  reflexive  antisymmetric RelStr;
func UPS (S,T) ->  strict RelStr
means
:Def4: (it is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) )) & (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of it) iff x is  directed-sups-preserving  directed-sups-preserving (Function of S,T))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
$1 is  directed-sups-preserving  directed-sups-preserving (Function of S,T);
consider X being set such that A1: (for a being set holds (a in X iff (a in (the carrier of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) )) & P[ a ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
X c= (the carrier of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ))
proof
let a being set;
assume a in X;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
then reconsider X as (Subset of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ));
take SX = ( subrelstr X );
thus SX is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ));
let f being set;
thus (f in (the carrier of SX) implies f is  directed-sups-preserving  directed-sups-preserving (Function of S,T))
proof
assume f in (the carrier of SX);
then f in X by YELLOW_0:def 15;
hence thesis by A1;
end;

assume A2: f is  directed-sups-preserving  directed-sups-preserving (Function of S,T);
then f is (Element of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) )) by WAYBEL24:19;
then f in X by A1,A2;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:def 15;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let U1 being  strict RelStr,U2 being  strict RelStr;
assume that
A3: U1 is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ))
and
A4: (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of U1) iff x is  directed-sups-preserving  directed-sups-preserving (Function of S,T)))
and
A5: U2 is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ))
and
A6: (for x being set holds (x in (the carrier of U2) iff x is  directed-sups-preserving  directed-sups-preserving (Function of S,T)));
(the carrier of U1) = (the carrier of U2)
proof
hereby
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of U1);
then x is  directed-sups-preserving  directed-sups-preserving (Function of S,T) by A4;
hence x in (the carrier of U2) by A6;
end;
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of U2);
then x is  directed-sups-preserving  directed-sups-preserving (Function of S,T) by A6;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
hence thesis by A3,A5,YELLOW_0:57;
end;
