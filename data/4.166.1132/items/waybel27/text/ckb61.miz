theorem
Th41: (for X being non empty set holds (for S,T being non empty Poset holds (ex F being (Function of ( UPS (S,( T |^ X )) ),( ( UPS (S,T) ) |^ X )) st F is  commuting  isomorphic)))
proof
deffunc F(Function) = ( commute $1 );
let X being non empty set;
let S being non empty Poset,T being non empty Poset;
consider F being (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of ( UPS (S,( T |^ X )) ))) such that A1: (for f being (Element of ( UPS (S,( T |^ X )) )) holds ( F . f ) = F(f)) from PBOOLE:sch 5;
A2: ( dom F ) = (the carrier of ( UPS (S,( T |^ X )) )) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
A3: ( rng F ) c= (the carrier of ( ( UPS (S,T) ) |^ X ))
proof
let g being set;
assume g in ( rng F );
then consider f being set such that A4: f in ( dom F ) and A5: g = ( F . f ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider f as  directed-sups-preserving (Function of S,( T |^ X )) by A2,A4,CKB36:def 1;
g = ( commute f ) by A1,A2,A4,A5;
then reconsider g as (Function of X,(the carrier of ( UPS (S,T) ))) by CKB59:1;
A6: ( rng g ) c= (the carrier of ( UPS (S,T) ));
( dom g ) = X by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then g in ( Funcs (X,(the carrier of ( UPS (S,T) ))) ) by A6,FUNCT_2:def 2;
hence thesis by YELLOW_1:28;
end;
then reconsider F as (Function of ( UPS (S,( T |^ X )) ),( ( UPS (S,T) ) |^ X )) by A2,FUNCT_2:2;
take F;

A8: ( dom G ) = (the carrier of ( ( UPS (S,T) ) |^ X )) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
A9: ( rng G ) c= (the carrier of ( UPS (S,( T |^ X )) ))
proof

(the carrier of ( ( UPS (S,T) ) |^ X )) = ( Funcs (X,(the carrier of ( UPS (S,T) ))) ) by YELLOW_1:28;
then reconsider f as (Function of X,(the carrier of ( UPS (S,T) ))) by A8,A10,FUNCT_2:66;
g = ( commute f ) by A7,A8,A10,A11;
then g is  directed-sups-preserving  directed-sups-preserving (Function of S,( T |^ X )) by CKB60:1;
hence thesis by CKB36:def 1;
end;
then reconsider G as (Function of ( ( UPS (S,T) ) |^ X ),( UPS (S,( T |^ X )) )) by A8,FUNCT_2:2;
A12: G is  commuting
proof
hereby
let x being set;
assume x in ( dom G );
then x in ( Funcs (X,(the carrier of ( UPS (S,T) ))) ) by A8,YELLOW_1:28;
then x is (Function of X,(the carrier of ( UPS (S,T) ))) by FUNCT_2:66;
hence x is  Function-yielding  Function-yielding Function;
end;
thus thesis by A7,A8;

( UPS (S,T) ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( T |^ (the carrier of S) )) by CKB36:def 1;
then A14: ( ( UPS (S,T) ) |^ X ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( ( T |^ (the carrier of S) ) |^ X )) by YELLOW16:39;
A15: ( UPS (S,( T |^ X )) ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( ( T |^ X ) |^ (the carrier of S) )) by CKB36:def 1;
then A16: G is  monotone by A12,A14,CKB33:1;
thus A17: F is  commuting
proof
hereby
let x being set;
assume x in ( dom F );
then x is (Function of S,( T |^ X )) by CKB36:def 1;
hence x is  Function-yielding  Function-yielding Function;
end;
thus thesis by A1,A2;

then A18: F is  monotone by A15,A14,CKB33:1;
(the carrier of ( ( UPS (S,T) ) |^ X )) = ( Funcs (X,(the carrier of ( UPS (S,T) ))) ) by YELLOW_1:28;
then (the carrier of ( ( UPS (S,T) ) |^ X )) c= ( Funcs (X,( Funcs ((the carrier of S),(the carrier of T)) )) ) by CKB39:1,FUNCT_5:56;
