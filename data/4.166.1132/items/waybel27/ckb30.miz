theorem
(for S1,S2,T1,T2 being non empty TopSpace holds ((( the TopStruct of S1 ) = ( the TopStruct of S2 ) & ( the TopStruct of T1 ) = ( the TopStruct of T2 )) implies ( oContMaps (S1,T1) ) = ( oContMaps (S2,T2) )))
proof
let S1 being non empty TopSpace,S2 being non empty TopSpace,T1 being non empty TopSpace,T2 being non empty TopSpace;
assume that
A1: ( the TopStruct of S1 ) = ( the TopStruct of S2 )
and
A2: ( the TopStruct of T1 ) = ( the TopStruct of T2 );
A3: ( oContMaps (S2,T2) ) = ( ContMaps (S2,( Omega T2 )) ) by WAYBEL26:def 1;
( Omega T1 ) = ( Omega T2 ) by A2,WAYBEL25:13;
then reconsider oCM2 = ( oContMaps (S2,T2) ) as  full (SubRelStr of ( ( Omega T1 ) |^ (the carrier of S1) )) by A3,A1,WAYBEL24:def 3;
( oContMaps (S1,T1) ) = ( ContMaps (S1,( Omega T1 )) ) by WAYBEL26:def 1;
then reconsider oCM1 = ( oContMaps (S1,T1) ) as  full (SubRelStr of ( ( Omega T1 ) |^ (the carrier of S1) )) by WAYBEL24:def 3;
(the carrier of oCM1) = (the carrier of oCM2)
proof
thus (the carrier of oCM1) c= (the carrier of oCM2)
proof
let x being set;
A4: ( the TopStruct of ( Omega T2 ) ) = ( the TopStruct of T2 ) by WAYBEL25:def 2;
assume x in (the carrier of oCM1);
then x in (the carrier of ( ContMaps (S1,( Omega T1 )) )) by WAYBEL26:def 1;
then consider f being (Function of S1,( Omega T1 )) such that A5: x = f and A6: f is  continuous by WAYBEL24:def 3;
A7: ( the TopStruct of ( Omega T1 ) ) = ( the TopStruct of T1 ) by WAYBEL25:def 2;
then reconsider f1 = f as (Function of S2,( Omega T2 )) by A4,A1,A2;
(for P1 being (Subset of ( Omega T2 )) holds (P1 is  closed implies ( f1 " P1 ) is  closed))
proof
let P1 being (Subset of ( Omega T2 ));
reconsider P = P1 as (Subset of ( Omega T1 )) by A2,A7,A4;
assume P1 is  closed;
then P is  closed by A2,A7,A4,TOPS_3:79;
then ( f " P ) is  closed by A6,PRE_TOPC:def 6;
hence thesis by A1,TOPS_3:79;
end;
then f1 is  continuous by PRE_TOPC:def 6;
then x in (the carrier of ( ContMaps (S2,( Omega T2 )) )) by A5,WAYBEL24:def 3;
hence thesis by WAYBEL26:def 1;
end;

let x being set;
A8: ( the TopStruct of ( Omega T1 ) ) = ( the TopStruct of T1 ) by WAYBEL25:def 2;
assume x in (the carrier of oCM2);
then x in (the carrier of ( ContMaps (S2,( Omega T2 )) )) by WAYBEL26:def 1;
then consider f being (Function of S2,( Omega T2 )) such that A9: x = f and A10: f is  continuous by WAYBEL24:def 3;
A11: ( the TopStruct of ( Omega T2 ) ) = ( the TopStruct of T2 ) by WAYBEL25:def 2;
then reconsider f1 = f as (Function of S1,( Omega T1 )) by A8,A1,A2;
(for P1 being (Subset of ( Omega T1 )) holds (P1 is  closed implies ( f1 " P1 ) is  closed))
proof
let P1 being (Subset of ( Omega T1 ));
reconsider P = P1 as (Subset of ( Omega T2 )) by A2,A11,A8;
assume P1 is  closed;
then P is  closed by A2,A11,A8,TOPS_3:79;
then ( f " P ) is  closed by A10,PRE_TOPC:def 6;
hence thesis by A1,TOPS_3:79;
end;
then f1 is  continuous by PRE_TOPC:def 6;
then x in (the carrier of ( ContMaps (S1,( Omega T1 )) )) by A9,WAYBEL24:def 3;
hence thesis by WAYBEL26:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:57;
