theorem
Th10: (for f being (SetSequence of Omega) holds ( union ( rng ( disjointify f ) ) ) = ( union ( rng f ) ))
proof
let f being (SetSequence of Omega);
A1: ( dom f ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A2: ( dom ( disjointify f ) ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
now
let x;
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
x in ( f . $1 );
assume x in ( union ( rng f ) );
then consider y such that A3: x in y and A4: y in ( rng f ) by TARSKI:def 4;
consider z such that A5: z in ( dom f ) and A6: y = ( f . z ) by A4,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider n = z as (Element of ( NAT )) by A5,FUNCT_2:def 1;
A7: (ex k being Nat st P[ k ])
proof
take n;
thus thesis by A3,A6;
end;
consider k being Nat such that A8: (P[ k ] & (for m being Nat holds (P[ m ] implies k <= m))) from NAT_1:sch 5(A7);
now
assume x in ( union ( rng ( f | k ) ) );
then consider y such that A9: x in y and A10: y in ( rng ( f | k ) ) by TARSKI:def 4;
consider z such that A11: z in ( dom ( f | k ) ) and A12: y = ( ( f | k ) . z ) by A10,FUNCT_1:def 3;
( dom ( f | k ) ) c= ( NAT ) by A1,RELAT_1:60;
then reconsider n = z as (Element of ( NAT )) by A11;
( dom ( f | k ) ) c= k by RELAT_1:58;
then (n < k & y = ( f . n )) by A11,A12,FUNCT_1:49,NAT_1:44;
hence contradiction by A8,A9;
end;
then x in ( ( f . k ) \ ( union ( rng ( f | k ) ) ) ) by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then A13: x in ( ( disjointify f ) . k ) by CKB13:1;
k in ( NAT ) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
then ( ( disjointify f ) . k ) in ( rng ( disjointify f ) ) by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence x in ( union ( rng ( disjointify f ) ) ) by A13,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
then A14: ( union ( rng f ) ) c= ( union ( rng ( disjointify f ) ) ) by TARSKI:def 3;
now
let x;
assume x in ( union ( rng ( disjointify f ) ) );
then consider y such that A15: x in y and A16: y in ( rng ( disjointify f ) ) by TARSKI:def 4;
consider z such that A17: z in ( dom ( disjointify f ) ) and A18: y = ( ( disjointify f ) . z ) by A16,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider n = z as (Element of ( NAT )) by A17,FUNCT_2:def 1;
A19: (( ( f . n ) \ ( union ( rng ( f | n ) ) ) ) c= ( f . n ) & ( f . n ) in ( rng f )) by A1,FUNCT_1:def 3,XBOOLE_1:36;
x in ( ( f . n ) \ ( union ( rng ( f | n ) ) ) ) by A15,A18,CKB13:1;
hence x in ( union ( rng f ) ) by A19,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
then ( union ( rng ( disjointify f ) ) ) c= ( union ( rng f ) ) by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis by A14,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
