theorem
Th11: (for MS being  segmental non  void 1 -element ManySortedSign holds (for i being (OperSymbol of MS) holds (for A being  non-empty MSAlgebra over MS holds ( Args (i,A) ) = ( ( len ( the_arity_of i ) ) -tuples_on ( the_sort_of A ) ))))
proof
let MS being  segmental non  void 1 -element ManySortedSign;
let i being (OperSymbol of MS);
let A being  non-empty MSAlgebra over MS;
set m = ( len ( the_arity_of i ) );
( dom (the Arity of MS) ) = (the carrier' of MS) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A1: ( Args (i,A) ) = ( ( (the Sorts of A) # ) . ( (the Arity of MS) . i ) ) by FUNCT_1:13
.= ( product ( (the Sorts of A) * ( the_arity_of i ) ) ) by FINSEQ_2:def 5;
A2: ( rng ( the_arity_of i ) ) c= (the carrier of MS) by FINSEQ_1:def 4;
then ( rng ( the_arity_of i ) ) c= ( dom (the Sorts of A) ) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
then A3: ( dom ( (the Sorts of A) * ( the_arity_of i ) ) ) = ( dom ( the_arity_of i ) ) by RELAT_1:27;
A4: (ex n being Nat st ( dom ( the_arity_of i ) ) = ( Seg n )) by FINSEQ_1:def 2;
thus ( Args (i,A) ) c= ( m -tuples_on ( the_sort_of A ) )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( Args (i,A) );
then consider g being Function such that A5: x = g and A6: ( dom g ) = ( dom ( (the Sorts of A) * ( the_arity_of i ) ) ) and A7: (for j being set holds (j in ( dom ( (the Sorts of A) * ( the_arity_of i ) ) ) implies ( g . j ) in ( ( (the Sorts of A) * ( the_arity_of i ) ) . j ))) by A1,CARD_3:def 5;
reconsider p = g as FinSequence by A4,A3,A6,FINSEQ_1:def 2;
( rng p ) c= ( the_sort_of A )
proof
let j being set;
assume j in ( rng p );
then consider u being set such that A8: u in ( dom g ) and A9: ( p . u ) = j by FUNCT_1:def 3;
( ( the_arity_of i ) . u ) in ( rng ( the_arity_of i ) ) by A3,A6,A8,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then A10: ( (the Sorts of A) . ( ( the_arity_of i ) . u ) ) is (Component of (the Sorts of A)) by A2,PBOOLE:139;
( g . u ) in ( ( (the Sorts of A) * ( the_arity_of i ) ) . u ) by A6,A7,A8;
then ( g . u ) in ( (the Sorts of A) . ( ( the_arity_of i ) . u ) ) by A3,A6,A8,FUNCT_1:13;
hence thesis by A9,A10,CKB33:def 1;
end;
then A11: p is (FinSequence of ( the_sort_of A )) by FINSEQ_1:def 4;
( len p ) = m by A3,A6,FINSEQ_3:29;
then x is (Element of ( m -tuples_on ( the_sort_of A ) )) by A5,A11,FINSEQ_2:92;
hence thesis;
end;

let x being set;
assume x in ( m -tuples_on ( the_sort_of A ) );
then x in ( Funcs (( Seg m ),( the_sort_of A )) ) by FINSEQ_2:93;
then consider g being Function such that A12: x = g and A13: ( dom g ) = ( Seg m ) and A14: ( rng g ) c= ( the_sort_of A ) by FUNCT_2:def 2;
A15: ( dom g ) = ( dom ( (the Sorts of A) * ( the_arity_of i ) ) ) by A3,A13,FINSEQ_1:def 3;
now
let x being set;
assume A16: x in ( dom ( (the Sorts of A) * ( the_arity_of i ) ) );
then ( ( the_arity_of i ) . x ) in ( rng ( the_arity_of i ) ) by A3,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then A17: ( (the Sorts of A) . ( ( the_arity_of i ) . x ) ) is (Component of (the Sorts of A)) by A2,PBOOLE:139;
( g . x ) in ( rng g ) by A15,A16,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then ( g . x ) in ( the_sort_of A ) by A14;
then ( g . x ) in ( (the Sorts of A) . ( ( the_arity_of i ) . x ) ) by A17,CKB33:def 1;
hence ( g . x ) in ( ( (the Sorts of A) * ( the_arity_of i ) ) . x ) by A3,A16,FUNCT_1:13;
end;
hence thesis by A1,A12,A15,CARD_3:9;
