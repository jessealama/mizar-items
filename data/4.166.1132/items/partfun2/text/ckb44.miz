reserve X for set;
reserve C for non  empty set;

reserve c for (Element of C);

theorem
(( f | X ) is  constant iff (for c1 holds (for c2 holds ((c1 in ( X /\ ( dom f ) ) & c2 in ( X /\ ( dom f ) )) implies ( f /. c1 ) = ( f /. c2 )))))
proof
thus (( f | X ) is  constant implies (for c1 holds (for c2 holds ((c1 in ( X /\ ( dom f ) ) & c2 in ( X /\ ( dom f ) )) implies ( f /. c1 ) = ( f /. c2 )))))
proof
assume ( f | X ) is  constant;
then consider d such that A1: (for c holds (c in ( X /\ ( dom f ) ) implies ( f /. c ) = d)) by CKB43:1;
let c1;
let c2;
assume that
A2: c1 in ( X /\ ( dom f ) )
and
A3: c2 in ( X /\ ( dom f ) );
( f /. c1 ) = d by A1,A2;
hence thesis by A1,A3;
end;

assume A4: (for c1 holds (for c2 holds ((c1 in ( X /\ ( dom f ) ) & c2 in ( X /\ ( dom f ) )) implies ( f /. c1 ) = ( f /. c2 ))));
now
per cases ;
suppose A5: ( X /\ ( dom f ) ) = ( {} );

now
set d = the (Element of D);
take d;
let c;
thus (c in ( X /\ ( dom f ) ) implies ( f /. c ) = d) by A5;
end;
hence thesis by CKB43:1;
end;
suppose A6: ( X /\ ( dom f ) ) <> ( {} );

set x = the (Element of ( X /\ ( dom f ) ));
x in ( dom f ) by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then reconsider x as (Element of C);
(for c holds (c in ( X /\ ( dom f ) ) implies ( f /. c ) = ( f /. x ))) by A4;
hence thesis by CKB43:1;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
