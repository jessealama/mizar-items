theorem
Th17: (for A being non empty (Subset of U0) holds UAStr (# A,( Opers (U0,A) ) #) is  strict  strict Universal_Algebra)
proof
let A being non empty (Subset of U0);
set C = UAStr (# A,( Opers (U0,A) ) #);
A1: ( dom (the charact of C) ) = ( dom (the charact of U0) ) by CKB12:def 1;
(for n being set holds (n in ( dom (the charact of C) ) implies ( (the charact of C) . n ) is non empty))
proof
let n being set;
assume A2: n in ( dom (the charact of C) );
then reconsider o = ( (the charact of U0) . n ) as (operation of U0) by A1,FUNCT_1:def 3;
( (the charact of C) . n ) = ( o /. A ) by A2,CKB12:def 1;
hence thesis;

(for n being Nat holds (for h being (PartFunc of C) holds ((n in ( dom (the charact of C) ) & h = ( (the charact of C) . n )) implies h is  quasi_total)))
