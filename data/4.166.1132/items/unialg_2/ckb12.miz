reserve U0 for Universal_Algebra;
reserve A for non empty (Subset of U0);
reserve o for (operation of U0);
definition
let U0;
let A;
func Opers (U0,A) -> (PFuncFinSequence of A)
means
:Def7: (( dom it ) = ( dom (the charact of U0) ) & (for n being set holds (for o holds ((n in ( dom it ) & o = ( (the charact of U0) . n )) implies ( it . n ) = ( o /. A )))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ Nat,set ]
 means
(for o holds (o = ( (the charact of U0) . $1 ) implies $2 = ( o /. A )));
A1: (for n being Nat holds (n in ( Seg ( len (the charact of U0) ) ) implies (ex x being (Element of ( PFuncs (( A * ),A) )) st P[ n,x ])))
proof
let n being Nat;
assume n in ( Seg ( len (the charact of U0) ) );
then n in ( dom (the charact of U0) ) by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
then reconsider o1 = ( (the charact of U0) . n ) as (operation of U0) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider x = ( o1 /. A ) as (Element of ( PFuncs (( A * ),A) )) by PARTFUN1:45;
take x;
let o;
assume o = ( (the charact of U0) . n );
hence thesis;

consider p being (FinSequence of ( PFuncs (( A * ),A) )) such that A2: ( dom p ) = ( Seg ( len (the charact of U0) ) ) and A3: (for n being Nat holds (n in ( Seg ( len (the charact of U0) ) ) implies P[ n,( p . n ) ])) from FINSEQ_1:sch 5(A1);
reconsider p as (PFuncFinSequence of A);
take p;
thus ( dom p ) = ( dom (the charact of U0) ) by A2,FINSEQ_1:def 3;
let n being set;
let o;
assume (n in ( dom p ) & o = ( (the charact of U0) . n ));
hence thesis by A2,A3;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let p1 being (PFuncFinSequence of A),p2 being (PFuncFinSequence of A);
assume that
A4: ( dom p1 ) = ( dom (the charact of U0) )
and
A5: (for n being set holds (for o holds ((n in ( dom p1 ) & o = ( (the charact of U0) . n )) implies ( p1 . n ) = ( o /. A ))))
and
A6: ( dom p2 ) = ( dom (the charact of U0) )
and
A7: (for n being set holds (for o holds ((n in ( dom p2 ) & o = ( (the charact of U0) . n )) implies ( p2 . n ) = ( o /. A ))));
(for n being Nat holds (n in ( dom (the charact of U0) ) implies ( p1 . n ) = ( p2 . n )))
proof
let n being Nat;
assume A8: n in ( dom (the charact of U0) );
then reconsider k = ( (the charact of U0) . n ) as (operation of U0) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
( p1 . n ) = ( k /. A ) by A4,A5,A8;
hence thesis by A6,A7,A8;
end;
hence thesis by A4,A6,FINSEQ_1:13;
