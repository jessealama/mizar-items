theorem
Th22: (for L being  algebraic  lower-bounded LATTICE holds (L is  arithmetic iff ( L -waybelow ) is  multiplicative))
proof
let L being  algebraic  lower-bounded LATTICE;
thus (L is  arithmetic implies ( L -waybelow ) is  multiplicative)
proof
assume A1: L is  arithmetic;
now
reconsider C = ( CompactSublatt L ) as  meet-inheriting non  empty  full (SubRelStr of L) by A1,CKB17:def 1;
let a being (Element of L);
let x being (Element of L);
let y being (Element of L);
assume that
A2: [ a,x ] in ( L -waybelow )
and
A3: [ a,y ] in ( L -waybelow );
a << x by A2,WAYBEL_4:def 1;
then consider c being (Element of L) such that A4: c in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) and A5: a <= c and A6: c <= x by CKB13:1;
a << y by A3,WAYBEL_4:def 1;
then consider k being (Element of L) such that A7: k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) and A8: a <= k and A9: k <= y by CKB13:1;
A10: ( c "/\" k ) <= ( x "/\" y ) by A6,A9,YELLOW_3:2;
reconsider c9 = c,k9 = k as (Element of C) by A4,A7;
( c9 "/\" k9 ) in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L ));
then ( c "/\" k ) in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) by YELLOW_0:69;
then ( c "/\" k ) is  compact by CKB1:def 1;
then A11: ( c "/\" k ) << ( c "/\" k ) by WAYBEL_3:def 2;
( a "/\" a ) = a by YELLOW_5:2;
then a <= ( c "/\" k ) by A5,A8,YELLOW_3:2;
then a << ( x "/\" y ) by A10,A11,WAYBEL_3:2;
hence [ a,( x "/\" y ) ] in ( L -waybelow ) by WAYBEL_4:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_7:def 7;
end;

assume A12: ( L -waybelow ) is  multiplicative;
now
let x being (Element of L);
let y being (Element of L);
assume that
A13: x in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L ))
and
A14: y in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L ))
and
 ex_inf_of { x,y },L;
y is  compact by A14,CKB1:def 1;
then y << y by WAYBEL_3:def 2;
then A15: [ y,y ] in ( L -waybelow ) by WAYBEL_4:def 1;
x is  compact by A13,CKB1:def 1;
then x << x by WAYBEL_3:def 2;
then [ x,x ] in ( L -waybelow ) by WAYBEL_4:def 1;
then [ ( x "/\" y ),( x "/\" y ) ] in ( L -waybelow ) by A12,A15,WAYBEL_7:41;
then ( x "/\" y ) << ( x "/\" y ) by WAYBEL_4:def 1;
then ( x "/\" y ) is  compact by WAYBEL_3:def 2;
then ( x "/\" y ) in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) by CKB1:def 1;
hence ( inf { x,y } ) in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) by YELLOW_0:40;
end;
then ( CompactSublatt L ) is  meet-inheriting by YELLOW_0:def 16;
hence thesis by CKB17:def 1;
end;
