theorem
Th29: (for X being set holds (for x,y being (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) holds (x << y iff (for Y being (Subset-Family of X) holds (y c= ( union Y ) implies (ex Z being  finite (Subset of Y) st x c= ( union Z )))))))
proof
let X being set;
let x being (Element of ( BoolePoset X )),y being (Element of ( BoolePoset X ));
( LattPOSet ( BooleLatt X ) ) = RelStr (# (the carrier of ( BooleLatt X )),( LattRel ( BooleLatt X ) ) #) by LATTICE3:def 2;
then A1: (the carrier of ( BoolePoset X )) = (the carrier of ( BooleLatt X )) by YELLOW_1:def 2
.= ( bool X ) by LATTICE3:def 1;
thus (x << y implies (for Y being (Subset-Family of X) holds (y c= ( union Y ) implies (ex Z being  finite (Subset of Y) st x c= ( union Z )))))
proof
assume A2: x << y;
let Y being (Subset-Family of X);
reconsider Y9 = Y as (Subset of ( BoolePoset X )) by A1;
assume y c= ( union Y );
then y c= ( sup Y9 ) by YELLOW_1:21;
then y <= ( sup Y9 ) by YELLOW_1:2;
then consider Z being  finite (Subset of ( BoolePoset X )) such that A3: Z c= Y and A4: x <= ( sup Z ) by A2,WAYBEL_3:18;
reconsider Z9 = Z as  finite (Subset of Y) by A3;
take Z9;
x c= ( sup Z ) by A4,YELLOW_1:2;
hence thesis by YELLOW_1:21;
end;

thus ((for Y being (Subset-Family of X) holds (y c= ( union Y ) implies (ex Z being  finite (Subset of Y) st x c= ( union Z )))) implies x << y)
proof
assume A5: (for Y being (Subset-Family of X) holds (y c= ( union Y ) implies (ex Z being  finite (Subset of Y) st x c= ( union Z ))));
now
let Y being (Subset of ( BoolePoset X ));
reconsider Y9 = Y as (Subset-Family of X) by A1;
assume y <= ( sup Y );
then y c= ( sup Y ) by YELLOW_1:2;
then y c= ( union Y9 ) by YELLOW_1:21;
then consider Z9 being  finite (Subset of Y9) such that A6: x c= ( union Z9 ) by A5;
reconsider Z = Z9 as  finite (Subset of ( BoolePoset X )) by XBOOLE_1:1;
take Z;
thus Z c= Y;
x c= ( sup Z ) by A6,YELLOW_1:21;
hence x <= ( sup Z ) by YELLOW_1:2;
end;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_3:19;
end;
