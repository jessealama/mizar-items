definition
let L being non  empty  reflexive RelStr;
func CompactSublatt L ->  strict  full (SubRelStr of L) means 
:Def1: (for x being (Element of L) holds (x in (the carrier of it) iff x is  compact));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex y being (Element of L) st (y = $1 & y is  compact));
consider X being (Subset of L) such that A1: (for x being set holds (x in X iff (x in (the carrier of L) & P[ x ]))) from SUBSET_1:sch 1;
reconsider S = RelStr (# X,( (the InternalRel of L) |_2 X ) #) as  strict  full (SubRelStr of L) by YELLOW_0:56;
take S;
let x being (Element of L);
thus (x in (the carrier of S) implies x is  compact)
proof
assume x in (the carrier of S);
then (ex y being (Element of L) st (y = x & y is  compact)) by A1;
hence thesis;
end;

thus thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let K1 being  strict  full (SubRelStr of L);
let K2 being  strict  full (SubRelStr of L);
assume that
A2: (for x being (Element of L) holds (x in (the carrier of K1) iff x is  compact))
and
A3: (for x being (Element of L) holds (x in (the carrier of K2) iff x is  compact));
now
let x being set;
thus (x in (the carrier of K1) implies x in (the carrier of K2))
proof
assume A4: x in (the carrier of K1);
(the carrier of K1) c= (the carrier of L) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
then reconsider x9 = x as (Element of L) by A4;
x9 is  compact by A2,A4;
hence thesis by A3;
end;

thus (x in (the carrier of K2) implies x in (the carrier of K1))
proof
assume A5: x in (the carrier of K2);
(the carrier of K2) c= (the carrier of L) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
then reconsider x9 = x as (Element of L) by A5;
x9 is  compact by A3,A5;
hence thesis by A2;
end;

end;
then (the carrier of K1) = (the carrier of K2) by TARSKI:1;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:57;
end;
end;
