theorem
Th30: (for X being set holds (for x being (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) holds (x is  finite iff x is  compact)))
proof
let X being set;
let x being (Element of ( BoolePoset X ));
per cases ;
suppose A1: x is  empty;

then x = ( Bottom ( BoolePoset X ) ) by YELLOW_1:18;
hence thesis by A1,WAYBEL_3:15;
end;
suppose A2: x is non  empty;

thus (x is  finite implies x is  compact)
proof
assume A3: x is  finite;
now
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
$1 in $2;
let Y being (Subset-Family of X);
assume A4: x c= ( union Y );
A5: (for e being set holds (e in x implies (ex u being set st (u in Y & P[ e,u ]))))
proof
let e being set;
assume e in x;
then (ex u being set st (e in u & u in Y)) by A4,TARSKI:def 4;
hence thesis;
end;
consider f being Function such that A6: ( dom f ) = x and A7: ( rng f ) c= Y and A8: (for e being set holds (e in x implies P[ e,( f . e ) ])) from FUNCT_1:sch 5(A5);
reconsider Z = ( rng f ) as (Subset of Y) by A7;
reconsider Z as  finite (Subset of Y) by A3,A6,FINSET_1:8;
take Z;
now
let z being set;
assume z in x;
then (z in ( f . z ) & ( f . z ) in Z) by A6,A8,FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence z in ( union Z ) by TARSKI:def 4;
end;
hence x c= ( union Z ) by TARSKI:def 3;
end;
then x << x by CKB50:1;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_3:def 2;
end;

thus (x is  compact implies x is  finite)
proof
reconsider x9 = x as non  empty set by A2;
set Y = { { y } where y is (Element of x9): (not contradiction) };
Y c= ( bool X )
proof
let t being set;
assume t in Y;
then A9: (ex y9 being (Element of x9) st t = { y9 });
now
let k being set;
assume A10: k in t;
x c= X by CKB49:1;
hence k in X by A9,A10,TARSKI:def 3;
end;
then t c= X by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider Y as (Subset-Family of X);
now
let y being set;
assume y in x;
then A11: { y } in Y;
y in { y } by TARSKI:def 1;
hence y in ( union Y ) by A11,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
then A12: x c= ( union Y ) by TARSKI:def 3;
assume x is  compact;
then x << x by WAYBEL_3:def 2;
then consider Z being  finite (Subset of Y) such that A13: x c= ( union Z ) by A12,CKB50:1;
now
let k being set;
assume k in Z;
then k in Y;
then (ex y9 being (Element of x9) st k = { y9 });
hence k is  finite;
end;
then ( union Z ) is  finite by FINSET_1:7;
hence thesis by A13;
end;

end;
end;
