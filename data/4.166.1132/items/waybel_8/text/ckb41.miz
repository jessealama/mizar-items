theorem
(for L being  algebraic LATTICE holds (L is  arithmetic iff ( CompactSublatt L ) is LATTICE))
proof
let L being  algebraic LATTICE;
thus (L is  arithmetic implies ( CompactSublatt L ) is LATTICE)
proof
set x = the (Element of L);
assume A1: L is  arithmetic;
( compactbelow x ) is non empty by CKB12:def 1;
then consider z being set such that A2: z in ( compactbelow x ) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
(ex z9 being (Element of L) st ((z9 = z & x >= z9) & z9 is  compact)) by A2;
then ( CompactSublatt L ) is non empty  join-inheriting  meet-inheriting  full non empty  join-inheriting  meet-inheriting  full (SubRelStr of L) by A1,CKB1:def 1,CKB17:def 1;
hence thesis;
end;

A6: ( inf { x,y } ) = ( sup X ) by CKB11:def 1;
X is non empty  directed by CKB12:def 1;
then A7:  ex_sup_of X,L by WAYBEL_0:75;

now

then b <= y by CKB7:1;
then A17: b9 <= y9 by YELLOW_0:60;
b9 in ( compactbelow x ) by A15,A16,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then b <= x by CKB7:1;
then b9 <= x9 by YELLOW_0:60;
then b9 <= ( x9 "/\" y9 ) by A8,A17,YELLOW_0:19;
hence b9 <= ( "/\" ({ x,y },L9) ) by A3,YELLOW_0:40;
end;
then A18: X is_<=_than ( "/\" ({ x,y },L9) ) by LATTICE3:def 9;
now
let d being set;
assume d in X;
then (ex d9 being (Element of L) st ((d9 = d & ( inf { x,y } ) >= d9) & d9 is  compact));

then c <= ( x "/\" y ) by A20,YELLOW_0:23;
then c <= ( sup X ) by A6,YELLOW_0:40;
then c = ( sup X ) by A19,ORDERS_2:2;
hence ( inf { x,y } ) in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) by A6;
end;
then ( CompactSublatt L ) is  meet-inheriting by YELLOW_0:def 16;
hence thesis by CKB17:def 1;
