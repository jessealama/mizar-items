theorem
(for A being set holds (for B being non empty set holds (for R being (Relation of A,B) holds (for F being (Subset-Family of A) holds (for G being (Subset-Family of B) holds (G = { ( R .:^ Y ) where Y is (Subset of A): Y in F } implies ( R .:^ ( union F ) ) = ( Intersect G )))))))
proof
let A being set;
let B being non empty set;
let R being (Relation of A,B);
let F being (Subset-Family of A);
let G being (Subset-Family of B);
assume A1: G = { ( R .:^ Y ) where Y is (Subset of A): Y in F };
per cases ;
suppose A2: ( union F ) = ( {} );

then A3: ( R .:^ ( union F ) ) = B by CKB37:1;
per cases ;
suppose A4: G <> ( {} );

G c= { B }
proof
let x being set;
assume x in G;
then consider Y being (Subset of A) such that A5: x = ( R .:^ Y ) and A6: Y in F by A1;
Y = ( {} ) by A2,A6,ORDERS_1:6;
then ( ( .: R ) .: {_{ Y }_} ) = ( {} ) by CKB31:1;
then ( Intersect ( ( .: R ) .: {_{ Y }_} ) ) = B by SETFAM_1:def 9;
hence thesis by A5,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
then ( meet { B } ) c= ( meet G ) by A4,SETFAM_1:6;
then B c= ( meet G ) by SETFAM_1:10;
then ( meet G ) = B by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by A3,SETFAM_1:def 9;
end;
suppose G = ( {} );

hence thesis by A3,SETFAM_1:def 9;
end;
end;
suppose ( union F ) <> ( {} );

then consider Z1 being set such that Z1 <> ( {} ) and A7: Z1 in F by ORDERS_1:6;
reconsider Z1 as (Subset of A) by A7;
A8: G <> ( {} )
proof
assume (not thesis);
then (not ( R .:^ Z1 ) in G);
hence contradiction by A1,A7;
end;
thus ( R .:^ ( union F ) ) c= ( Intersect G )
proof
let a being set;
assume A9: a in ( R .:^ ( union F ) );
(for Y being set holds (Y in G implies a in Y))
proof
let Z2 being set;
assume Z2 in G;
then consider Z3 being (Subset of A) such that A10: Z2 = ( R .:^ Z3 ) and A11: Z3 in F by A1;
reconsider a as (Element of B) by A9;
(for x being set holds (x in Z3 implies a in ( Im (R,x) )))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in Z3;
then x in ( union F ) by A11,TARSKI:def 4;
hence thesis by A9,CKB32:1;
end;
hence thesis by A10,CKB33:1;
end;
then a in ( meet G ) by A8,SETFAM_1:def 1;
hence thesis by A8,SETFAM_1:def 9;
end;

let a being set;
assume A12: a in ( Intersect G );
then A13: a in ( meet G ) by A8,SETFAM_1:def 9;
reconsider a as (Element of B) by A12;
(for X being set holds (X in ( union F ) implies a in ( Im (R,X) )))
proof
let X being set;
assume X in ( union F );
then consider Z being set such that A14: X in Z and A15: Z in F by TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider Z as (Subset of A) by A15;
set C = ( R .:^ Z );
C in G by A1,A15;
then a in C by A13,SETFAM_1:def 1;
hence thesis by A14,CKB32:1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB33:1;
end;
