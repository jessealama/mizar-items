theorem
(for A being set holds (for F being (Subset-Family of A) holds (for R being Relation holds ( R .: ( union F ) ) = ( union { ( R .: X ) where X is (Subset of A): X in F } ))))
proof
let A being set;
let F being (Subset-Family of A);
let R being Relation;
thus ( R .: ( union F ) ) c= ( union { ( R .: f ) where f is (Subset of A): f in F } )
proof
let y being set;
assume y in ( R .: ( union F ) );
then consider x being set such that A1: [ x,y ] in R and A2: x in ( union F ) by RELAT_1:def 13;
consider Y being set such that A3: x in Y and A4: Y in F by A2,TARSKI:def 4;
set Z = ( R .: Y );
A5: y in Z by A1,A3,RELAT_1:def 13;
Z in { ( R .: f ) where f is (Subset of A): f in F } by A4;
hence thesis by A5,TARSKI:def 4;
end;

let y being set;
assume y in ( union { ( R .: f ) where f is (Subset of A): f in F } );
then consider Y being set such that A6: y in Y and A7: Y in { ( R .: f ) where f is (Subset of A): f in F } by TARSKI:def 4;
consider f being (Subset of A) such that A8: Y = ( R .: f ) and A9: f in F by A7;
consider x being set such that A10: [ x,y ] in R and A11: x in f by A6,A8,RELAT_1:def 13;
x in ( union F ) by A9,A11,TARSKI:def 4;
hence thesis by A10,RELAT_1:def 13;
