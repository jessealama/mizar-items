theorem
(for A being non empty set holds (for B being set holds (for X being (Subset of A) holds (for R being (Relation of A,B) holds ( R .: X ) = ( union { ( Class (R,x) ) where x is (Element of A): x in X } )))))
proof
let A being non empty set;
let B being set;
let X being (Subset of A);
let R being (Relation of A,B);
thus ( R .: X ) c= ( union { ( Class (R,x) ) where x is (Element of A): x in X } )
proof
let y being set;
assume y in ( R .: X );
then consider x1 being set such that A1: [ x1,y ] in R and A2: x1 in X by RELAT_1:def 13;
x1 in ( union { { x } where x is (Element of A): x in X } ) by A2,CKB18:1;
then consider S being set such that A3: x1 in S and A4: S in { { x } where x is (Element of A): x in X } by TARSKI:def 4;
consider x being (Element of A) such that A5: S = { x } and A6: x in X by A4;
A7: y in ( R .: { x } ) by A1,A3,A5,RELAT_1:def 13;
set Y = ( R .: { x } );
Y = ( Class (R,x) );
then Y in { ( Class (R,xs) ) where xs is (Element of A): xs in X } by A6;
hence thesis by A7,TARSKI:def 4;
end;

let a being set;
assume a in ( union { ( Class (R,x) ) where x is (Element of A): x in X } );
then consider Y being set such that A8: a in Y and A9: Y in { ( Class (R,x) ) where x is (Element of A): x in X } by TARSKI:def 4;
consider x being (Element of A) such that A10: Y = ( Class (R,x) ) and A11: x in X by A9;
Y c= ( R .: X )
proof
let b being set;
assume b in Y;
then consider x1 being set such that A12: [ x1,b ] in R and A13: x1 in { x } by A10,RELAT_1:def 13;
x1 = x by A13,TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A11,A12,RELAT_1:def 13;
end;
hence thesis by A8;
