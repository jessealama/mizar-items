theorem
Th28: ((for a holds (for b holds (( ( a * u ) + ( b * v ) ) = ( 0. V ) implies (a = ( 0 ) & b = ( 0 ))))) implies ((u <> v & u <> ( 0. V )) & v <> ( 0. V )))
proof
assume A1: (for a holds (for b holds (( ( a * u ) + ( b * v ) ) = ( 0. V ) implies (a = ( 0 ) & b = ( 0 )))));
thus u <> v
proof
assume u = v;
then ( u - v ) = ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:15;
then ( ( 1 * u ) + ( - v ) ) = ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:def 8;
then ( ( 1 * u ) + ( ( - 1 ) * v ) ) = ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:16;
hence contradiction by A1;
end;

thus u <> ( 0. V )
proof
assume u = ( 0. V );
then ( 1 * u ) = ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:10;
then ( ( 1 * u ) + ( 0. V ) ) = ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:4;
then ( ( 1 * u ) + ( ( 0 ) * v ) ) = ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:10;
hence contradiction by A1;
end;

thus v <> ( 0. V )
proof
assume v = ( 0. V );
then ( 1 * v ) = ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:10;
then ( ( 0. V ) + ( 1 * v ) ) = ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:4;
then ( ( ( 0 ) * u ) + ( 1 * v ) ) = ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:10;
hence contradiction by A1;
