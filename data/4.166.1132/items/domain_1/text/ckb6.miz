theorem
Th15: (a in [: X1,X2,X3 :] iff (ex x1 st (ex x2 st (ex x3 st a = [ x1,x2,x3 ]))))
proof
thus (a in [: X1,X2,X3 :] implies (ex x1 st (ex x2 st (ex x3 st a = [ x1,x2,x3 ]))))
proof
assume a in [: X1,X2,X3 :];
then a in [: [: X1,X2 :],X3 :] by ZFMISC_1:def 3;
then consider x12 being set,x3 being set such that A1: x12 in [: X1,X2 :] and A2: x3 in X3 and A3: a = [ x12,x3 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider x3 as (Element of X3) by A2;
consider x1 being set,x2 being set such that A4: x1 in X1 and A5: x2 in X2 and A6: x12 = [ x1,x2 ] by A1,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider x2 as (Element of X2) by A5;
reconsider x1 as (Element of X1) by A4;
a = [ x1,x2,x3 ] by A3,A6,MCART_1:def 3;
hence thesis;
end;

given x1,x2,x3 such that
A7: a = [ x1,x2,x3 ];

a = [ [ x1,x2 ],x3 ] by A7,MCART_1:def 3;
then a in [: [: X1,X2 :],X3 :];
hence thesis by ZFMISC_1:def 3;
end;
