theorem
Th16: ((for a holds (a in D iff (ex x1 st (ex x2 st (ex x3 st a = [ x1,x2,x3 ]))))) implies D = [: X1,X2,X3 :])
proof
assume A1: (for a holds (a in D iff (ex x1 st (ex x2 st (ex x3 st a = [ x1,x2,x3 ])))));
now
let a;
thus (a in D implies a in [: [: X1,X2 :],X3 :])
proof
assume a in D;
then consider x1,x2,x3 such that A2: a = [ x1,x2,x3 ] by A1;
a = [ [ x1,x2 ],x3 ] by A2,MCART_1:def 3;
hence thesis;
end;

assume a in [: [: X1,X2 :],X3 :];
then consider x12,x3 being set such that A3: x12 in [: X1,X2 :] and A4: x3 in X3 and A5: a = [ x12,x3 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider x3 as (Element of X3) by A4;
consider x1,x2 being set such that A6: x1 in X1 and A7: x2 in X2 and A8: x12 = [ x1,x2 ] by A3,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider x2 as (Element of X2) by A7;
reconsider x1 as (Element of X1) by A6;
a = [ x1,x2,x3 ] by A5,A8,MCART_1:def 3;
hence a in D by A1;
end;
then D = [: [: X1,X2 :],X3 :] by TARSKI:1;
hence thesis by ZFMISC_1:def 3;
end;
