theorem
Th31: (a in [: X1,X2,X3,X4 :] iff (ex x1 st (ex x2 st (ex x3 st (ex x4 st a = [ x1,x2,x3,x4 ])))))
proof
thus (a in [: X1,X2,X3,X4 :] implies (ex x1 st (ex x2 st (ex x3 st (ex x4 st a = [ x1,x2,x3,x4 ])))))
proof
assume a in [: X1,X2,X3,X4 :];
then a in [: [: X1,X2,X3 :],X4 :] by ZFMISC_1:def 4;
then consider x123 being set,x4 being set such that A1: x123 in [: X1,X2,X3 :] and A2: x4 in X4 and A3: a = [ x123,x4 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider x4 as (Element of X4) by A2;
consider x1 being (Element of X1),x2 being (Element of X2),x3 being (Element of X3) such that A4: x123 = [ x1,x2,x3 ] by A1,CKB6:1;
a = [ x1,x2,x3,x4 ] by A3,A4,MCART_1:def 4;
hence thesis;
end;

given x1,x2,x3,x4 such that
A5: a = [ x1,x2,x3,x4 ];

a = [ [ x1,x2,x3 ],x4 ] by A5,MCART_1:def 4;
then a in [: [: X1,X2,X3 :],X4 :];
hence thesis by ZFMISC_1:def 4;
end;
