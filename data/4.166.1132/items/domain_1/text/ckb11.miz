reserve b for set;
reserve X1 for non empty set;
reserve X2 for non empty set;
reserve X3 for non empty set;
reserve x1 for (Element of X1);
reserve x2 for (Element of X2);
reserve x3 for (Element of X3);
reserve x for (Element of [: X1,X2,X3 :]);
theorem
(b = ( x `2 ) iff (for x1 holds (for x2 holds (for x3 holds (x = [ x1,x2,x3 ] implies b = x2)))))
proof
thus (b = ( x `2 ) implies (for x1 holds (for x2 holds (for x3 holds (x = [ x1,x2,x3 ] implies b = x2)))))
proof
A1: x = [ ( x `1 ),( x `2 ),( x `3 ) ] by MCART_1:44;
assume A2: b = ( x `2 );
let x1;
let x2;
let x3;
assume x = [ x1,x2,x3 ];
hence thesis by A2,A1,MCART_1:25;
end;

thus thesis by MCART_1:66;
