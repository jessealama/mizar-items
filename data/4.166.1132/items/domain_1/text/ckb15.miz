theorem
Th32: ((for a holds (a in D iff (ex x1 st (ex x2 st (ex x3 st (ex x4 st a = [ x1,x2,x3,x4 ])))))) implies D = [: X1,X2,X3,X4 :])
proof
assume A1: (for a holds (a in D iff (ex x1 st (ex x2 st (ex x3 st (ex x4 st a = [ x1,x2,x3,x4 ]))))));
now
let a;
thus (a in D implies a in [: [: X1,X2,X3 :],X4 :])
proof
assume a in D;
then consider x1,x2,x3,x4 such that A2: a = [ x1,x2,x3,x4 ] by A1;
a = [ [ x1,x2,x3 ],x4 ] by A2,MCART_1:def 4;
hence thesis;
end;

assume a in [: [: X1,X2,X3 :],X4 :];
then consider x123,x4 being set such that A3: x123 in [: X1,X2,X3 :] and A4: x4 in X4 and A5: a = [ x123,x4 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider x4 as (Element of X4) by A4;
consider x1,x2,x3 such that A6: x123 = [ x1,x2,x3 ] by A3,CKB6:1;
a = [ x1,x2,x3,x4 ] by A5,A6,MCART_1:def 4;
hence a in D by A1;
end;
then D = [: [: X1,X2,X3 :],X4 :] by TARSKI:1;
hence thesis by ZFMISC_1:def 4;
