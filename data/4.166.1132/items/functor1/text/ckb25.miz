(for A,B being  transitive  with_units  reflexive non  empty AltCatStr holds (for F being  feasible FunctorStr over A,B holds (F is  bijective implies ( ( F " ) " ) = ( the FunctorStr of F ))))

set CCA = [: (the carrier of A),(the carrier of A) :];
set CCB = [: (the carrier of B),(the carrier of B) :];
