theorem
(for A being non empty AltCatStr holds (for B being non empty (SubCatStr of A) holds (B is  full iff ( incl B ) is  full)))
proof
let A being non empty AltCatStr;
let B being non empty (SubCatStr of A);
hereby
(ex I29 being non empty set st (ex B9 being (ManySortedSet of I29) st (ex f9 being (Function of [: (the carrier of B),(the carrier of B) :],I29) st (((the ObjectMap of ( incl B )) = f9 & (the Arrows of A) = B9) & (the MorphMap of ( incl B )) is (ManySortedFunction of (the Arrows of B),( B9 * f9 )))))) by FUNCTOR0:def 3;
then reconsider f = (the MorphMap of ( incl B )) as (ManySortedFunction of (the Arrows of B),( (the Arrows of A) * (the ObjectMap of ( incl B )) ));

((the carrier of B) c= (the carrier of A) & ( dom (the Arrows of A) ) = [: (the carrier of A),(the carrier of A) :]) by ALTCAT_2:def 11,PARTFUN1:def 2;
then A1: ( ( dom (the Arrows of A) ) /\ I ) = I by XBOOLE_1:28,ZFMISC_1:96;
assume A2: B is  full;
f is  "onto"
proof
let i being set;
assume that
A3: i in I;
(the Arrows of B) = ( (the Arrows of A) || (the carrier of B) ) by A2,ALTCAT_2:def 13;
then A4: ( (the Arrows of B) . i ) = ( (the Arrows of A) . i ) by A3,FUNCT_1:49;

proof
consider f being (ManySortedFunction of (the Arrows of B),( (the Arrows of A) * (the ObjectMap of ( incl B )) )) such that A12: f = (the MorphMap of ( incl B )) and A13: f is  "onto" by A8,FUNCTOR0:def 32;

hence thesis;
