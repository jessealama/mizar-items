theorem
Th9: (for C1 being non  empty AltGraph holds (for C2,C3 being non  empty  reflexive AltGraph holds (for F being  feasible FunctorStr over C1,C2 holds (for G being FunctorStr over C2,C3 holds ((F is  onto & G is  onto) implies ( G * F ) is  onto)))))
proof
let C1 being non  empty AltGraph;
let C2 being non  empty  reflexive AltGraph;
let C3 being non  empty  reflexive AltGraph;
let F being  feasible FunctorStr over C1,C2;
let G being FunctorStr over C2,C3;
assume that
A1: F is  onto
and
A2: G is  onto;
set CC3 = [: (the carrier of C3),(the carrier of C3) :];
set CC2 = [: (the carrier of C2),(the carrier of C2) :];
reconsider OMG = (the ObjectMap of G) as (Function of CC2,CC3);
OMG is  onto by A2,FUNCTOR0:def 7;
then A3: ( rng OMG ) = CC3 by FUNCT_2:def 3;
set CC1 = [: (the carrier of C1),(the carrier of C1) :];
reconsider OMF = (the ObjectMap of F) as (Function of CC1,CC2);
OMF is  onto by A1,FUNCTOR0:def 7;
then ( rng OMF ) = CC2 by FUNCT_2:def 3;
then ( rng ( OMG * OMF ) ) = CC3 by A3,FUNCT_2:14;
then ( OMG * OMF ) is  onto by FUNCT_2:def 3;
hence (the ObjectMap of ( G * F )) is  onto by FUNCTOR0:def 36;
end;
