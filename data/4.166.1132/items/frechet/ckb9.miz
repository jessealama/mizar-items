theorem
Th6: (for T being TopSpace holds (for S being non empty TopStruct holds (for f being (Function of T,S) holds ((for A being (Subset of S) holds (A is  closed iff ( f " A ) is  closed)) implies S is TopSpace))))
proof
let T being TopSpace;
let S being non empty TopStruct;
let f being (Function of T,S);
assume A1: (for A being (Subset of S) holds (A is  closed iff ( f " A ) is  closed));
A2: (for A,B being (Subset of S) holds ((A is  closed & B is  closed) implies ( A \/ B ) is  closed))
proof
let A being (Subset of S),B being (Subset of S);
assume (A is  closed & B is  closed);
then (( f " A ) is  closed & ( f " B ) is  closed) by A1;
then ( ( f " A ) \/ ( f " B ) ) is  closed by TOPS_1:9;
then ( f " ( A \/ B ) ) is  closed by RELAT_1:140;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
(( {} T ) is  closed & ( f " ( {} ) ) = ( {} )) by RELAT_1:136;
then A3: ( {} S ) is  closed by A1;
A4: (for F being (Subset-Family of S) holds (F is  closed implies ( meet F ) is  closed))
proof
let F being (Subset-Family of S);
assume A5: F is  closed;
per cases ;
suppose F = ( {} S );

hence thesis by A3,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
suppose A6: F <> ( {} );

set F1 = { ( f " A ) where A is (Subset of S): A in F };
(ex A being set st A in F)
proof
set A = the (Element of F);
take A;
thus thesis by A6;
end;
then consider A being (Subset of S) such that A7: A in F;
reconsider A as (Subset of S);
A8: ( f " A ) in F1 by A7;
F1 c= ( bool (the carrier of T) )
proof
let B being set;
assume B in F1;
then (ex A being (Subset of S) st (B = ( f " A ) & A in F));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider F1 as (Subset-Family of T);
A9: ( meet F1 ) c= ( f " ( meet F ) )
proof
let x being set;
assume A10: x in ( meet F1 );
(for A being set holds (A in F implies ( f . x ) in A))
proof
let A being set;
assume A11: A in F;
then reconsider A as (Subset of S);
( f " A ) in F1 by A11;
then x in ( f " A ) by A10,SETFAM_1:def 1;
hence thesis by FUNCT_1:def 7;
end;
then A12: ( f . x ) in ( meet F ) by A6,SETFAM_1:def 1;
x in (the carrier of T) by A10;
then x in ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence thesis by A12,FUNCT_1:def 7;
end;
F1 is  closed
proof
let B being (Subset of T);
assume B in F1;
then consider A being (Subset of S) such that A13: ( f " A ) = B and A14: A in F;
A is  closed by A5,A14,TOPS_2:def 2;
hence thesis by A1,A13;
end;
then A15: ( meet F1 ) is  closed by TOPS_2:22;
( f " ( meet F ) ) c= ( meet F1 )
proof
let x being set;
assume A16: x in ( f " ( meet F ) );
then A17: ( f . x ) in ( meet F ) by FUNCT_1:def 7;
A18: x in ( dom f ) by A16,FUNCT_1:def 7;
(for B being set holds (B in F1 implies x in B))
proof
let B being set;
assume B in F1;
then consider A being (Subset of S) such that A19: B = ( f " A ) and A20: A in F;
( f . x ) in A by A17,A20,SETFAM_1:def 1;
hence thesis by A18,A19,FUNCT_1:def 7;
end;
hence thesis by A8,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
then ( meet F1 ) = ( f " ( meet F ) ) by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by A1,A15;
end;
end;
( f " ( [#] S ) ) = ( [#] T ) by TOPS_2:41;
then ( [#] S ) is  closed by A1;
hence thesis by A3,A2,A4,CKB8:1;
end;
