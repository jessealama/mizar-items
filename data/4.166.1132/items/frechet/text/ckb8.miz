theorem
Th5: (for T being TopStruct holds ((((( {} T ) is  closed & ( [#] T ) is  closed) & (for A,B being (Subset of T) holds ((A is  closed & B is  closed) implies ( A \/ B ) is  closed))) & (for F being (Subset-Family of T) holds (F is  closed implies ( meet F ) is  closed))) implies T is TopSpace))
proof
let T being TopStruct;
assume that
A1: ( {} T ) is  closed
and
A2: ( [#] T ) is  closed
and
A3: (for A,B being (Subset of T) holds ((A is  closed & B is  closed) implies ( A \/ B ) is  closed))
and
A4: (for F being (Subset-Family of T) holds (F is  closed implies ( meet F ) is  closed));
A5: (for A,B being (Subset of T) holds ((A in (the topology of T) & B in (the topology of T)) implies ( A /\ B ) in (the topology of T)))
proof
let A being (Subset of T),B being (Subset of T);
assume that
A6: A in (the topology of T)
and
A7: B in (the topology of T);
reconsider A,B as (Subset of T);
B is  open by A7,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then A8: ( ( [#] T ) \ B ) is  closed by CKB6:1;
A is  open by A6,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then ( ( [#] T ) \ A ) is  closed by CKB6:1;
then ( ( ( [#] T ) \ A ) \/ ( ( [#] T ) \ B ) ) is  closed by A3,A8;
then ( ( [#] T ) \ ( A /\ B ) ) is  closed by XBOOLE_1:54;
then ( A /\ B ) is  open by CKB6:1;
hence thesis by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
end;
A9: (for G being (Subset-Family of T) holds (G c= (the topology of T) implies ( union G ) in (the topology of T)))
proof
let G being (Subset-Family of T);
reconsider G9 = G as (Subset-Family of T);
assume A10: G c= (the topology of T);
per cases ;
suppose A11: G = ( {} );

( ( [#] T ) \ ( {} T ) ) = ( [#] T );
then ( {} T ) is  open by A2,CKB6:1;
hence thesis by A11,PRE_TOPC:def 2,ZFMISC_1:2;
end;
suppose A12: G <> ( {} );

reconsider CG = ( COMPLEMENT G ) as (Subset-Family of T);
A13: (for A being (Subset of T) holds (A in G implies ( ( [#] T ) \ A ) is  closed))
proof
let A being (Subset of T);
assume A in G;
then A is  open by A10,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
hence thesis by CKB6:1;
end;
( COMPLEMENT G ) is  closed
proof
let A being (Subset of T);
assume A in ( COMPLEMENT G );
then ( A ` ) in G9 by SETFAM_1:def 7;
then ( ( [#] T ) \ ( A ` ) ) is  closed by A13;
hence thesis by PRE_TOPC:3;
end;
then ( meet CG ) is  closed by A4;
then ( ( union G9 ) ` ) is  closed by A12,TOPS_2:6;
then ( ( [#] T ) \ ( union G ) ) is  closed;
then ( union G ) is  open by CKB6:1;
hence thesis by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
end;
end;
( ( [#] T ) \ ( {} T ) ) is  open by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 3;
then (the carrier of T) in (the topology of T) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
hence thesis by A9,A5,PRE_TOPC:def 1;
end;
