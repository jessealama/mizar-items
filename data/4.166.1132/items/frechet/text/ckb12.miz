Th9: (for S being (sequence of ( R^1 )) holds ((for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( S . n ) in ]. ( n - ( 1 / 4 ) ),( n + ( 1 / 4 ) ) .[) implies ( rng S ) is  closed))
proof
let S being (sequence of ( R^1 ));
reconsider B = ( rng S ) as (Subset of ( R^1 ));
assume A1: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( S . n ) in ]. ( n - ( 1 / 4 ) ),( n + ( 1 / 4 ) ) .[);
(for x being (Point of ( RealSpace )) holds (x in ( B ` ) implies (ex r being  real number st (r > ( 0 ) & ( Ball (x,r) ) c= ( B ` )))))
proof
