existence
proof

A1: ( rng f ) c= ( ( ( REAL ) \ ( NAT ) ) \/ { ( REAL ) } ) by CKB21:1;
( ( REAL ) \/ ( NAT ) ) = ( REAL ) by XBOOLE_1:12;
then ( dom f ) = (the carrier of ( R^1 )) by CKB20:1,TOPMETR:17;

proof
let B being set;

then (ex A being (Subset of X) st (B = ( X \ A ) & (ex fA being (Subset of ( R^1 )) st (fA = ( f " A ) & fA is  closed))));
hence thesis;

reconsider f as (Function of ( R^1 ),T);
A2: (for A being (Subset of T) holds (A is  closed iff ( f " A ) is  closed))
proof
let A being (Subset of T);
thus (A is  closed implies ( f " A ) is  closed)
proof
assume A is  closed;
then ( ( [#] T ) \ A ) is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 3;

hence thesis by PRE_TOPC:def 3;
end;
then reconsider T as  strict non  empty TopSpace by CKB9:1;
take T;
thus (the carrier of T) = ( ( ( REAL ) \ ( NAT ) ) \/ { ( REAL ) } );
reconsider f as (Function of ( R^1 ),T);

A13: (the topology of Y) c= (the topology of X)
proof
let V being set;

reconsider V1 as (Subset of Y);
