theorem
(for A being (Subset of ( R^1 )) holds (A is  open iff (for x being Real holds (x in A implies (ex r being Real st (r > ( 0 ) & ]. ( x - r ),( x + r ) .[ c= A))))))
proof
let A being (Subset of ( R^1 ));
reconsider A1 = A as (Subset of ( RealSpace )) by TOPMETR:12;
thus (A is  open implies (for x being Real holds (x in A implies (ex r being Real st (r > ( 0 ) & ]. ( x - r ),( x + r ) .[ c= A)))))
proof
reconsider A1 = A as (Subset of ( R^1 ));
A1: (the topology of ( R^1 )) = ( Family_open_set ( RealSpace ) ) by TOPMETR:12;
assume A is  open;
then A2: A1 in (the topology of ( R^1 )) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
let x being Real;
reconsider x1 = x as (Element of ( REAL ));
reconsider x1 as (Element of ( RealSpace )) by METRIC_1:def 13;
assume x in A;
then consider r being Real such that A3: r > ( 0 ) and A4: ( Ball (x1,r) ) c= A1 by A2,A1,PCOMPS_1:def 4;
]. ( x - r ),( x + r ) .[ c= A1 by A4,CKB10:1;
hence thesis by A3;
end;

assume A5: (for x being Real holds (x in A implies (ex r being Real st (r > ( 0 ) & ]. ( x - r ),( x + r ) .[ c= A))));
(for x being (Element of ( RealSpace )) holds (x in A1 implies (ex r being Real st (r > ( 0 ) & ( Ball (x,r) ) c= A1))))
proof
let x being (Element of ( RealSpace ));
reconsider x1 = x as Real by METRIC_1:def 13;
assume x in A1;
then consider r being Real such that A6: r > ( 0 ) and A7: ]. ( x1 - r ),( x1 + r ) .[ c= A1 by A5;
( Ball (x,r) ) c= A1 by A7,CKB10:1;
hence thesis by A6;

then A8: A1 in ( Family_open_set ( RealSpace ) ) by PCOMPS_1:def 4;
