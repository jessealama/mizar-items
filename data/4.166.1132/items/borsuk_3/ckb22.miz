theorem
Th14: (for X being non empty TopSpace holds (for Y being  compact non empty TopSpace holds (for G being  open (Subset of [: Y,X :]) holds { x where x is (Point of X): [: ( [#] Y ),{ x } :] c= G } in (the topology of X))))
proof
let X being non empty TopSpace;
let Y being  compact non empty TopSpace;
let G being  open (Subset of [: Y,X :]);
set Q = { x where x is (Point of X): [: ( [#] Y ),{ x } :] c= G };
Q c= (the carrier of X)
proof
let q being set;
assume q in Q;
then (ex x9 being (Point of X) st (q = x9 & [: ( [#] Y ),{ x9 } :] c= G));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider Q as (Subset of X);
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex y being set st (y in Q & (ex S being (Subset of X) st (((S = $1 & S is  open) & y in S) & S c= Q))));
consider RR being set such that A1: (for x being set holds (x in RR iff (x in ( bool Q ) & P[ x ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
RR c= ( bool Q )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in RR;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
then reconsider RR as (Subset-Family of Q);
Q c= ( union RR )
proof
let a being set;
assume a in Q;
then (ex x9 being (Point of X) st (a = x9 & [: ( [#] Y ),{ x9 } :] c= G));
then consider R being  open (Subset of X) such that A2: a in R and A3: R c= Q by CKB21:1;
R in RR by A1,A2,A3;
hence thesis by A2,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
then A4: ( union RR ) = Q by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
( bool Q ) c= ( bool (the carrier of X) ) by ZFMISC_1:67;
then reconsider RR as (Subset-Family of X) by XBOOLE_1:1;
RR c= (the topology of X)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in RR;
then (ex y being set st (y in Q & (ex S being (Subset of X) st (((S = x & S is  open) & y in S) & S c= Q)))) by A1;
