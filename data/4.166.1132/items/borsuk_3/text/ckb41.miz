theorem
(for T1,T2 being TopSpace holds (for S1 being (Subset of T1) holds (for S2 being (Subset of T2) holds ((S1 is  compact & S2 is  compact) implies [: S1,S2 :] is  compact  compact (Subset of [: T1,T2 :])))))
proof
let T1 being TopSpace,T2 being TopSpace;
let S1 being (Subset of T1);
let S2 being (Subset of T2);
assume that
A1: S1 is  compact
and
A2: S2 is  compact;
per cases ;
suppose A3: (S1 is non empty & S2 is non empty);

then ((ex x being set st x in S1) & (ex y being set st y in S2)) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
then reconsider T1,T2 as non empty TopSpace;
reconsider S2 as  compact non empty (Subset of T2) by A2,A3;
reconsider S1 as  compact non empty (Subset of T1) by A1,A3;
reconsider X = [: S1,S2 :] as (Subset of [: T1,T2 :]);
( the TopStruct of [: ( T1 | S1 ),( T2 | S2 ) :] ) = ( the TopStruct of ( [: T1,T2 :] | X ) ) by CKB38:1;
hence thesis by COMPTS_1:3;
end;
suppose (S1 is  empty & S2 is non empty);

then reconsider S1 as  empty (Subset of T1);
[: S1,S2 :] = ( {} [: T1,T2 :] );
hence thesis;
end;
suppose (S1 is non empty & S2 is  empty);

then reconsider S2 as  empty (Subset of T2);
[: S1,S2 :] = ( {} [: T1,T2 :] );
hence thesis;
end;
suppose (S1 is  empty & S2 is  empty);

then reconsider S2 as  empty (Subset of T2);
[: S1,S2 :] = ( {} [: T1,T2 :] );
hence thesis;
end;
end;
