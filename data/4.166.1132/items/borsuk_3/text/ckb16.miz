theorem
Th8: (for X,Y being non empty TopSpace holds (for x being (Point of X) holds (for f being (Function of [: Y,( X | { x } ) :],Y) holds (f = ( pr1 ((the carrier of Y),{ x }) ) implies ( f " ) = <: ( id Y ),( Y --> x ) :>))))
proof
let X being non empty TopSpace,Y being non empty TopSpace;
let x being (Point of X);
let f being (Function of [: Y,( X | { x } ) :],Y);
set Z = { x };
set idZ = ( id Y );
A1: ( rng idZ ) c= (the carrier of Y);
assume A2: f = ( pr1 ((the carrier of Y),Z) );
then A3: ( rng f ) = (the carrier of Y) by FUNCT_3:44;
reconsider Z as non empty (Subset of X);
reconsider idY = ( Y --> x ) as  continuous (Function of Y,( X | Z )) by CKB2:1;
reconsider KA = <: idZ,idY :> as  continuous (Function of Y,[: Y,( X | Z ) :]) by YELLOW12:41;
A4: [: (the carrier of Y),Z :] c= ( rng KA )
proof
let y being set;
assume y in [: (the carrier of Y),Z :];
then consider y1 being set,y2 being set such that A5: y1 in (the carrier of Y) and A6: (y2 in { x } & y = [ y1,y2 ]) by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
A7: y = [ y1,x ] by A6,TARSKI:def 1;
A8: ( idY . y1 ) = ( ( (the carrier of Y) --> x ) . y1 )
.= x by A5,FUNCOP_1:7;
A9: y1 in ( dom KA ) by A5,FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( KA . y1 ) = [ ( idZ . y1 ),( idY . y1 ) ] by FUNCT_3:def 7
.= [ y1,x ] by A5,A8,FUNCT_1:18;
hence thesis by A7,A9,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;
( rng idY ) c= (the carrier of ( X | Z ));
then A10: ( rng idY ) c= Z by PRE_TOPC:8;

then ( f * KA ) = ( id ( rng f ) ) by A2,A3,A10,A1,FUNCT_3:52;
then KA = ( (f qua Function) " ) by A12,A11,FUNCT_1:42;
hence thesis by A12,A13,TOPS_2:def 4;
