theorem
Th9: (for X,Y being non empty TopSpace holds (for x being (Point of X) holds (for f being (Function of [: ( X | { x } ),Y :],Y) holds (f = ( pr2 ({ x },(the carrier of Y)) ) implies ( f " ) = <: ( Y --> x ),( id Y ) :>))))
proof
let X being non empty TopSpace,Y being non empty TopSpace;
let x being (Point of X);
let f being (Function of [: ( X | { x } ),Y :],Y);
set Z = { x };
set idY = ( id Y );
A1: ( rng idY ) c= (the carrier of Y);
assume A2: f = ( pr2 (Z,(the carrier of Y)) );
then A3: ( rng f ) = (the carrier of Y) by FUNCT_3:46;
reconsider Z as non empty (Subset of X);
reconsider idZ = ( Y --> x ) as  continuous (Function of Y,( X | Z )) by CKB2:1;
reconsider KA = <: idZ,idY :> as  continuous (Function of Y,[: ( X | Z ),Y :]) by YELLOW12:41;
A4: [: { x },(the carrier of Y) :] c= ( rng KA )
proof
let y being set;
assume y in [: { x },(the carrier of Y) :];
then consider y1 being set,y2 being set such that A5: y1 in { x } and A6: y2 in (the carrier of Y) and A7: y = [ y1,y2 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
A8: y = [ x,y2 ] by A5,A7,TARSKI:def 1;
A9: ( idZ . y2 ) = ( ( (the carrier of Y) --> x ) . y2 )
.= x by A6,FUNCOP_1:7;
A10: y2 in ( dom KA ) by A6,FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( KA . y2 ) = [ ( idZ . y2 ),( idY . y2 ) ] by FUNCT_3:def 7
.= [ x,y2 ] by A6,A9,FUNCT_1:18;
hence thesis by A8,A10,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;
( rng idZ ) c= (the carrier of ( X | Z ));
then A11: ( rng idZ ) c= Z by PRE_TOPC:8;
then (( rng KA ) c= [: ( rng idZ ),( rng idY ) :] & [: ( rng idZ ),( rng idY ) :] c= [: { x },(the carrier of Y) :]) by FUNCT_3:51,ZFMISC_1:96;
then ( rng KA ) c= [: { x },(the carrier of Y) :] by XBOOLE_1:1;
then A12: ( rng KA ) = [: Z,(the carrier of Y) :] by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10
.= ( dom f ) by A2,FUNCT_3:def 5;
A13: f is  one-to-one by A2,CKB15:1;
A14: f is  onto by A3,FUNCT_2:def 3;
( dom idZ ) = (the carrier of Y) by FUNCT_2:def 1
.= ( dom idY ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( f * KA ) = ( id ( rng f ) ) by A2,A3,A11,A1,FUNCT_3:52;
then KA = ( (f qua Function) " ) by A13,A12,FUNCT_1:42;
hence thesis by A13,A14,TOPS_2:def 4;
