theorem
Th21: (for X,Y being  compact non empty TopSpace holds (for R being (Subset-Family of X) holds (for F being (Subset-Family of [: Y,X :]) holds (((F is (Cover of [: Y,X :]) & F is  open) & R = { Q where Q is  open (Subset of X): (ex FQ being (Subset-Family of [: Y,X :]) st ((FQ c= F & FQ is  finite) & [: ( [#] Y ),Q :] c= ( union FQ ))) }) implies (R is  open & R is (Cover of X))))))
proof
let X being  compact non empty TopSpace,Y being  compact non empty TopSpace;
let R being (Subset-Family of X);
let F being (Subset-Family of [: Y,X :]);
assume that
A1: F is (Cover of [: Y,X :])
and
A2: F is  open
and
A3: R = { Q where Q is  open (Subset of X): (ex FQ being (Subset-Family of [: Y,X :]) st ((FQ c= F & FQ is  finite) & [: ( [#] Y ),Q :] c= ( union FQ ))) };
now
let P being (Subset of X);
assume P in R;
then (ex E being  open (Subset of X) st (E = P & (ex FQ being (Subset-Family of [: Y,X :]) st ((FQ c= F & FQ is  finite) & [: ( [#] Y ),E :] c= ( union FQ ))))) by A3;
hence P is  open;
end;
hence R is  open by TOPS_2:def 1;
A4: ( union F ) = ( [#] [: Y,X :] ) by A1,SETFAM_1:45;
( [#] X ) c= ( union R )
proof
let k being set;
assume k in ( [#] X );
then reconsider k9 = k as (Point of X);
reconsider Z = [: ( [#] Y ),{ k9 } :] as (Subset of [: Y,X :]);
(F is (Cover of Z) & Z is  compact) by A4,CKB28:1,SETFAM_1:def 11;
then consider G being (Subset-Family of [: Y,X :]) such that A5: G c= F and A6: G is (Cover of Z) and A7: G is  finite by A2,COMPTS_1:def 4;
set uR = ( union G );
set Q = { x where x is (Point of X): [: ( [#] Y ),{ x } :] c= uR };
Q c= (the carrier of X)
proof
let k being set;
assume k in Q;
then (ex x1 being (Point of X) st (k = x1 & [: ( [#] Y ),{ x1 } :] c= uR));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider Q as (Subset of X);
Z c= ( union G ) by A6,SETFAM_1:def 11;
then A8: k9 in Q;
A9: (ex FQ being (Subset-Family of [: Y,X :]) st ((FQ c= F & FQ is  finite) & [: ( [#] Y ),Q :] c= ( union FQ )))
proof
take G;
[: ( [#] Y ),Q :] c= ( union G )
proof
let z being set;
assume z in [: ( [#] Y ),Q :];
then consider x1 being set,x2 being set such that A10: x1 in ( [#] Y ) and A11: x2 in Q and A12: z = [ x1,x2 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
consider x29 being (Point of X) such that A13: x29 = x2 and A14: [: ( [#] Y ),{ x29 } :] c= uR by A11;
x2 in { x29 } by A13,TARSKI:def 1;
then z in [: ( [#] Y ),{ x29 } :] by A10,A12,ZFMISC_1:87;
hence thesis by A14;
end;
hence thesis by A5,A7;
end;
uR is  open by A2,A5,TOPS_2:11,TOPS_2:19;
then Q in (the topology of X) by CKB22:1;
then Q is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then Q in R by A3,A9;
hence thesis by A8,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
hence thesis by SETFAM_1:def 11;
