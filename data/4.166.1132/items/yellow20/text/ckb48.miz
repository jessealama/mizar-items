theorem
Th37: (for A,B being non empty AltGraph holds (for F being  Contravariant FunctorStr over A,B holds (F is  surjective implies (for a,b being (object of B) holds (<^ a,b ^> <> ( {} ) implies (for f being (Morphism of a,b) holds (ex c,d being (object of A) st (ex g being (Morphism of c,d) st (((b = ( F . c ) & a = ( F . d )) & <^ c,d ^> <> ( {} )) & f = ( F . g ))))))))))
proof
let A being non empty AltGraph,B being non empty AltGraph;
let F being  Contravariant FunctorStr over A,B;
given f being (ManySortedFunction of (the Arrows of A),( (the Arrows of B) * (the ObjectMap of F) )) such that
A1: (f = (the MorphMap of F) & f is  "onto");

assume A2: ( rng (the ObjectMap of F) ) = [: (the carrier of B),(the carrier of B) :];
let a being (object of B),b being (object of B);
assume that
A3: <^ a,b ^> <> ( {} );
let f being (Morphism of a,b);
(( dom (the ObjectMap of F) ) = [: (the carrier of A),(the carrier of A) :] & [ a,b ] in ( rng (the ObjectMap of F) )) by A2,FUNCT_2:def 1,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
then consider x such that A4: x in [: (the carrier of A),(the carrier of A) :] and A5: [ a,b ] = ( (the ObjectMap of F) . x ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
A6: ( dom (the ObjectMap of F) ) = [: (the carrier of A),(the carrier of A) :] by FUNCT_2:def 1;
(the ObjectMap of F) is  Contravariant by FUNCTOR0:def 13;
then consider g being (Function of (the carrier of A),(the carrier of B)) such that A7: (the ObjectMap of F) = ( ~ [: g,g :] ) by FUNCTOR0:def 2;
consider d being set,c being set such that A8: (d in (the carrier of A) & c in (the carrier of A)) and A9: [ d,c ] = x by A4,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider c,d as (object of A) by A8;
[ c,c ] in [: (the carrier of A),(the carrier of A) :] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
then ( (the ObjectMap of F) . (c,c) ) = ( [: g,g :] . (c,c) ) by A7,A6,FUNCT_4:43;
then ( (the ObjectMap of F) . (c,c) ) = [ ( g . c ),( g . c ) ] by FUNCT_3:75;
then A10: ( F . c ) = ( g . c ) by MCART_1:7;
[ d,d ] in [: (the carrier of A),(the carrier of A) :] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
then ( (the ObjectMap of F) . (d,d) ) = ( [: g,g :] . (d,d) ) by A7,A6,FUNCT_4:43;
then ( (the ObjectMap of F) . (d,d) ) = [ ( g . d ),( g . d ) ] by FUNCT_3:75;
then A11: ( F . d ) = ( g . d ) by MCART_1:7;
[ d,c ] in [: (the carrier of A),(the carrier of A) :] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
then A12: ( (the ObjectMap of F) . (d,c) ) = ( [: g,g :] . (c,d) ) by A7,A6,FUNCT_4:43
.= [ ( F . c ),( F . d ) ] by A10,A11,FUNCT_3:75;
( rng ( Morph-Map (F,d,c) ) ) = ( ( (the Arrows of B) * (the ObjectMap of F) ) . [ d,c ] ) by A1,A4,A9,MSUALG_3:def 3
.= <^ a,b ^> by A4,A5,A9,FUNCT_2:15;
then consider g being set such that A13: g in ( dom ( Morph-Map (F,d,c) ) ) and A14: f = ( ( Morph-Map (F,d,c) ) . g ) by A3,FUNCT_1:def 3;
take d;
take c;
reconsider g as (Morphism of d,c) by A13;
take g;
thus ((b = ( F . d ) & a = ( F . c )) & <^ d,c ^> <> ( {} )) by A5,A9,A12,A13,ZFMISC_1:27;
thus thesis by A3,A5,A9,A12,A13,A14,FUNCTOR0:def 16;
