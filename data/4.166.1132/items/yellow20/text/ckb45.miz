theorem
Th34: (for A,B being non empty AltGraph holds (for F being  Covariant FunctorStr over A,B holds (F is  surjective implies (for a,b being (object of B) holds (<^ a,b ^> <> ( {} ) implies (for f being (Morphism of a,b) holds (ex c,d being (object of A) st (ex g being (Morphism of c,d) st (((a = ( F . c ) & b = ( F . d )) & <^ c,d ^> <> ( {} )) & f = ( F . g ))))))))))
proof
let A being non empty AltGraph,B being non empty AltGraph;
let F being  Covariant FunctorStr over A,B;
given f being (ManySortedFunction of (the Arrows of A),( (the Arrows of B) * (the ObjectMap of F) )) such that
A1: (f = (the MorphMap of F) & f is  "onto");

assume A2: ( rng (the ObjectMap of F) ) = [: (the carrier of B),(the carrier of B) :];
let a being (object of B),b being (object of B);
assume that
A3: <^ a,b ^> <> ( {} );
(the ObjectMap of F) is  Covariant by FUNCTOR0:def 12;
then consider g being (Function of (the carrier of A),(the carrier of B)) such that A4: (the ObjectMap of F) = [: g,g :] by FUNCTOR0:def 1;
let f being (Morphism of a,b);
(( dom (the ObjectMap of F) ) = [: (the carrier of A),(the carrier of A) :] & [ a,b ] in ( rng (the ObjectMap of F) )) by A2,FUNCT_2:def 1,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
then consider x such that A5: x in [: (the carrier of A),(the carrier of A) :] and A6: [ a,b ] = ( (the ObjectMap of F) . x ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
consider c being set,d being set such that A7: (c in (the carrier of A) & d in (the carrier of A)) and A8: [ c,d ] = x by A5,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider c,d as (object of A) by A7;
( (the ObjectMap of F) . (d,d) ) = [ ( g . d ),( g . d ) ] by A4,FUNCT_3:75;
then A9: ( F . d ) = ( g . d ) by MCART_1:7;
( (the ObjectMap of F) . (c,c) ) = [ ( g . c ),( g . c ) ] by A4,FUNCT_3:75;
then ( F . c ) = ( g . c ) by MCART_1:7;
then A10: ( (the ObjectMap of F) . (c,d) ) = [ ( F . c ),( F . d ) ] by A4,A9,FUNCT_3:75;
( rng ( Morph-Map (F,c,d) ) ) = ( ( (the Arrows of B) * (the ObjectMap of F) ) . [ c,d ] ) by A1,A5,A8,MSUALG_3:def 3
.= <^ a,b ^> by A5,A6,A8,FUNCT_2:15;
then consider g being set such that A11: g in ( dom ( Morph-Map (F,c,d) ) ) and A12: f = ( ( Morph-Map (F,c,d) ) . g ) by A3,FUNCT_1:def 3;
take c;
take d;
reconsider g as (Morphism of c,d) by A11;
take g;
thus ((a = ( F . c ) & b = ( F . d )) & <^ c,d ^> <> ( {} )) by A6,A8,A10,A11,ZFMISC_1:27;
thus thesis by A3,A6,A8,A10,A11,A12,FUNCTOR0:def 15;
