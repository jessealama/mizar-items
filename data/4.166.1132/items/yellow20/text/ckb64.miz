theorem
(for A1,A2 being category holds (for F being  covariant (Functor of A1,A2) holds (F is  bijective implies (for B1 being non empty (subcategory of A1) holds (for B2 being non empty (subcategory of A2) holds (B1,B2 are_isomorphic_under F implies B2,B1 are_isomorphic_under ( F " )))))))
proof
let A1 being category,A2 being category;
let F being  covariant (Functor of A1,A2);
assume that
A1: F is  bijective;
F is  surjective by A1,FUNCTOR0:def 35;
then F is  onto by FUNCTOR0:def 34;
then A2: F is  coreflexive by FUNCTOR0:46;
(ex H being (Functor of A2,A1) st (H = ( F " ) & H is  bijective  covariant)) by A1,FUNCTOR0:48;
then reconsider F9 = ( F " ) as  covariant (Functor of A2,A1);
let B1 being non empty (subcategory of A1);
let B2 being non empty (subcategory of A2);
assume that
B1 is (subcategory of A1)
and
B2 is (subcategory of A2);
given G being  covariant (Functor of B1,B2) such that
A3: G is  bijective
and
A4: (for a being (object of B1) holds (for a1 being (object of A1) holds (a = a1 implies ( G . a ) = ( F . a1 ))))
and
A5: (for b,c being (object of B1) holds (for b1,c1 being (object of A1) holds (((<^ b,c ^> <> ( {} ) & b = b1) & c = c1) implies (for f being (Morphism of b,c) holds (for f1 being (Morphism of b1,c1) holds (f = f1 implies ( G . f ) = ( ( Morph-Map (F,b1,c1) ) . f1 )))))));

G is  surjective by A3,FUNCTOR0:def 35;
then G is  onto by FUNCTOR0:def 34;
then A6: G is  coreflexive by FUNCTOR0:46;
thus (B2 is (subcategory of A2) & B1 is (subcategory of A1));
consider H being (Functor of B2,B1) such that A7: H = ( G " ) and A8: H is  bijective  covariant by A3,FUNCTOR0:48;
reconsider H as  covariant (Functor of B2,B1) by A8;
take H;
thus H is  bijective by A8;
A9: (the carrier of B1) c= (the carrier of A1) by ALTCAT_2:def 11;
thus A10:now
let a being (object of B2);
let a1 being (object of A2);
( H . a ) in (the carrier of B1);
then reconsider Ha = ( H . a ) as (object of A1) by A9;
( G . ( H . a ) ) = ( F . Ha ) by A4;
then A11: ( F . Ha ) = a by A3,A7,A6,CKB1:1;
assume a = a1;
hence ( H . a ) = ( ( F " ) . a1 ) by A1,A2,A11,CKB1:1;

let f1 being (Morphism of b1,c1);
assume that

A20: (( H . b ) = ( ( F " ) . b1 ) & ( H . c ) = ( ( F " ) . c1 )) by A10,A13;
then A21: <^ ( H . b ),( H . c ) ^> c= <^ ( ( F " ) . b1 ),( ( F " ) . c1 ) ^> by ALTCAT_2:31;
then reconsider Hf = ( H . f ) as (Morphism of ( ( F " ) . b1 ),( ( F " ) . c1 )) by A18;
( G . ( H . f ) ) = ( ( Morph-Map (F,( ( F " ) . b1 ),( ( F " ) . c1 )) ) . Hf ) by A5,A20,A17

then ( F . Hf ) = f by A3,A7,A17,A16,CKB2:1;
