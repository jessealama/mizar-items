theorem
(for h being  one-to-one Function holds ( ( h | X ) " ) = ( ( h " ) | ( h .: X ) ))
proof
let h being  one-to-one Function;
reconsider hX = ( h | X ) as  one-to-one Function;
now
let r being set;
thus (r in ( dom ( ( h | X ) " ) ) implies r in ( dom ( ( h " ) | ( h .: X ) ) ))
proof
assume r in ( dom ( ( h | X ) " ) );
then r in ( rng hX ) by FUNCT_1:33;
then consider g being set such that A1: g in ( dom ( h | X ) ) and A2: ( ( h | X ) . g ) = r by FUNCT_1:def 3;
A3: ( h . g ) = r by A1,A2,FUNCT_1:47;
A4: g in ( ( dom h ) /\ X ) by A1,RELAT_1:61;
then g in ( dom h ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then r in ( rng h ) by A3,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then A5: r in ( dom ( h " ) ) by FUNCT_1:33;
(g in ( dom h ) & g in X) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then r in ( h .: X ) by A3,FUNCT_1:def 6;
then r in ( ( dom ( h " ) ) /\ ( h .: X ) ) by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by RELAT_1:61;
end;

assume r in ( dom ( ( h " ) | ( h .: X ) ) );
then r in ( ( dom ( h " ) ) /\ ( h .: X ) ) by RELAT_1:61;
then r in ( h .: X ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider t being set such that A6: t in ( dom h ) and A7: t in X and A8: ( h . t ) = r by FUNCT_1:def 6;
t in ( ( dom h ) /\ X ) by A6,A7,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A9: t in ( dom ( h | X ) ) by RELAT_1:61;
( ( h | X ) . t ) = r by A7,A8,FUNCT_1:49;
then r in ( rng hX ) by A9,FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence r in ( dom ( ( h | X ) " ) ) by FUNCT_1:33;
end;
then A10: ( dom ( hX " ) ) = ( dom ( ( h " ) | ( h .: X ) ) ) by TARSKI:1;
now
given r being set such that
A11: r in ( dom ( ( h | X ) " ) )
and
A12: ( ( ( h | X ) " ) . r ) <> ( ( ( h " ) | ( h .: X ) ) . r );

r in ( ( dom ( h " ) ) /\ ( h .: X ) ) by A10,A11,RELAT_1:61;
then r in ( h .: X ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider t being set such that t in ( dom h ) and t in X and A13: ( h . t ) = r by FUNCT_1:def 6;
r in ( rng hX ) by A11,FUNCT_1:33;
then consider g being set such that A14: g in ( dom ( h | X ) ) and A15: ( ( h | X ) . g ) = r by FUNCT_1:def 3;
A16: ( h . g ) = r by A14,A15,FUNCT_1:47;
g in ( ( dom h ) /\ X ) by A14,RELAT_1:61;
then A17: g in ( dom h ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
( ( hX " ) . r ) <> ( ( h " ) . r ) by A10,A11,A12,FUNCT_1:47;
then g <> ( ( h " ) . ( h . t ) ) by A14,A15,A13,FUNCT_1:34;
hence contradiction by A13,A17,A16,FUNCT_1:34;
end;
hence thesis by A10,FUNCT_1:2;
