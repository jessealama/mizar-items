S2 is  c=-linear
proof
let y1 being set;
let y2 being set;
assume that
A123: y1 in S2
and
A124: y2 in S2;
(y1 in S or y1 in { xm2 }) by A123,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then A125: (y1 in S or y1 = xm2) by TARSKI:def 1;
(y2 in S or y2 in { xm2 }) by A124,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then (y2 in S or y2 = xm2) by TARSKI:def 1;
