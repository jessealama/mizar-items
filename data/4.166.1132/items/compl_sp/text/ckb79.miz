theorem
Th42: (for M being  symmetric  triangle  Reflexive non  empty MetrStruct holds (for a being (Point of M) holds (M is  complete implies ( WellSpace (a,X) ) is  complete)))
proof
let M being  symmetric  triangle  Reflexive non  empty MetrStruct;
let a being (Point of M);
set W = ( WellSpace (a,X) );
reconsider Xa = [ X,a ] as (Point of W) by CKB67:1;
assume A1: M is  complete;
let S9 being (sequence of W);
assume that
A2: S9 is  Cauchy;
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(ex x st ( S9 . $1 ) = [ x,$2 ]);
A3: (for x holds (x in ( NAT ) implies (ex y st (y in (the carrier of M) & P[ x,y ]))))
proof
let x;
assume x in ( NAT );
then reconsider i = x as (Element of ( NAT ));
consider s1 being set,s2 being (Point of M) such that A4: ( S9 . i ) = [ s1,s2 ] and ((s1 in X & s2 <> a) or (s1 = X & s2 = a)) by CKB67:1;
