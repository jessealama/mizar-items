theorem
Th22: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (T is  countably_compact iff (for S being  non-empty  closed (SetSequence of T) holds (S is  non-ascending implies ( meet S ) <> ( {} )))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
thus (T is  countably_compact implies (for S being  non-empty  closed (SetSequence of T) holds (S is  non-ascending implies ( meet S ) <> ( {} ))))
proof
assume A1: T is  countably_compact;
let S being  non-empty  closed (SetSequence of T);
assume that
A2: S is  non-ascending;
reconsider rngS = ( rng S ) as (Subset-Family of T);
( dom S ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A3: rngS is  countable by CARD_3:93;
now
let D being (Subset of T);
assume D in rngS;
then (ex x st (x in ( dom S ) & ( S . x ) = D)) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence D is  closed by CKB17:def 1;
end;
then A4: rngS is  closed by TOPS_2:def 2;
rngS is  centered by A2,CKB31:1;
then ( meet rngS ) <> ( {} ) by A1,A3,A4,CKB42:1;
then consider x such that A5: x in ( meet rngS ) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
now
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
( dom S ) = ( NAT ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( S . n ) in rngS by FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence x in ( S . n ) by A5,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by KURATO_0:3;
end;

assume A6: (for S being  non-empty  closed (SetSequence of T) holds (S is  non-ascending implies ( meet S ) <> ( {} )));
now
let F being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A7: F is  centered
and
A8: F is  closed
and
A9: F is  countable;
A10: ( card F ) c= ( omega ) by A9,CARD_3:def 14;
now
per cases  by A10,CARD_1:3;
suppose ( card F ) = ( omega );

then ( NAT ),F are_equipotent  by CARD_1:5,CARD_1:47;
then consider s being Function such that s is  one-to-one and A11: ( dom s ) = ( NAT ) and A12: ( rng s ) = F by WELLORD2:def 4;
reconsider s as (SetSequence of T) by A11,A12,FUNCT_2:2;
consider R being (SetSequence of T) such that A13: R is  non-ascending and A14: (F is  centered implies R is  non-empty) and (F is  open implies R is  open) and A15: (F is  closed implies R is  closed) and A16: (for i holds ( R . i ) = ( meet { ( s . j ) where j is (Element of ( NAT )): j <= i } )) by A12,CKB33:1;
( meet R ) <> ( {} ) by A6,A7,A8,A13,A14,A15;
then consider x such that A17: x in ( meet R ) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
A18:now
let y;
assume y in F;
then consider z being set such that A19: z in ( dom s ) and A20: ( s . z ) = y by A12,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider z as (Element of ( NAT )) by A19;
A21: ( s . z ) in { ( s . j ) where j is (Element of ( NAT )): j <= z };
A22: x in ( R . z ) by A17,KURATO_0:3;
( R . z ) = ( meet { ( s . j ) where j is (Element of ( NAT )): j <= z } ) by A16;
then ( R . z ) c= ( s . z ) by A21,SETFAM_1:3;
hence x in y by A20,A22;
end;
F is non  empty by A11,A12,RELAT_1:42;
hence ( meet F ) is non  empty by A18,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
suppose A23: ( card F ) in ( omega );

A24: F <> ( {} ) by A7,FINSET_1:def 3;
F is  finite by A23;
hence ( meet F ) is non  empty by A7,A24,FINSET_1:def 3;
end;
end;
hence ( meet F ) <> ( {} );
end;
hence thesis by CKB42:1;
