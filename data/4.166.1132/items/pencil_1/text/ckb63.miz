proof
let k being (Block of ( Segre_Product A )),l being (Block of ( Segre_Product A ));
assume 2 c= ( card ( k /\ l ) );
then consider a being set,b being set such that A2: a in ( k /\ l ) and A3: b in ( k /\ l ) and A4: a <> b by CKB2:1;

then (not ( B . i ) is 1 -element) by CKB4:1;
then i1 = i by A13;
hence thesis by A12,A13;
