let I being non  empty set;

:Def22: (for x being set holds (x in it iff (ex B being  Segre-like (ManySortedSubset of ( Carrier A )) st (x = ( product B ) & (ex i being (Element of I) st ( B . i ) is (Block of ( A . i )))))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex B being  Segre-like (ManySortedSubset of ( Carrier A )) st ($1 = ( product B ) & (ex i being (Element of I) st ( B . i ) is (Block of ( A . i )))));
consider S being set such that A1: (for x being set holds (x in S iff (x in ( bool ( product ( Carrier A ) ) ) & P[ x ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
S c= ( bool ( product ( Carrier A ) ) )
proof
let a being set;
assume a in S;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
then reconsider S as (Subset-Family of ( product ( Carrier A ) ));
take S;
let x being set;
thus (x in S implies (ex B being  Segre-like (ManySortedSubset of ( Carrier A )) st (x = ( product B ) & (ex i being (Element of I) st ( B . i ) is (Block of ( A . i )))))) by A1;
given B being  Segre-like (ManySortedSubset of ( Carrier A )) such that
A2: x = ( product B )
and
A3: (ex i being (Element of I) st ( B . i ) is (Block of ( A . i )));

x c= ( product ( Carrier A ) )
proof
let a being set;
assume a in x;
then consider g being Function such that A4: g = a and A5: ( dom g ) = ( dom B ) and A6: (for y being set holds (y in ( dom B ) implies ( g . y ) in ( B . y ))) by A2,CARD_3:def 5;
A7: (for y being set holds (y in ( dom ( Carrier A ) ) implies ( g . y ) in ( ( Carrier A ) . y )))
proof
let y being set;
assume y in ( dom ( Carrier A ) );
then A8: y in I by PARTFUN1:def 2;
then y in ( dom g ) by A5,PARTFUN1:def 2;
then A9: ( g . y ) in ( B . y ) by A5,A6;
B c= ( Carrier A ) by PBOOLE:def 18;
then ( B . y ) c= ( ( Carrier A ) . y ) by A8,PBOOLE:def 2;
hence thesis by A9;
end;
( dom g ) = I by A5,PARTFUN1:def 2
.= ( dom ( Carrier A ) ) by PARTFUN1:def 2;
hence thesis by A4,A7,CARD_3:def 5;

hence thesis by A1,A2,A3;

uniqueness
proof
let S1 being (Subset-Family of ( product ( Carrier A ) ));
let S2 being (Subset-Family of ( product ( Carrier A ) ));
assume that

(for x being set holds (x in S1 iff x in S2))
proof
let x being set;
(x in S1 iff (ex B being  Segre-like (ManySortedSubset of ( Carrier A )) st (x = ( product B ) & (ex i being (Element of I) st ( B . i ) is (Block of ( A . i )))))) by A10;
