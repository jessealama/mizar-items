theorem
Th6: (a in C iff (for x holds (for y holds ((x in a & y in a) implies { x,y } in C))))
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
{ $1 } = $2;
thus (a in C implies (for x holds (for y holds ((x in a & y in a) implies { x,y } in C))))
proof
assume A1: a in C;
let x;
let y;
assume (x in a & y in a);
then { x,y } c= a by ZFMISC_1:32;
hence thesis by A1,CLASSES1:def 1;
end;

A2: (for x holds (for y holds (for z holds ((P[ x,y ] & P[ x,z ]) implies y = z))));
consider X such that A3: (for x holds (x in X iff (ex y st (y in a & P[ y,x ])))) from TARSKI:sch 1(A2);
assume A4: (for x holds (for y holds ((x in a & y in a) implies { x,y } in C)));
A5: (for b holds (for c holds ((b in X & c in X) implies ( b \/ c ) in C)))
proof
let b;
let c;
assume that
A6: b in X
and
A7: c in X;
consider z such that A8: z in a and A9: { z } = c by A3,A7;
consider y such that A10: y in a and A11: { y } = b by A3,A6;
{ y,z } in C by A4,A10,A8;
hence thesis by A11,A9,ENUMSET1:1;
end;
A12: ( union X ) = a
proof
thus ( union X ) c= a
proof
let x;
assume x in ( union X );
then consider Z being set such that A13: x in Z and A14: Z in X by TARSKI:def 4;
(ex y st (y in a & Z = { y })) by A3,A14;
hence thesis by A13,TARSKI:def 1;
end;

let x;
assume x in a;
then A15: { x } in X by A3;
x in { x } by TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A15,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
X c= C
proof
let x;
assume x in X;
then consider y such that A16: y in a and A17: { y } = x by A3;
{ y,y } in C by A4,A16;
hence thesis by A17,ENUMSET1:29;
end;
hence thesis by A5,A12,CKB1:def 1;
