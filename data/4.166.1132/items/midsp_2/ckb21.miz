theorem
Lm1: ((for a being (Element of ( vectgroup M )) holds (ex x being (Element of ( vectgroup M )) st ( Double x ) = a)) & (for a being (Element of ( vectgroup M )) holds (( Double a ) = ( 0. ( vectgroup M ) ) implies a = ( 0. ( vectgroup M ) ))))
proof
set G = ( vectgroup M );
set p = the (Point of M);
thus (for a being (Element of G) holds (ex x being (Element of G) st ( Double x ) = a))
proof
set p = the (Point of M);
let a being (Element of G);
reconsider aa = a as (Vector of M) by CKB20:1;
consider q being (Point of M) such that A1: aa = ( vect (p,q) ) by MIDSP_1:35;
set xx = ( vect (p,( p @ q )) );
reconsider x = xx as (Element of G) by CKB20:1;
take x;
( xx + xx ) = aa by A1,MIDSP_1:42;
hence thesis by CKB20:1;
end;

let a being (Element of G);
reconsider aa = a as (Vector of M) by CKB20:1;
consider q being (Point of M) such that A2: aa = ( vect (p,q) ) by MIDSP_1:35;
consider r being (Point of M) such that A3: aa = ( vect (q,r) ) by MIDSP_1:35;
assume ( Double a ) = ( 0. G );
then ( aa + aa ) = ( 0. G ) by CKB20:1
.= ( ID M ) by CKB20:1;
then ( ( vect (p,q) ) + ( vect (q,r) ) ) = ( vect (p,p) ) by A2,A3,MIDSP_1:38;
then ( vect (p,r) ) = ( vect (p,p) ) by MIDSP_1:40;
then ( vect (p,q) ) = ( vect (q,p) ) by A2,A3,MIDSP_1:39;
then A4: ( p @ p ) = ( q @ q ) by MIDSP_1:37;
p = ( p @ p ) by MIDSP_1:def 3
.= q by A4,MIDSP_1:def 3;
hence a = ( ID M ) by A2,MIDSP_1:38
