definition
func props -> (Subset of ( LTLB_WFF ))
means
(for x being set holds (x in it iff (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st x = ( prop n ))));
existence
proof
defpred P1[ set ]
 means
(ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st $1 = ( prop n ));
consider X being set such that A1: (for x being set holds (x in X iff (x in ( LTLB_WFF ) & P1[ x ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
X c= ( LTLB_WFF )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in X;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
then reconsider X as (Subset of ( LTLB_WFF ));
take X;
thus (for x being set holds (x in X iff (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st x = ( prop n )))) by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let A being (Subset of ( LTLB_WFF )),B being (Subset of ( LTLB_WFF ));
assume that
A2: (for x being set holds (x in A iff (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st x = ( prop n ))))
and
A3: (for x being set holds (x in B iff (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st x = ( prop n ))));
A4: B c= A
proof
let x being set;
assume x in B;
then consider n being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A5: x = ( prop n ) by A3;
thus x in A by A2,A5;
end;
A c= B
proof
let x being set;
assume x in A;
then consider n being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A6: x = ( prop n ) by A2;
thus x in B by A3,A6;
end;
hence A = B by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
