theorem
Th56: (for X being  T_1 non empty TopSpace holds (for B being (prebasis of X) holds ((for x being (Point of X) holds (for V being (Subset of X) holds ((x in V & V in B) implies (ex f being  continuous (Function of X,( I[01] )) st (( f . x ) = ( 0 ) & ( f .: ( V ` ) ) c= { 1 }))))) implies X is  Tychonoff)))
proof
reconsider z = ( 0 ) as (Point of ( I[01] )) by BORSUK_1:40,XXREAL_1:1;
let X being  T_1 non empty TopSpace;
let BB being (prebasis of X);
assume that
A1: (for x being (Point of X) holds (for V being (Subset of X) holds ((x in V & V in BB) implies (ex f being  continuous (Function of X,( I[01] )) st (( f . x ) = ( 0 ) & ( f .: ( V ` ) ) c= { 1 })))));
let A being  closed (Subset of X);
let a being (Point of X);
A2: ( FinMeetCl BB ) is (Basis of X) by YELLOW_9:23;
assume a in ( A ` );
then consider B being (Subset of X) such that A3: B in ( FinMeetCl BB ) and A4: a in B and A5: B c= ( A ` ) by A2,YELLOW_9:31;
consider F being (Subset-Family of X) such that A6: F c= BB and A7: F is  finite and A8: B = ( Intersect F ) by A3,CANTOR_1:def 3;
per cases ;
suppose F is  empty;

then B = (the carrier of X) by A8,SETFAM_1:def 9;
then ( ( A ` ) ` ) = ( {} X ) by A5,XBOOLE_1:37;
then A9: ( ( X --> z ) .: A ) = ( {} ) by RELAT_1:116;
( ( X --> z ) . a ) = z by FUNCOP_1:7;
hence thesis by A9,XBOOLE_1:2;
end;
suppose F is non empty;

then reconsider F as  finite non empty (Subset-Family of X) by A7;
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(ex S being (Subset of X) st (ex f being  continuous (Function of X,( I[01] )) st (((S = $1 & f = $2) & ( f . a ) = ( 0 )) & ( f .: ( S ` ) ) c= { 1 })));
reconsider Sa = { (( 0 ) qua Real) } as  finite non empty (Subset of ( REAL ));
set z = the (Element of F);
set R = ( I[01] );
A10: (for x being set holds (x in F implies (ex y being set st P[ x,y ])))
proof
let x being set;
assume A11: x in F;
then reconsider S = x as (Subset of X);
a in S by A4,A8,A11,SETFAM_1:43;
then consider f being  continuous (Function of X,( I[01] )) such that A12: ( f . a ) = ( 0 ) and A13: ( f .: ( S ` ) ) c= { 1 } by A6,A11,A1;
take f;
thus thesis by A12,A13;
end;
consider G being Function such that A14: (( dom G ) = F & (for x being set holds (x in F implies P[ x,( G . x ) ]))) from CLASSES1:sch 1(A10);
G is  Function-yielding
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( dom G );
then P[ x,( G . x ) ] by A14;
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider G as (ManySortedFunction of F) by A14,PARTFUN1:def 2,RELAT_1:def 18;
( rng G ) c= ( Funcs ((the carrier of X),(the carrier of R)) )
proof
let u;
assume u in ( rng G );
then consider v such that A15: v in ( dom G ) and A16: u = ( G . v ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
P[ v,u ] by A14,A15,A16;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:8;
end;
then G is (Function of F,( Funcs ((the carrier of X),(the carrier of R)) )) by A14,FUNCT_2:2;
then A17: G in ( Funcs (F,( Funcs ((the carrier of X),(the carrier of R)) )) ) by FUNCT_2:8;
then ( commute G ) in ( Funcs ((the carrier of X),( Funcs (F,(the carrier of R)) )) ) by FUNCT_6:55;
then reconsider cG = ( commute G ) as (Function of (the carrier of X),( Funcs (F,(the carrier of R)) )) by FUNCT_2:66;
now
let a being set;
assume a in F;
then P[ a,( G . a ) ] by A14;
hence ( G . a ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of X,( I[01] ));
end;
then consider f being  continuous (Function of X,( I[01] )) such that A18: (for x being (Point of X) holds (for S being  finite non empty (Subset of ( REAL )) holds (S = ( rng ( ( commute G ) . x ) ) implies ( f . x ) = ( max S )))) by CKB62:1;
take f;
reconsider cGa = ( cG . a ) as (Function of F,(the carrier of R)) by FUNCT_2:66;
A19: ( dom cGa ) = F by FUNCT_2:def 1;
Sa = ( rng ( ( commute G ) . a ) )
proof
thus Sa c= ( rng ( ( commute G ) . a ) )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in Sa;
then A20: x = ( 0 ) by TARSKI:def 1;
P[ z,( G . z ) ] by A14;
then x = ( ( ( commute G ) . a ) . z ) by A20,A17,FUNCT_6:56;
hence thesis by A19,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;

let x being set;
assume x in ( rng ( ( commute G ) . a ) );
then consider z being set such that A21: z in ( dom cGa ) and A22: x = ( cGa . z ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
P[ z,( G . z ) ] by A14,A21;
then x = ( 0 ) by A17,A21,A22,FUNCT_6:56;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 1;
end;
hence ( f . a ) = ( max Sa ) by A18
.= ( 0 ) by XXREAL_2:11;
let z being set;
assume z in ( f .: A );
then consider x being set such that A23: x in ( dom f ) and A24: x in A and A25: z = ( f . x ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
reconsider x as (Element of X) by A23;
(not x in B) by A5,A24,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then consider w such that A26: w in F and A27: (not x in w) by A8,SETFAM_1:43;
reconsider cGx = ( cG . x ) as (Function of F,(the carrier of R)) by FUNCT_2:66;
reconsider S = ( rng cGx ) as  finite non empty (Subset of ( REAL )) by BORSUK_1:40,XBOOLE_1:1;
A28: ( f . x ) = ( max S ) by A18;
consider T being (Subset of X),g being  continuous (Function of X,R) such that A29: T = w and A30: g = ( G . w ) and ( g . a ) = ( 0 ) and A31: ( g .: ( T ` ) ) c= { 1 } by A14,A26;
x in ( T ` ) by A27,A29,SUBSET_1:29;
then ( g . x ) in ( g .: ( T ` ) ) by FUNCT_2:35;
then ( g . x ) = 1 by A31,TARSKI:def 1;
then A32: ( cGx . w ) = 1 by A17,A26,A30,FUNCT_6:56;
w in ( dom cGx ) by A17,A26,A30,FUNCT_6:56;
then A33: 1 in S by A32,FUNCT_1:def 3;
(for r being  ext-real number holds (r in S implies r <= 1)) by BORSUK_1:40,XXREAL_1:1;
then ( max S ) = 1 by A33,XXREAL_2:def 8;
hence thesis by A25,A28,TARSKI:def 1;
