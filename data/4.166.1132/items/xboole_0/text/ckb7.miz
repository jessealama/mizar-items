begin
reserve x for set;
definition
let X being set;
let Y being set;
func X \ Y -> set
means
:Def5: (x in it iff (x in X & (not x in Y)));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(not $1 in Y);
thus (ex Z being set st (for x holds (x in Z iff (x in X & P[ x ])))) from CKB1:sch 1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let A1 being set,A2 being set;
assume that
A7: (x in A1 iff (x in X & (not x in Y)))
and
A8: (x in A2 iff (x in X & (not x in Y)));
now
let x;
(x in A1 iff (x in X & (not x in Y))) by A7;
hence (x in A1 iff x in A2) by A8;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
end;
