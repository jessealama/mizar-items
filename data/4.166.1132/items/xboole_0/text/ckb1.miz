proof
defpred Q[ set,set ]
 means
($1 = $2 & P[ $2 ]);
A1: (for x holds (for y holds (for z holds ((Q[ x,y ] & Q[ x,z ]) implies y = z))));
consider X such that A2: (for x holds (x in X iff (ex y st (y in A() & Q[ y,x ])))) from TARSKI:sch 1(A1);
take X;
let x;
(x in X iff (ex y st ((y in A() & y = x) & P[ x ]))) by A2;
hence thesis;
