theorem
(for X1,X2,Y1,Y2 being non empty (SubSpace of X) holds ((((Y1 is (SubSpace of X1) & Y2 is (SubSpace of X2)) & Y1 meets Y2) & ( Y1 meet Y2 ) = ( X1 meet X2 )) implies (X1,X2 are_weakly_separated  implies Y1,Y2 are_weakly_separated )))
proof
let X1 being non empty (SubSpace of X),X2 being non empty (SubSpace of X),Y1 being non empty (SubSpace of X),Y2 being non empty (SubSpace of X);
reconsider A1 = (the carrier of X1),A2 = (the carrier of X2) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
reconsider C1 = (the carrier of Y1),C2 = (the carrier of Y2) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
assume (Y1 is (SubSpace of X1) & Y2 is (SubSpace of X2));
then A1: (C1 c= A1 & C2 c= A2) by TSEP_1:4;
assume A2: Y1 meets Y2;
assume A3: ( Y1 meet Y2 ) = ( X1 meet X2 );
assume X1,X2 are_weakly_separated ;
then A4: A1,A2 are_weakly_separated  by TSEP_1:def 7;
now
let C1 being (Subset of X),C2 being (Subset of X);
assume A5: (C1 = (the carrier of Y1) & C2 = (the carrier of Y2));
then C1 meets C2 by A2,TSEP_1:def 3;
then ( C1 /\ C2 ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then ( A1 /\ A2 ) <> ( {} ) by A1,A5,XBOOLE_1:3,XBOOLE_1:27;
then A1 meets A2 by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then X1 meets X2 by TSEP_1:def 3;
then ( A1 /\ A2 ) = (the carrier of ( X1 meet X2 )) by TSEP_1:def 4;
then ( A1 /\ A2 ) = ( C1 /\ C2 ) by A2,A3,A5,TSEP_1:def 4;
hence C1,C2 are_weakly_separated  by A1,A4,A5,CKB27:1;
end;
hence thesis by TSEP_1:def 7;
