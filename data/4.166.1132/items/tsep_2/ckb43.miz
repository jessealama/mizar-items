begin
reserve X for non empty TopSpace;
theorem
Th39: (for X1,X2,Y1,Y2 being (SubSpace of X) holds ((X1,Y1 constitute_a_decomposition  & X2,Y2 constitute_a_decomposition ) implies (X1,X2 are_weakly_separated  implies Y1,Y2 are_weakly_separated )))
proof
let X1 being (SubSpace of X),X2 being (SubSpace of X),Y1 being (SubSpace of X),Y2 being (SubSpace of X);
assume A1: (for A1,B1 being (Subset of X) holds ((A1 = (the carrier of X1) & B1 = (the carrier of Y1)) implies A1,B1 constitute_a_decomposition ));
assume A2: (for A2,B2 being (Subset of X) holds ((A2 = (the carrier of X2) & B2 = (the carrier of Y2)) implies A2,B2 constitute_a_decomposition ));
assume A3: (for A1,A2 being (Subset of X) holds ((A1 = (the carrier of X1) & A2 = (the carrier of X2)) implies A1,A2 are_weakly_separated ));
now
reconsider A1 = (the carrier of X1),A2 = (the carrier of X2) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
let B1 being (Subset of X),B2 being (Subset of X);
assume (B1 = (the carrier of Y1) & B2 = (the carrier of Y2));
then A4: (A1,B1 constitute_a_decomposition  & A2,B2 constitute_a_decomposition ) by A1,A2;
A1,A2 are_weakly_separated  by A3;
hence B1,B2 are_weakly_separated  by A4,CKB18:1;
end;
hence thesis by TSEP_1:def 7;
