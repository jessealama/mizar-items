begin
reserve X for non empty TopSpace;
theorem
Th34: (for X1,X2,Y1,Y2 being non empty (SubSpace of X) holds ((X1,Y1 constitute_a_decomposition  & X2,Y2 constitute_a_decomposition ) implies (( Y1 union Y2 ) = ( the TopStruct of X ) iff X1 misses X2)))
proof
let X1 being non empty (SubSpace of X),X2 being non empty (SubSpace of X),Y1 being non empty (SubSpace of X),Y2 being non empty (SubSpace of X);
reconsider A1 = (the carrier of X1),A2 = (the carrier of X2) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
reconsider B1 = (the carrier of Y1),B2 = (the carrier of Y2) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
assume that
A1: X1,Y1 constitute_a_decomposition 
and
A2: X2,Y2 constitute_a_decomposition ;
A3: A2,B2 constitute_a_decomposition  by A2,CKB32:def 1;
then A4: A2 = ( B2 ` ) by CKB5:1;
A5: A2 = ( B2 ` ) by A3,CKB5:1;
A6: A1,B1 constitute_a_decomposition  by A1,CKB32:def 1;
then A7: A1 = ( B1 ` ) by CKB5:1;
thus (( Y1 union Y2 ) = ( the TopStruct of X ) implies X1 misses X2)
proof
assume ( Y1 union Y2 ) = ( the TopStruct of X );
then ( B1 \/ B2 ) = (the carrier of X) by TSEP_1:def 2;
then ( ( B1 \/ B2 ) ` ) = ( {} X ) by XBOOLE_1:37;
then ( A1 /\ A2 ) = ( {} ) by A7,A5,XBOOLE_1:53;
then A1 misses A2 by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
hence thesis by TSEP_1:def 3;
end;

assume X1 misses X2;
then A1 misses A2 by TSEP_1:def 3;
then A8: ( A1 /\ A2 ) = ( {} X ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
A1 = ( B1 ` ) by A6,CKB5:1;
then ( ( B1 \/ B2 ) ` ) = ( {} X ) by A4,A8,XBOOLE_1:53;
then ( B1 \/ B2 ) = ( ( {} X ) ` );
then A9: (the carrier of ( Y1 union Y2 )) = (the carrier of X) by TSEP_1:def 2;
X is (SubSpace of X) by TSEP_1:2;
hence thesis by A9,TSEP_1:5;
