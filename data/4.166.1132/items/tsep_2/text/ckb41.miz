begin
reserve X for non empty TopSpace;
reserve X1 for non empty (SubSpace of X);
reserve X2 for non empty (SubSpace of X);
reserve Y1 for non empty (SubSpace of X);
reserve Y2 for non empty (SubSpace of X);
theorem
Th37: (((X1 meets Y1 & X1,X2 constitute_a_decomposition ) & Y1,Y2 constitute_a_decomposition ) implies ( X1 meet Y1 ),( X2 union Y2 ) constitute_a_decomposition )
proof
reconsider A1 = (the carrier of X1),A2 = (the carrier of X2) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
reconsider B1 = (the carrier of Y1),B2 = (the carrier of Y2) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
assume A1: X1 meets Y1;
assume (for A1,A2 being (Subset of X) holds ((A1 = (the carrier of X1) & A2 = (the carrier of X2)) implies A1,A2 constitute_a_decomposition ));
then A2: A1,A2 constitute_a_decomposition ;
assume (for B1,B2 being (Subset of X) holds ((B1 = (the carrier of Y1) & B2 = (the carrier of Y2)) implies B1,B2 constitute_a_decomposition ));
then A3: B1,B2 constitute_a_decomposition ;
now
let C being (Subset of X),D being (Subset of X);
assume (C = (the carrier of ( X1 meet Y1 )) & D = (the carrier of ( X2 union Y2 )));
then (C = ( A1 /\ B1 ) & D = ( A2 \/ B2 )) by A1,TSEP_1:def 2,TSEP_1:def 4;
hence C,D constitute_a_decomposition  by A2,A3,CKB16:1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB32:def 1;
