theorem
Th46: (for X1,X2 being (SubSpace of X) holds (for Y1,Y2 being (SubSpace of X0) holds (((the carrier of X1) = (the carrier of Y1) & (the carrier of X2) = (the carrier of Y2)) implies (X1,X2 are_separated  iff Y1,Y2 are_separated ))))
proof
let X1 being (SubSpace of X),X2 being (SubSpace of X);
let X01 being (SubSpace of X0),X02 being (SubSpace of X0);
reconsider A1 = (the carrier of X1),A2 = (the carrier of X2) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
reconsider B1 = (the carrier of X01),B2 = (the carrier of X02) as (Subset of X0) by TSEP_1:1;
assume A1: ((the carrier of X1) = (the carrier of X01) & (the carrier of X2) = (the carrier of X02));
thus (X1,X2 are_separated  implies X01,X02 are_separated )
proof
assume X1,X2 are_separated ;
then A1,A2 are_separated  by TSEP_1:def 6;
then (for B1,B2 being (Subset of X0) holds ((B1 = (the carrier of X01) & B2 = (the carrier of X02)) implies B1,B2 are_separated )) by A1,CKB28:1;
hence thesis by TSEP_1:def 6;
end;

thus (X01,X02 are_separated  implies X1,X2 are_separated )
proof
assume X01,X02 are_separated ;
then B1,B2 are_separated  by TSEP_1:def 6;
then (for A1,A2 being (Subset of X) holds ((A1 = (the carrier of X1) & A2 = (the carrier of X2)) implies A1,A2 are_separated )) by A1,CKB28:1;
