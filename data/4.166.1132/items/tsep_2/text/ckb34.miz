theorem
Th30: (X1,X2 constitute_a_decomposition  iff (X1 misses X2 & ( the TopStruct of X ) = ( X1 union X2 )))
proof
reconsider A1 = (the carrier of X1),A2 = (the carrier of X2) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
thus (X1,X2 constitute_a_decomposition  implies (X1 misses X2 & ( the TopStruct of X ) = ( X1 union X2 )))
proof
assume (for A1,A2 being (Subset of X) holds ((A1 = (the carrier of X1) & A2 = (the carrier of X2)) implies A1,A2 constitute_a_decomposition ));
then A1: A1,A2 constitute_a_decomposition ;
then A1 misses A2 by CKB2:def 1;
hence X1 misses X2 by TSEP_1:def 3;
( A1 \/ A2 ) = (the carrier of X) by A1,CKB2:def 1;
then A2: (the carrier of ( X1 union X2 )) = (the carrier of X) by TSEP_1:def 2;
X is (SubSpace of X) by TSEP_1:2;
hence thesis by A2,TSEP_1:5;
end;

assume A3: X1 misses X2;
assume A4: ( the TopStruct of X ) = ( X1 union X2 );
now
let A1 being (Subset of X),A2 being (Subset of X);
assume (A1 = (the carrier of X1) & A2 = (the carrier of X2));
then (A1 misses A2 & ( A1 \/ A2 ) = (the carrier of X)) by A3,A4,TSEP_1:def 2,TSEP_1:def 3;
hence A1,A2 constitute_a_decomposition  by CKB2:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB32:def 1;
