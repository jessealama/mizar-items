theorem
Th35: (X1,X2 constitute_a_decomposition  implies (X1 is  open iff X2 is  closed))
proof
reconsider A1 = (the carrier of X1),A2 = (the carrier of X2) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
assume A1: (for A1,A2 being (Subset of X) holds ((A1 = (the carrier of X1) & A2 = (the carrier of X2)) implies A1,A2 constitute_a_decomposition ));
thus (X1 is  open implies X2 is  closed)
proof
assume A2: (for A1 being (Subset of X) holds (A1 = (the carrier of X1) implies A1 is  open));
now
let A2 being (Subset of X);
assume A2 = (the carrier of X2);
then A3: A1,A2 constitute_a_decomposition  by A1;
A1 is  open by A2;
hence A2 is  closed by A3,CKB14:1;
end;
hence thesis by BORSUK_1:def 11;
end;

assume A4: (for A2 being (Subset of X) holds (A2 = (the carrier of X2) implies A2 is  closed));
now
let A1 being (Subset of X);
assume A1 = (the carrier of X1);
then A5: A1,A2 constitute_a_decomposition  by A1;
A2 is  closed by A4;
hence A1 is  open by A5,CKB14:1;
end;
hence thesis by TSEP_1:def 1;
