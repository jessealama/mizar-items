proof
let z being set;
assume A3: z in iMR;
per cases  by A3,CKB4:1;
suppose z in iR;

then consider c,d being set such that A4: c in cR and A5: d in cR and A6: z = [ c,d ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider c,d as Nat by A1,A4,A5,NECKLACE:3;
(c < n & d < n) by A1,A4,A5,NAT_1:44;
then (c < cMR & d < cMR) by A2,XXREAL_0:2;

hence z in [: cMR,cMR :] by A6,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
end;
suppose z in { [ x,( y + n ) ] where x is (Element of ( NAT )),y is (Element of ( NAT )): [ x,y ] in iR };

then consider x,y being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A7: z = [ x,( y + n ) ] and A8: [ x,y ] in iR;
x in cR by A8,ZFMISC_1:87;
then x < n by A1,NAT_1:44;

then A9: x in cMR by NAT_1:44;
y in cR by A8,ZFMISC_1:87;
then y < n by A1,NAT_1:44;
then ( y + n ) < ( n + n ) by XREAL_1:6;
then ( y + n ) < ( ( 2 * n ) + 1 ) by NAT_1:13;
then ( y + n ) in cMR by NAT_1:44;
hence z in [: cMR,cMR :] by A7,A9,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
end;
suppose z in { [ ( x + n ),y ] where x is (Element of ( NAT )),y is (Element of ( NAT )): [ x,y ] in iR };

then consider x,y being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A10: z = [ ( x + n ),y ] and A11: [ x,y ] in iR;
y in cR by A11,ZFMISC_1:87;
then y < n by A1,NAT_1:44;

then ( x + n ) in cMR by NAT_1:44;
hence z in [: cMR,cMR :] by A10,A12,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
end;
suppose z in [: { ( 2 * n ) },( ( 2 * n ) \ n ) :];

then consider c,d being set such that A13: c in { ( 2 * n ) } and A14: d in ( ( 2 * n ) \ n ) and A15: z = [ c,d ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
A16: c = ( 2 * n ) by A13,TARSKI:def 1;
reconsider c as Nat by A13,TARSKI:def 1;
c < ( ( 2 * n ) + 1 ) by A16,NAT_1:13;

end;
suppose z in [: ( ( 2 * n ) \ n ),{ ( 2 * n ) } :];

then consider c,d being set such that A18: c in ( ( 2 * n ) \ n ) and A19: d in { ( 2 * n ) } and A20: z = [ c,d ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;

end;
then reconsider iMR as (Relation of cMR);
set MR = RelStr (# cMR,iMR #);
take MR;
thus (the carrier of MR) = ( ( 2 * n ) + 1 );
thus (the InternalRel of MR) = ( ( ( ( iR \/ { [ x,( y + n ) ] where x is (Element of ( NAT )),y is (Element of ( NAT )): [ x,y ] in iR } ) \/ { [ ( x + n ),y ] where x is (Element of ( NAT )),y is (Element of ( NAT )): [ x,y ] in iR } ) \/ [: { ( 2 * n ) },( ( 2 * n ) \ n ) :] ) \/ [: ( ( 2 * n ) \ n ),{ ( 2 * n ) } :] );

uniqueness
proof
let A being (NatRelStr of ( ( 2 * n ) + 1 ));
let B being (NatRelStr of ( ( 2 * n ) + 1 ));
((the carrier of A) = ( ( 2 * n ) + 1 ) & (the carrier of B) = ( ( 2 * n ) + 1 )) by CKB57:def 1;
