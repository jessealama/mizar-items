reserve X for TopSpace;
theorem
(for X1,X2 being (SubSpace of X) holds ((X1 is (SubSpace of X2) & X2 is (SubSpace of X1)) implies ( the TopStruct of X1 ) = ( the TopStruct of X2 )))
proof
let X1 being (SubSpace of X),X2 being (SubSpace of X);
set A1 = (the carrier of X1);
set A2 = (the carrier of X2);
assume (X1 is (SubSpace of X2) & X2 is (SubSpace of X1));
then (A1 c= A2 & A2 c= A1) by CKB6:1;
then A1 = A2 by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by CKB8:1;
