theorem
(for X being non empty TopSpace holds (for X1 being  closed non empty (SubSpace of X) holds (for X2 being non empty (SubSpace of X) holds ((the carrier of X1) c= (the carrier of X2) implies X1 is  closed non empty  closed non empty (SubSpace of X2)))))
proof
let X being non empty TopSpace;
let X1 being  closed non empty (SubSpace of X);
let X2 being non empty (SubSpace of X);
assume (the carrier of X1) c= (the carrier of X2);
then reconsider B = (the carrier of X1) as (Subset of X2);
now
let C being (Subset of X2);
assume A1: C = (the carrier of X1);
then reconsider A = C as (Subset of X) by BORSUK_1:1;
A2: ( A /\ ( [#] X2 ) ) = C by XBOOLE_1:28;
A is  closed by A1,CKB14:1;
hence C is  closed by A2,PRE_TOPC:13;
end;
then B is  closed;
hence thesis by CKB6:1,CKB14:1;
end;
