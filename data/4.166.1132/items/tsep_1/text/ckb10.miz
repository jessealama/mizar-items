theorem
Th7: (for X1 being (SubSpace of X) holds (for X2 being (SubSpace of X1) holds X2 is (SubSpace of X)))
proof
let X1 being (SubSpace of X);
let X2 being (SubSpace of X1);
A1: ( [#] X2 ) c= ( [#] X1 ) by PRE_TOPC:def 4;
( [#] X1 ) c= ( [#] X ) by PRE_TOPC:def 4;
hence ( [#] X2 ) c= ( [#] X ) by A1,XBOOLE_1:1;
thus (for P being (Subset of X2) holds (P in (the topology of X2) iff (ex Q being (Subset of X) st (Q in (the topology of X) & P = ( Q /\ ( [#] X2 ) )))))
proof
let P being (Subset of X2);
reconsider P1 = P as (Subset of X2);
thus (P in (the topology of X2) implies (ex Q being (Subset of X) st (Q in (the topology of X) & P = ( Q /\ ( [#] X2 ) ))))
proof
assume P in (the topology of X2);
then consider R being (Subset of X1) such that A2: R in (the topology of X1) and A3: P = ( R /\ ( [#] X2 ) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 4;
consider Q being (Subset of X) such that A4: Q in (the topology of X) and A5: R = ( Q /\ ( [#] X1 ) ) by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
( Q /\ ( [#] X2 ) ) = ( Q /\ ( ( [#] X1 ) /\ ( [#] X2 ) ) ) by A1,XBOOLE_1:28
.= P by A3,A5,XBOOLE_1:16;
hence thesis by A4;
end;

given Q being (Subset of X) such that
A6: Q in (the topology of X)
and
A7: P = ( Q /\ ( [#] X2 ) );

reconsider R = ( Q /\ ( [#] X1 ) ) as (Subset of X1);
reconsider Q1 = Q as (Subset of X);
Q1 is  open by A6,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then A8: R is  open by TOPS_2:24;
( R /\ ( [#] X2 ) ) = ( Q /\ ( ( [#] X1 ) /\ ( [#] X2 ) ) ) by XBOOLE_1:16
.= P by A1,A7,XBOOLE_1:28;
then P1 is  open by A8,TOPS_2:24;
hence thesis by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
