theorem
Th5: (for X being TopStruct holds (for X1,X2 being (SubSpace of X) holds ((the carrier of X1) = (the carrier of X2) implies ( the TopStruct of X1 ) = ( the TopStruct of X2 ))))
proof
let X being TopStruct;
let X1 being (SubSpace of X),X2 being (SubSpace of X);
reconsider S1 = ( the TopStruct of X1 ),S2 = ( the TopStruct of X2 ) as  strict (SubSpace of X) by CKB7:1;
set A1 = (the carrier of X1);
set A2 = (the carrier of X2);
assume A1: A1 = A2;
A2: A1 = ( [#] S1 );
A3: A2 = ( [#] S2 );
reconsider A1 as (Subset of X) by BORSUK_1:1;
S1 = ( X | A1 ) by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 5;
hence thesis by A1,A3,PRE_TOPC:def 5;
