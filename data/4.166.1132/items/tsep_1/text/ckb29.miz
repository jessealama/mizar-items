reserve X for non empty TopSpace;
reserve X1 for non empty (SubSpace of X);
reserve X2 for non empty (SubSpace of X);
reserve X3 for non empty (SubSpace of X);
theorem
( ( X1 union X2 ) union X3 ) = ( X1 union ( X2 union X3 ) )
proof
(the carrier of ( ( X1 union X2 ) union X3 )) = ( (the carrier of ( X1 union X2 )) \/ (the carrier of X3) ) by CKB28:def 1
.= ( ( (the carrier of X1) \/ (the carrier of X2) ) \/ (the carrier of X3) ) by CKB28:def 1
.= ( (the carrier of X1) \/ ( (the carrier of X2) \/ (the carrier of X3) ) ) by XBOOLE_1:4
.= ( (the carrier of X1) \/ (the carrier of ( X2 union X3 )) ) by CKB28:def 1
.= (the carrier of ( X1 union ( X2 union X3 ) )) by CKB28:def 1;
hence thesis by CKB8:1;
