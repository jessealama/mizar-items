reserve X for non empty TopSpace;
theorem
(for X1,X2 being non empty (SubSpace of X) holds (X1 meets X2 implies ((X1 is (SubSpace of X2) iff ( X1 meet X2 ) = ( the TopStruct of X1 )) & (X2 is (SubSpace of X1) iff ( X1 meet X2 ) = ( the TopStruct of X2 )))))
proof
let X1 being non empty (SubSpace of X),X2 being non empty (SubSpace of X);
set A1 = (the carrier of X1);
set A2 = (the carrier of X2);
assume A1: X1 meets X2;
thus (X1 is (SubSpace of X2) iff ( X1 meet X2 ) = ( the TopStruct of X1 ))
proof
thus (X1 is (SubSpace of X2) implies ( X1 meet X2 ) = ( the TopStruct of X1 ))
proof
assume X1 is (SubSpace of X2);
then A2: ( A1 /\ A2 ) = (the carrier of ( the TopStruct of X1 )) by BORSUK_1:1,XBOOLE_1:28;
( the TopStruct of X1 ) is  strict  strict (SubSpace of X) by CKB7:1;
hence thesis by A1,A2,CKB36:def 1;
end;

assume ( X1 meet X2 ) = ( the TopStruct of X1 );
then ( A1 /\ A2 ) = A1 by A1,CKB36:def 1;
then A1 c= A2 by XBOOLE_1:17;
hence thesis by CKB6:1;
end;

thus (X2 is (SubSpace of X1) iff ( X1 meet X2 ) = ( the TopStruct of X2 ))
proof
thus (X2 is (SubSpace of X1) implies ( X1 meet X2 ) = ( the TopStruct of X2 ))
proof
assume X2 is (SubSpace of X1);
then A3: ( A1 /\ A2 ) = (the carrier of ( the TopStruct of X2 )) by BORSUK_1:1,XBOOLE_1:28;
( the TopStruct of X2 ) is  strict  strict (SubSpace of X) by CKB7:1;
hence thesis by A1,A3,CKB36:def 1;
end;

assume ( X1 meet X2 ) = ( the TopStruct of X2 );
then ( A1 /\ A2 ) = A2 by A1,CKB36:def 1;
then A2 c= A1 by XBOOLE_1:17;
hence thesis by CKB6:1;
