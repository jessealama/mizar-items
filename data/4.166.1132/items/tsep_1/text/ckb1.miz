theorem
Lm1: (for A being set holds (for B,C,D being (Subset of A) holds (( B \ C ) = ( {} ) implies B misses ( D \ C ))))
proof
let A being set;
let B being (Subset of A),C being (Subset of A),D being (Subset of A);
assume ( B \ C ) = ( {} );
then A1: B c= C by XBOOLE_1:37;
C misses ( D \ C ) by XBOOLE_1:79;
hence thesis by A1,XBOOLE_1:63;
