theorem
Lm4: (for T being TopStruct holds ( the TopStruct of T ) is (SubSpace of T))
proof
let T being TopStruct;
set S = ( the TopStruct of T );
thus ( [#] S ) c= ( [#] T );
let P being (Subset of S);
hereby
reconsider Q = P as (Subset of T);
assume A1: P in (the topology of S);
take Q;
thus Q in (the topology of T) by A1;
thus P = ( Q /\ ( [#] S ) ) by XBOOLE_1:28;
end;
given Q being (Subset of T) such that
A2: (Q in (the topology of T) & P = ( Q /\ ( [#] S ) ));

thus thesis by A2,XBOOLE_1:28;
end;
