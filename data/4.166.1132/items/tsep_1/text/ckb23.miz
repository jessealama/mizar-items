theorem
Th16: (for X0 being (SubSpace of X) holds (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A = (the carrier of X0) implies (X0 is  open  open (SubSpace of X) iff A is  open))))
proof
let X0 being (SubSpace of X);
let A being (Subset of X);
assume A1: A = (the carrier of X0);
hence (X0 is  open  open (SubSpace of X) implies A is  open) by CKB19:def 1;
thus (A is  open implies X0 is  open  open (SubSpace of X))
proof
assume A is  open;
then (for B being (Subset of X) holds (B = (the carrier of X0) implies B is  open)) by A1;
hence thesis by CKB19:def 1;
