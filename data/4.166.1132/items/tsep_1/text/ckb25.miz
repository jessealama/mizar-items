theorem
(for X1 being  open (SubSpace of X) holds (for X2 being  open (SubSpace of X1) holds X2 is  open  open (SubSpace of X)))
proof
let X1 being  open (SubSpace of X);
let X2 being  open (SubSpace of X1);
now
reconsider C = ( [#] X1 ) as (Subset of X) by BORSUK_1:1;
let B being (Subset of X);
assume A1: B = (the carrier of X2);
then reconsider BB = B as (Subset of X1) by BORSUK_1:1;
BB is  open by A1,CKB19:def 1;
then A2: (ex A being (Subset of X) st (A is  open & ( A /\ ( [#] X1 ) ) = BB)) by TOPS_2:24;
C is  open by CKB19:def 1;
hence B is  open by A2;
end;
hence thesis by CKB19:def 1,CKB10:1;
