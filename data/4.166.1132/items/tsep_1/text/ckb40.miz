theorem
(for X1,X2 being  closed non empty (SubSpace of X) holds (X1 meets X2 implies ( X1 meet X2 ) is  closed  closed (SubSpace of X)))
proof
let X1 being  closed non empty (SubSpace of X),X2 being  closed non empty (SubSpace of X);
assume that
A1: X1 meets X2;
reconsider A2 = (the carrier of X2) as (Subset of X) by CKB3:1;
reconsider A1 = (the carrier of X1) as (Subset of X) by CKB3:1;
reconsider A = (the carrier of ( X1 meet X2 )) as (Subset of X) by CKB3:1;
(A1 is  closed & A2 is  closed) by CKB14:1;
then ( A1 /\ A2 ) is  closed;
then A is  closed by A1,CKB36:def 1;
hence thesis by CKB14:1;
