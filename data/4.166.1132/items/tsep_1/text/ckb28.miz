definition
let X being non empty TopStruct;
let X1 being non empty (SubSpace of X);
let X2 being non empty (SubSpace of X);
func X1 union X2 ->  strict non empty (SubSpace of X)
means
:Def2: (the carrier of it) = ( (the carrier of X1) \/ (the carrier of X2) );
existence
proof
reconsider A1 = (the carrier of X1),A2 = (the carrier of X2) as (Subset of X) by CKB3:1;
set A = ( A1 \/ A2 );
reconsider A as non empty (Subset of X);
take ( X | A );
thus (the carrier of ( X | A )) = ( [#] ( X | A ) )
.= ( (the carrier of X1) \/ (the carrier of X2) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
