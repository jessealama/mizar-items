theorem
Th2: (for X being TopStruct holds X is (SubSpace of X))
proof
let X being TopStruct;
thus ( [#] X ) c= ( [#] X );
thus (for P being (Subset of X) holds (P in (the topology of X) iff (ex Q being (Subset of X) st (Q in (the topology of X) & P = ( Q /\ ( [#] X ) )))))
proof
let P being (Subset of X);
thus (P in (the topology of X) implies (ex Q being (Subset of X) st (Q in (the topology of X) & P = ( Q /\ ( [#] X ) ))))
proof
assume A1: P in (the topology of X);
take P;
thus thesis by A1,XBOOLE_1:28;
end;

thus thesis by XBOOLE_1:28;
end;
