theorem
(for X0 being  open (SubSpace of X) holds (for A being (Subset of X) holds (for B being (Subset of X0) holds (A = B implies (B is  open iff A is  open)))))
proof
let X0 being  open (SubSpace of X);
let A being (Subset of X);
let B being (Subset of X0);
assume that
A1: A = B;
reconsider C = (the carrier of X0) as (Subset of X) by CKB3:1;
C is  open by CKB23:1;
hence thesis by A1,CKB12:1;
