theorem
(X1,X2 are_separated  iff (ex Y1,Y2 being  closed non empty (SubSpace of X) st (((X1 is (SubSpace of Y1) & X2 is (SubSpace of Y2)) & Y1 misses X2) & Y2 misses X1)))
proof
reconsider A2 = (the carrier of X2) as (Subset of X) by CKB3:1;
reconsider A1 = (the carrier of X1) as (Subset of X) by CKB3:1;
thus (X1,X2 are_separated  implies (ex Y1,Y2 being  closed non empty (SubSpace of X) st (((X1 is (SubSpace of Y1) & X2 is (SubSpace of Y2)) & Y1 misses X2) & Y2 misses X1)))
proof
assume X1,X2 are_separated ;
then A1,A2 are_separated  by CKB77:def 1;
then consider C1 being (Subset of X),C2 being (Subset of X) such that A1: A1 c= C1 and A2: A2 c= C2 and A3: (C1 misses A2 & C2 misses A1) and A4: C1 is  closed and A5: C2 is  closed by CKB54:1;
C1 is non empty by A1,XBOOLE_1:3;
then consider Y1 being  strict  closed non empty (SubSpace of X) such that A6: C1 = (the carrier of Y1) by A4,CKB18:1;
C2 is non empty by A2,XBOOLE_1:3;
then consider Y2 being  strict  closed non empty (SubSpace of X) such that A7: C2 = (the carrier of Y2) by A5,CKB18:1;
take Y1;
take Y2;
thus thesis by A1,A2,A3,A6,A7,CKB34:def 1,CKB6:1;
end;

given Y1 being  closed non empty (SubSpace of X),Y2 being  closed non empty (SubSpace of X) such that
A8: (((X1 is (SubSpace of Y1) & X2 is (SubSpace of Y2)) & Y1 misses X2) & Y2 misses X1);

now
let A1 being (Subset of X),A2 being (Subset of X);
assume that
A9: (A1 = (the carrier of X1) & A2 = (the carrier of X2));
(ex C1,C2 being (Subset of X) st (((((A1 c= C1 & A2 c= C2) & C1 misses A2) & C2 misses A1) & C1 is  closed) & C2 is  closed))
proof
reconsider C2 = (the carrier of Y2) as (Subset of X) by CKB3:1;
reconsider C1 = (the carrier of Y1) as (Subset of X) by CKB3:1;
take C1;
take C2;
thus thesis by A8,A9,CKB34:def 1,CKB6:1,CKB14:1;
end;
hence A1,A2 are_separated  by CKB54:1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB77:def 1;
