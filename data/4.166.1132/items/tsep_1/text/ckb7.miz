theorem
Lm3: (for X being TopStruct holds (for X0 being (SubSpace of X) holds ( the TopStruct of X0 ) is  strict  strict (SubSpace of X)))
proof
let X being TopStruct;
let X0 being (SubSpace of X);
set S = ( the TopStruct of X0 );
S is (SubSpace of X)
proof
A1: ( [#] X0 ) = (the carrier of X0);
hence ( [#] S ) c= ( [#] X ) by PRE_TOPC:def 4;
let P being (Subset of S);
thus (P in (the topology of S) implies (ex Q being (Subset of X) st (Q in (the topology of X) & P = ( Q /\ ( [#] S ) )))) by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
given Q being (Subset of X) such that
A2: (Q in (the topology of X) & P = ( Q /\ ( [#] S ) ));

thus thesis by A1,A2,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
end;
hence thesis;
