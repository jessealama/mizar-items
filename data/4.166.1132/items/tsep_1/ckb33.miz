reserve X for non empty TopSpace;
theorem
(for X1,X2 being  open non empty (SubSpace of X) holds ( X1 union X2 ) is  open  open (SubSpace of X))
proof
let X1 being  open non empty (SubSpace of X),X2 being  open non empty (SubSpace of X);
reconsider A2 = (the carrier of X2) as (Subset of X) by CKB3:1;
reconsider A1 = (the carrier of X1) as (Subset of X) by CKB3:1;
reconsider A = (the carrier of ( X1 union X2 )) as (Subset of X) by CKB3:1;
(A1 is  open & A2 is  open) by CKB23:1;
then ( A1 \/ A2 ) is  open;
then A is  open by CKB28:def 1;
hence thesis by CKB23:1;
