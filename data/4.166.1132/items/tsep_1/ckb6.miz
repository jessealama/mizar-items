theorem
Th4: (for X1,X2 being (SubSpace of X) holds ((the carrier of X1) c= (the carrier of X2) iff X1 is (SubSpace of X2)))
proof
let X1 being (SubSpace of X),X2 being (SubSpace of X);
set A1 = (the carrier of X1);
set A2 = (the carrier of X2);
A1: A1 = ( [#] X1 );
A2: A2 = ( [#] X2 );
thus ((the carrier of X1) c= (the carrier of X2) implies X1 is (SubSpace of X2))
proof
assume A3: A1 c= A2;
(for P being (Subset of X1) holds (P in (the topology of X1) iff (ex Q being (Subset of X2) st (Q in (the topology of X2) & P = ( Q /\ A1 )))))
proof
let P being (Subset of X1);
thus (P in (the topology of X1) implies (ex Q being (Subset of X2) st (Q in (the topology of X2) & P = ( Q /\ A1 ))))
proof
assume P in (the topology of X1);
then consider R being (Subset of X) such that A4: R in (the topology of X) and A5: P = ( R /\ A1 ) by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
reconsider Q = ( R /\ A2 ) as (Subset of X2) by XBOOLE_1:17;
take Q;
thus Q in (the topology of X2) by A2,A4,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
( Q /\ A1 ) = ( R /\ ( A2 /\ A1 ) ) by XBOOLE_1:16
.= ( R /\ A1 ) by A3,XBOOLE_1:28;
hence thesis by A5;
end;

given Q being (Subset of X2) such that
A6: Q in (the topology of X2)
and
A7: P = ( Q /\ A1 );

consider R being (Subset of X) such that A8: R in (the topology of X) and A9: Q = ( R /\ ( [#] X2 ) ) by A6,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
P = ( R /\ ( A2 /\ A1 ) ) by A7,A9,XBOOLE_1:16
.= ( R /\ A1 ) by A3,XBOOLE_1:28;
hence thesis by A1,A8,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
end;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A3,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
end;

thus thesis by A1,A2,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
