theorem
Th9: (for X0 being (SubSpace of X) holds (for C,A being (Subset of X) holds (for B being (Subset of X0) holds ((((C is  open & C c= (the carrier of X0)) & A c= C) & A = B) implies (B is  open iff A is  open)))))
proof
let X0 being (SubSpace of X);
let C being (Subset of X),A being (Subset of X);
let B being (Subset of X0);
assume that
A1: C is  open
and
A2: C c= (the carrier of X0)
and
A3: A c= C
and
A4: A = B;
thus (B is  open implies A is  open)
proof
assume B is  open;
then consider F being (Subset of X) such that A5: F is  open and A6: ( F /\ ( [#] X0 ) ) = B by TOPS_2:24;
A c= F by A4,A6,XBOOLE_1:17;
then A7: A c= ( F /\ C ) by A3,XBOOLE_1:19;
( F /\ C ) c= A by A2,A4,A6,XBOOLE_1:26;
hence thesis by A1,A5,A7,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;

thus thesis by A4,TOPS_2:25;
end;
