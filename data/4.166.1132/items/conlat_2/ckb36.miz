theorem
Th21: (for C being FormalContext holds ( DualHomomorphism C ) is  bijective)
proof
let C being FormalContext;
set f = ( DualHomomorphism C );
A1: ( ConceptLattice C ) = LattStr (# ( B-carrier C ),( B-join C ),( B-meet C ) #) by CONLAT_1:def 20;
A2: ( ( ConceptLattice C ) .: ) = LattStr (# (the carrier of ( ConceptLattice C )),(the L_meet of ( ConceptLattice C )),(the L_join of ( ConceptLattice C )) #) by LATTICE2:def 2;
(the carrier of ( ConceptLattice ( C .: ) )) c= ( rng f )
proof
let u being set;
assume u in (the carrier of ( ConceptLattice ( C .: ) ));
then reconsider u as (Element of ( ConceptLattice ( C .: ) ));
reconsider A9 = (the Intent of ( u @ )) as (Subset of (the carrier of C));
reconsider O9 = (the Extent of ( u @ )) as (Subset of (the carrier' of C));
set CP = ConceptStr (# A9,O9 #);
A3: (not ((the Extent of ( u @ )) is  empty & (the Intent of ( u @ )) is  empty)) by CONLAT_1:def 8;
A4: ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . (the Intent of CP) ) = ( ( ObjectDerivation ( C .: ) ) . (the Extent of ( u @ )) ) by CKB31:1

.= (the Intent of CP) by CONLAT_1:def 10;
then CP is (FormalConcept of C) by A4,A3,CONLAT_1:def 8,CONLAT_1:def 10;
then A6: CP in (the carrier of ( ConceptLattice C )) by A1,CONLAT_1:31;
reconsider CP as  strict (FormalConcept of C) by A5,A4,A3,CONLAT_1:def 8,CONLAT_1:def 10;
A7: (the Extent of ( CP .: )) = (the Extent of ( u @ )) by CKB32:def 1;
(( f . CP ) = ( CP .: ) & (the Intent of ( CP .: )) = (the Intent of ( u @ ))) by CKB32:def 1,CKB35:def 1;
then A8: ( f . CP ) = u by A7,CONLAT_1:def 21;

hence thesis by A8,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;
then ( rng f ) = (the carrier of ( ConceptLattice ( C .: ) )) by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then A9: f is  onto by FUNCT_2:def 3;
f is  one-to-one
proof
let a being set,b being set;
assume that
A10: (a in ( dom f ) & b in ( dom f ))
and
A11: ( f . a ) = ( f . b );
reconsider a,b as (Element of ( ( ConceptLattice C ) .: )) by A10;
( ( ConceptLattice C ) .: ) = LattStr (# (the carrier of ( ConceptLattice C )),(the L_meet of ( ConceptLattice C )),(the L_join of ( ConceptLattice C )) #) by LATTICE2:def 2;
then reconsider a,b as (Element of ( ConceptLattice C ));

A13: (( f . ( a @ ) ) = ( ( a @ ) .: ) & ( f . ( b @ ) ) = ( ( b @ ) .: )) by CKB35:def 1;
then A14: (the Extent of ( a @ )) = (the Intent of ( ( b @ ) .: )) by A11,A12,CKB32:def 1

(the Intent of ( a @ )) = (the Extent of ( ( b @ ) .: )) by A11,A13,A12,CKB32:def 1
.= (the Intent of ( b @ )) by CKB32:def 1;
then a = ( b @ ) by A14,CONLAT_1:def 21
.= b by CONLAT_1:def 21;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by A9;
