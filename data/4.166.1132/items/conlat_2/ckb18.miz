theorem
Th12: (for C being FormalContext holds (( rng ( gamma C ) ) is  supremum-dense & ( rng ( delta C ) ) is  infimum-dense))
proof
let C being FormalContext;
set G = ( rng ( gamma C ) );
thus G is  supremum-dense
proof
let a being (Element of ( ConceptLattice C ));
A1: { ConceptStr (# O,A #) where O is (Subset of (the carrier of C)),A is (Subset of (the carrier' of C)): (ex o being (Object of C) st ((o in (the Extent of ( a @ )) & O = ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . { o } ) )) & A = ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . { o } ))) } c= G
proof
let x being set;
assume x in { ConceptStr (# O,A #) where O is (Subset of (the carrier of C)),A is (Subset of (the carrier' of C)): (ex o being (Object of C) st ((o in (the Extent of ( a @ )) & O = ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . { o } ) )) & A = ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . { o } ))) };
then consider O being (Subset of (the carrier of C)),A being (Subset of (the carrier' of C)) such that A2: x = ConceptStr (# O,A #) and A3: (ex o being (Object of C) st ((o in (the Extent of ( a @ )) & O = ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) .

consider o being (Object of C) such that o in (the Extent of ( a @ )) and O = ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . { o } ) ) and A4: A = ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . { o } ) by A3;
