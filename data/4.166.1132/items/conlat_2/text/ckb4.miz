theorem
Th2: (for C being FormalContext holds (for D being non  empty (Subset-Family of (the carrier of C)) holds ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . ( union D ) ) = ( meet { ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O ) where O is (Subset of (the carrier of C)): O in D } )))
proof
let C being FormalContext;
let D being non  empty (Subset-Family of (the carrier of C));
reconsider D9 = D as non  empty (Subset-Family of (the carrier of C));
set OU = ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . ( union D ) );
set M = ( meet { ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O ) where O is (Subset of (the carrier of C)): O in D } );
per cases ;
suppose A1: { ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O ) where O is (Subset of (the carrier of C)): O in D } <> ( {} );

thus OU c= M
proof
let x being set;
assume x in OU;
then x in { a9 where a9 is (Attribute of C): (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in ( union D9 ) implies o is-connected-with a9)) } by CONLAT_1:def 3;
then A2: (ex x9 being (Attribute of C) st (x9 = x & (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in ( union D ) implies o is-connected-with x9))));
then reconsider x as (Attribute of C);
A3: (for O being (Subset of (the carrier of C)) holds (O in D implies (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with x))))
proof
let O being (Subset of (the carrier of C));
assume A4: O in D;
let o being (Object of C);
assume o in O;
then o in ( union D ) by A4,TARSKI:def 4;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
A5: (for O being (Subset of (the carrier of C)) holds (O in D implies x in ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O )))
proof
let O being (Subset of (the carrier of C));
assume O in D;
then (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with x)) by A3;
then x in { a where a is (Attribute of C): (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with a)) };
hence thesis by CONLAT_1:def 3;
end;
(for Y being set holds (Y in { ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O ) where O is (Subset of (the carrier of C)): O in D } implies x in Y))
proof
let Y being set;
assume Y in { ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O ) where O is (Subset of (the carrier of C)): O in D };
then (ex O being (Subset of (the carrier of C)) st (Y = ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O ) & O in D));
hence thesis by A5;

then reconsider x as (Attribute of C) by A7;
A8: (for O being (Subset of (the carrier of C)) holds (O in D implies x in ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O )))
proof
let O being (Subset of (the carrier of C));
assume O in D;
then ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O ) in { ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O9 ) where O9 is (Subset of (the carrier of C)): O9 in D };
hence thesis by A6,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
A9: (for O being (Subset of (the carrier of C)) holds (O in D implies (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with x))))
proof
let O being (Subset of (the carrier of C));
assume O in D;
then x in ( ( ObjectDerivation C ) . O ) by A8;
then x in { a where a is (Attribute of C): (for o being (Object of C) holds (o in O implies o is-connected-with a)) } by CONLAT_1:def 3;

let o being (Object of C);
assume o in O;
hence thesis by A10;
end;
(for o being (Object of C) holds (o in ( union D ) implies o is-connected-with x))
proof
let o being (Object of C);
assume o in ( union D );
then (ex Y being set st (o in Y & Y in D)) by TARSKI:def 4;
hence thesis by A9;
