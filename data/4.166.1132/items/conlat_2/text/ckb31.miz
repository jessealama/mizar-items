theorem
Th19: (for C being FormalContext holds (for A being (Subset of (the carrier' of C)) holds ( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . A ) = ( ( ObjectDerivation ( C .: ) ) . A )))
proof
let C being FormalContext;
let O being (Subset of (the carrier' of C));
reconsider O9 = O as (Subset of (the carrier of ( C .: )));
set A1 = { a where a is (Object of C): (for o being (Attribute of C) holds (o in O implies a is-connected-with o)) };
set A2 = { a where a is (Attribute of ( C .: )): (for o being (Object of ( C .: )) holds (o in O9 implies o is-connected-with a)) };
A1: A1 c= A2
proof
let u being set;
assume u in A1;
then consider a being (Object of C) such that A2: a = u and A3: (for o being (Attribute of C) holds (o in O implies a is-connected-with o));
reconsider u9 = u as (Attribute of ( C .: )) by A2;
(for o being (Object of ( C .: )) holds (o in O9 implies o is-connected-with u9))
proof
let o9 being (Object of ( C .: ));
reconsider o = o9 as (Attribute of C);
assume o9 in O9;
then a is-connected-with o by A3;
then [ a,o ] in (the Information of C) by CONLAT_1:def 2;
then [ o9,u9 ] in (the Information of ( C .: )) by A2,RELAT_1:def 7;
hence thesis by CONLAT_1:def 2;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
A4: A2 c= A1
proof
let u being set;
assume u in A2;
then consider a being (Attribute of ( C .: )) such that A5: a = u and A6: (for o being (Object of ( C .: )) holds (o in O9 implies o is-connected-with a));
reconsider u9 = u as (Object of C) by A5;
(for o being (Attribute of C) holds (o in O implies u9 is-connected-with o))
proof
let o9 being (Attribute of C);
reconsider o = o9 as (Object of ( C .: ));
assume o9 in O;
then o is-connected-with a by A6;
then [ o,a ] in (the Information of ( C .: )) by CONLAT_1:def 2;
then [ u9,o9 ] in (the Information of C) by A5,RELAT_1:def 7;
hence thesis by CONLAT_1:def 2;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
(( ( AttributeDerivation C ) . O ) = { a where a is (Object of C): (for o being (Attribute of C) holds (o in O implies a is-connected-with o)) } & ( ( ObjectDerivation ( C .: ) ) .
