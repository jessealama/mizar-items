theorem
Th44: (for T being non empty TopSpace holds (T is  Hausdorff iff (for N being (net of T) holds (for p,q being (Point of T) holds ((p in ( Lim N ) & q in ( Lim N )) implies p = q)))))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
thus (T is  Hausdorff implies (for N being (net of T) holds (for p,q being (Point of T) holds ((p in ( Lim N ) & q in ( Lim N )) implies p = q))))
proof
assume A1: T is  Hausdorff;
let N being (net of T);
given p1 being (Point of T),p2 being (Point of T) such that
A2: p1 in ( Lim N )
and

consider W being (Subset of T),V being (Subset of T) such that A5: W is  open and A6: V is  open and A7: p1 in W and A8: p2 in V and A9: W misses V by A1,A4,PRE_TOPC:def 10;
V is (a_neighborhood of p2) by A6,A8,CONNSP_2:3;
