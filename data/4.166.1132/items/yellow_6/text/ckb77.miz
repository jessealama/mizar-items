definition
let T being non  empty 1-sorted;

existence
proof
deffunc F((Element of Y),(Element of ( product J ))) = ( (the mapping of ( J . $1 )) . ( $2 . $1 ) );
set R = [: Y,( product J ) :];
A1: (for i being (Element of Y) holds (for f being (Element of ( product J )) holds F(i,f) in (the carrier of T)));
consider F being (Function of [: (the carrier of Y),(the carrier of ( product J )) :],(the carrier of T)) such that A2: (for i being (Element of Y) holds (for f being (Element of ( product J )) holds ( F . (i,f) ) = F(i,f))) from FUNCT_7:sch 1(A1);
(the carrier of R) = [: (the carrier of Y),(the carrier of ( product J )) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then reconsider F as (Function of (the carrier of R),(the carrier of T));
reconsider N = NetStr (# (the carrier of R),(the InternalRel of R),F #) as  strict (net of T) by CKB18:1,CKB19:1;
take N;
thus ( the RelStr of N ) = [: Y,( product J ) :];
let i being (Element of Y);

assume that

uniqueness
proof
let IT1 being  strict (net of T);
let IT2 being  strict (net of T);
assume that
A4: ( the RelStr of IT1 ) = [: Y,( product J ) :]
and
A5: (for i being (Element of Y) holds (for f being Function holds ((i in (the carrier of Y) & f in (the carrier of ( product J ))) implies ( (the mapping of IT1) . (i,f) ) = ( (the mapping of ( J . i )) . ( f . i ) ))))
and

(the carrier of ( the RelStr of IT2 )) = [: (the carrier of Y),(the carrier of ( product J )) :] by A6,YELLOW_3:def 2;
then reconsider m1 = (the mapping of IT1),m2 = (the mapping of IT2) as (Function of [: (the carrier of Y),(the carrier of ( product J )) :],(the carrier of T)) by A4,A6;
now
let c being (Element of [: (the carrier of Y),(the carrier of ( product J )) :]);
consider c1 being (Element of Y),c2 being (Element of ( product J )) such that A8: c = [ c1,c2 ] by DOMAIN_1:1;
reconsider d = c2 as (Element of ( product ( Carrier J ) )) by YELLOW_1:def 4;
thus ( m1 . c ) = ( m1 . (c1,d) ) by A8
.= ( (the mapping of ( J . c1 )) . ( d . c1 ) ) by A5

hence thesis by A4,A6,FUNCT_2:63;
