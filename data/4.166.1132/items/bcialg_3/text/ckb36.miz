begin
reserve X for BCK-algebra;
reserve x for (Element of X);
reserve y for (Element of X);
theorem
Th23: (for X being  bounded BCK-algebra holds (X is  involutory iff (for a being (Element of X) holds (a is  being_greatest implies (for x,y being (Element of X) holds ( x \ ( a \ y ) ) = ( y \ ( a \ x ) ))))))
proof
let X being  bounded BCK-algebra;
thus (X is  involutory implies (for a being (Element of X) holds (a is  being_greatest implies (for x,y being (Element of X) holds ( x \ ( a \ y ) ) = ( y \ ( a \ x ) )))))
proof
assume A1: X is  involutory;
let a being (Element of X);
assume A2: a is  being_greatest;
let x being (Element of X);
let y being (Element of X);
(( x \ ( a \ y ) ) = ( ( a \ ( a \ y ) ) \ ( a \ x ) ) & ( y \ ( a \ x ) ) = ( ( a \ ( a \ x ) ) \ ( a \ y ) )) by A1,A2,CKB35:1;
hence thesis by BCIALG_1:7;
end;

assume A3: (for a being (Element of X) holds (a is  being_greatest implies (for x,y being (Element of X) holds ( x \ ( a \ y ) ) = ( y \ ( a \ x ) ))));
let a being (Element of X);
assume A4: a is  being_greatest;
let x being (Element of X);
( a \ ( a \ x ) ) = ( x \ ( a \ a ) ) by A3,A4
.= ( x \ ( 0. X ) ) by BCIALG_1:def 5
.= x by BCIALG_1:2;
hence thesis;
