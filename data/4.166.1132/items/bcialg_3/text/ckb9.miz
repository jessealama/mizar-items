theorem
Th6: (for X being non  empty BCIStr_0 holds (X is  commutative  commutative BCK-algebra iff (for x,y,z being (Element of X) holds (( x \ ( ( 0. X ) \ y ) ) = x & ( ( x \ z ) \ ( x \ y ) ) = ( ( y \ z ) \ ( y \ x ) )))))
proof
let X being non  empty BCIStr_0;
thus (X is  commutative  commutative BCK-algebra implies (for x,y,z being (Element of X) holds (( x \ ( ( 0. X ) \ y ) ) = x & ( ( x \ z ) \ ( x \ y ) ) = ( ( y \ z ) \ ( y \ x ) ))))
proof
assume A1: X is  commutative  commutative BCK-algebra;
let x being (Element of X);
let y being (Element of X);
let z being (Element of X);
( ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) \ z ) = ( ( y \ ( y \ x ) ) \ z ) by A1,CKB1:def 1;
then A2: ( ( x \ z ) \ ( x \ y ) ) = ( ( y \ ( y \ x ) ) \ z ) by A1,BCIALG_1:7
.= ( ( y \ z ) \ ( y \ x ) ) by A1,BCIALG_1:7;
( ( 0. X ) \ y ) = ( y ` )
.= ( 0. X ) by A1,BCIALG_1:def 8;
hence thesis by A1,A2,BCIALG_1:2;

A4: (for x,y being (Element of X) holds ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) = ( y \ ( y \ x ) ))
proof
let x being (Element of X);

end;
(for x,y being (Element of X) holds ((( x \ y ) = ( 0. X ) & ( y \ x ) = ( 0. X )) implies x = y))
proof
let x being (Element of X);
let y being (Element of X);
assume (( x \ y ) = ( 0. X ) & ( y \ x ) = ( 0. X ));
then ( ( x \ ( 0. X ) ) \ ( 0. X ) ) = ( ( y \ ( 0. X ) ) \ ( 0. X ) ) by A3;
then ( x \ ( 0. X ) ) = ( ( y \ ( 0. X ) ) \ ( 0. X ) ) by A5
.= ( y \ ( 0. X ) ) by A5;
hence x = ( y \ ( 0. X ) ) by A5
