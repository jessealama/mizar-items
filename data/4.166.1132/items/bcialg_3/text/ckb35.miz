theorem
Th22: (for X being  bounded BCK-algebra holds (X is  involutory iff (for a being (Element of X) holds (a is  being_greatest implies (for x,y being (Element of X) holds ( x \ y ) = ( ( a \ y ) \ ( a \ x ) ))))))
proof
let X being  bounded BCK-algebra;
thus (X is  involutory implies (for a being (Element of X) holds (a is  being_greatest implies (for x,y being (Element of X) holds ( x \ y ) = ( ( a \ y ) \ ( a \ x ) )))))
proof
assume A1: X is  involutory;
let a being (Element of X);
assume A2: a is  being_greatest;
(for x,y being (Element of X) holds ( x \ y ) = ( ( a \ y ) \ ( a \ x ) ))
proof
let x being (Element of X);
let y being (Element of X);
( x \ y ) = ( ( a \ ( a \ x ) ) \ y ) by A1,A2,CKB34:def 1
.= ( ( a \ y ) \ ( a \ x ) ) by BCIALG_1:7;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis;

assume A3: (for a being (Element of X) holds (a is  being_greatest implies (for x,y being (Element of X) holds ( x \ y ) = ( ( a \ y ) \ ( a \ x ) ))));
let a being (Element of X);
assume A4: a is  being_greatest;
now
let x being (Element of X);
( ( a \ ( a \ x ) ) \ ( 0. X ) ) = ( ( a \ ( 0. X ) ) \ ( a \ x ) ) by BCIALG_1:7
.= ( x \ ( 0. X ) ) by A3,A4
.= x by BCIALG_1:2;
hence ( a \ ( a \ x ) ) = x by BCIALG_1:2;
end;
hence thesis;
