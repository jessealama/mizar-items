theorem
(for X being BCI-algebra holds (X is  BCI-commutative iff (for x,y,z being (Element of X) holds ((x <= z & ( z \ y ) <= ( z \ x )) implies x <= y))))
proof
let X being BCI-algebra;
A1: ((for x,y,z being (Element of X) holds ((x <= z & ( z \ y ) <= ( z \ x )) implies x <= y)) implies X is  BCI-commutative)
proof
assume A2: (for x,y,z being (Element of X) holds ((x <= z & ( z \ y ) <= ( z \ x )) implies x <= y));
(for x,z being (Element of X) holds (( x \ z ) = ( 0. X ) implies x = ( z \ ( z \ x ) )))
proof
let x being (Element of X);
let z being (Element of X);
set y = ( z \ ( z \ x ) );
( ( z \ y ) \ ( z \ x ) ) = ( ( z \ x ) \ ( z \ x ) ) by BCIALG_1:8
.= ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:def 5;
then A3: ( z \ y ) <= ( z \ x ) by BCIALG_1:def 11;
assume ( x \ z ) = ( 0. X );
then x <= z by BCIALG_1:def 11;
then x <= ( z \ ( z \ x ) ) by A2,A3;
then A4: ( x \ ( z \ ( z \ x ) ) ) = ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:def 11;
( ( z \ ( z \ x ) ) \ x ) = ( ( z \ x ) \ ( z \ x ) ) by BCIALG_1:7
.= ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:def 5;

(X is  BCI-commutative implies (for x,y,z being (Element of X) holds ((x <= z & ( z \ y ) <= ( z \ x )) implies x <= y)))
proof
assume A5: X is  BCI-commutative;
(for x,y,z being (Element of X) holds ((x <= z & ( z \ y ) <= ( z \ x )) implies x <= y))
proof
let x being (Element of X);
let y being (Element of X);
let z being (Element of X);
assume that
A6: x <= z
and
A7: ( z \ y ) <= ( z \ x );
( x \ z ) = ( 0. X ) by A6,BCIALG_1:def 11;

hence thesis by BCIALG_1:def 11;
