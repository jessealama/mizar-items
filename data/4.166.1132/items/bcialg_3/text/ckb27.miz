reserve X for BCK-algebra;
reserve x for (Element of X);
reserve y for (Element of X);
theorem
(for X being BCI-algebra holds (X is  BCI-commutative iff (for a being (Element of ( AtomSet X )) holds (for x,y being (Element of ( BranchV a )) holds ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) = ( y \ ( y \ x ) )))))
proof
let X being BCI-algebra;
thus (X is  BCI-commutative implies (for a being (Element of ( AtomSet X )) holds (for x,y being (Element of ( BranchV a )) holds ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) = ( y \ ( y \ x ) ))))
proof
assume A1: X is  BCI-commutative;
let a being (Element of ( AtomSet X ));
let x being (Element of ( BranchV a ));
let y being (Element of ( BranchV a ));
( y \ x ) in ( BranchV ( a \ a ) ) by BCIALG_1:39;
then (ex z1 being (Element of X) st (( y \ x ) = z1 & ( a \ a ) <= z1));
then ( 0. X ) <= ( y \ x ) by BCIALG_1:def 5;
then ( ( 0. X ) \ ( y \ x ) ) = ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:def 11;
then A2: ( ( y \ ( y \ x ) ) \ ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) ) = ( 0. X ) by A1,CKB26:1;
( x \ y ) in ( BranchV ( a \ a ) ) by BCIALG_1:39;
then (ex z being (Element of X) st (( x \ y ) = z & ( a \ a ) <= z));
then ( 0. X ) <= ( x \ y ) by BCIALG_1:def 5;
then ( ( 0. X ) \ ( x \ y ) ) = ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:def 11;
then ( ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) \ ( y \ ( y \ x ) ) ) = ( 0. X ) by A1,CKB26:1;
hence thesis by A2,BCIALG_1:def 7;
end;

assume A3: (for a being (Element of ( AtomSet X )) holds (for x,y being (Element of ( BranchV a )) holds ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) = ( y \ ( y \ x ) )));
(for x,y being (Element of X) holds (( x \ y ) = ( 0. X ) implies x = ( y \ ( y \ x ) )))
proof
let x being (Element of X);
let y being (Element of X);
set aa = ( ( 0. X ) \ ( ( 0. X ) \ x ) );
( ( aa ` ) ` ) = aa by BCIALG_1:8;
then A4: aa in ( AtomSet X ) by BCIALG_1:29;
A5: ( aa \ x ) = ( ( ( 0. X ) \ x ) \ ( ( 0. X ) \ x ) ) by BCIALG_1:7
.= ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:def 5;
then A6: aa <= x by BCIALG_1:def 11;
assume A7: ( x \ y ) = ( 0. X );
then ( aa \ y ) = ( 0. X ) by A5,BCIALG_1:3;
then aa <= y by BCIALG_1:def 11;
then consider aa being (Element of ( AtomSet X )) such that A8: (aa <= x & aa <= y) by A4,A6;
(x in ( BranchV aa ) & y in ( BranchV aa )) by A8;
then ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) = ( y \ ( y \ x ) ) by A3;
hence thesis by A7,BCIALG_1:2;
end;
hence thesis by CKB17:def 1;
