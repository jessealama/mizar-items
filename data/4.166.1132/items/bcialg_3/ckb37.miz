theorem
(for X being  bounded BCK-algebra holds (X is  involutory iff (for a being (Element of X) holds (a is  being_greatest implies (for x,y being (Element of X) holds (x <= ( a \ y ) implies y <= ( a \ x )))))))
proof
let X being  bounded BCK-algebra;
thus (X is  involutory implies (for a being (Element of X) holds (a is  being_greatest implies (for x,y being (Element of X) holds (x <= ( a \ y ) implies y <= ( a \ x ))))))
proof
assume A1: X is  involutory;
let a being (Element of X);
assume A2: a is  being_greatest;
let x being (Element of X),y being (Element of X);
assume x <= ( a \ y );
then ( x \ ( a \ y ) ) = ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:def 11;
then ( y \ ( a \ x ) ) = ( 0. X ) by A1,A2,CKB36:1;
hence thesis by BCIALG_1:def 11;
end;

assume A3: (for a being (Element of X) holds (a is  being_greatest implies (for x,y being (Element of X) holds (x <= ( a \ y ) implies y <= ( a \ x )))));
let a being (Element of X);
assume A4: a is  being_greatest;
let x being (Element of X);
( ( a \ x ) \ ( a \ x ) ) = ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:def 5;
then ( a \ x ) <= ( a \ x ) by BCIALG_1:def 11;
then x <= ( a \ ( a \ x ) ) by A3,A4;
then A5: ( x \ ( a \ ( a \ x ) ) ) = ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:def 11;
( ( a \ ( a \ x ) ) \ x ) = ( ( a \ x ) \ ( a \ x ) ) by BCIALG_1:7
.= ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:def 5;
hence thesis by A5,BCIALG_1:def 7;
