theorem
((M1 c= N & M2 c= N) implies (((((( 0. M1 ) = ( 0. M2 ) & ( 0. M1 ) in M2) & ((the carrier of M1) c= (the carrier of M2) implies M1 c= M2)) & ((for n holds (n in M1 implies n in M2)) implies M1 c= M2)) & ((((the carrier of M1) = (the carrier of M2) & M1 is  strict) & M2 is  strict) implies M1 = M2)) & ( (0). M1 ) c= M2))
proof
assume that
A1: M1 c= N
and
A2: M2 c= N;
thus ( 0. M1 ) = ( 0. M2 )
proof
reconsider M19 = M1,M29 = M2 as (Subspace of N) by A1,A2,CKB20:def 1;
( 0. M19 ) = ( 0. M29 ) by VECTSP_4:12;
hence thesis;
end;

thus ( 0. M1 ) in M2
proof
reconsider M19 = M1,M29 = M2 as (Subspace of N) by A1,A2,CKB20:def 1;
( 0. M19 ) in M29 by VECTSP_4:18;
hence thesis;
end;

thus ((the carrier of M1) c= (the carrier of M2) implies M1 c= M2)
proof
reconsider M19 = M1,M29 = M2 as (Subspace of N) by A1,A2,CKB20:def 1;
assume (the carrier of M1) c= (the carrier of M2);
then M19 is (Subspace of M29) by VECTSP_4:27;
hence thesis by CKB20:def 1;
end;

thus ((for n holds (n in M1 implies n in M2)) implies M1 c= M2)
proof
reconsider M19 = M1,M29 = M2 as (Subspace of N) by A1,A2,CKB20:def 1;
assume (for n holds (n in M1 implies n in M2));
then M19 is (Subspace of M29) by VECTSP_4:28;
hence thesis by CKB20:def 1;
end;

thus ((((the carrier of M1) = (the carrier of M2) & M1 is  strict) & M2 is  strict) implies M1 = M2)
proof

and
A4: M1 is  strict
and
