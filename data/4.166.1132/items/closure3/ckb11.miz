let I being set;
let M being (ManySortedSet of I);
let A being (SubsetFamily of M);
func MSUnion A -> (ManySortedSubset of M)
means
:Def4: (for i being set holds (i in I implies ( it . i ) = ( union { ( f . i ) where f is (Element of ( Bool M )): f in A } )));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
$2 = ( union { ( f . $1 ) where f is (Element of ( Bool M )): f in A } );
A1: (for x being set holds (x in I implies (ex y being set st P[ x,y ])));
consider IT being Function such that A2: ( dom IT ) = I and A3: (for x being set holds (x in I implies P[ x,( IT . x ) ])) from CLASSES1:sch 1(A1);
reconsider IT as (ManySortedSet of I) by A2,PARTFUN1:def 2,RELAT_1:def 18;
(for i being set holds (i in I implies ( IT . i ) c= ( M . i )))
proof
let i being set;
assume that
A4: i in I;
(for x being set holds (x in ( IT . i ) implies x in ( M . i )))
proof
let x being set;
assume A5: x in ( IT . i );
( IT . i ) = ( union { ( f . i ) where f is (Element of ( Bool M )): f in A } ) by A3,A4;
then consider Y being set such that A6: x in Y and A7: Y in { ( f . i ) where f is (Element of ( Bool M )): f in A } by A5,TARSKI:def 4;
consider ff being (Element of ( Bool M )) such that A8: ( ff . i ) = Y and ff in A by A7;
reconsider ff as (ManySortedSubset of M);
ff c= M by PBOOLE:def 18;
then ( ff . i ) c= ( M . i ) by A4,PBOOLE:def 2;
hence thesis by A6,A8;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 3;
end;
then IT c= M by PBOOLE:def 2;
then reconsider IT as (ManySortedSubset of M) by PBOOLE:def 18;
take IT;
thus thesis by A3;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let B1 being (ManySortedSubset of M),B2 being (ManySortedSubset of M);
assume that
A9: (for i being set holds (i in I implies ( B1 . i ) = ( union { ( f . i ) where f is (Element of ( Bool M )): f in A } )))
and
A10: (for i being set holds (i in I implies ( B2 . i ) = ( union { ( ff . i ) where ff is (Element of ( Bool M )): ff in A } )));
(for i being set holds (i in I implies ( B1 . i ) = ( B2 . i )))
proof
let i being set;
assume A11: i in I;
then ( B1 . i ) = ( union { ( f . i ) where f is (Element of ( Bool M )): f in A } ) by A9
.= ( B2 . i ) by A10,A11;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by PBOOLE:3;
