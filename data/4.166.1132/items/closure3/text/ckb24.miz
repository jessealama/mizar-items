theorem
Th16: (for S being non  void non  empty ManySortedSign holds (for MA being  strict  non-empty MSAlgebra over S holds ( SubSort MA ) is  absolutely-multiplicative  absolutely-multiplicative (SubsetFamily of (the Sorts of MA))))
proof
let S being non  void non  empty ManySortedSign;
let MA being  strict  non-empty MSAlgebra over S;
( SubSort MA ) c= ( Bool (the Sorts of MA) )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( SubSort MA );
then x is (ManySortedSubset of (the Sorts of MA)) by MSUALG_2:def 11;
hence thesis by CLOSURE2:def 1;
end;
then reconsider SUBMA = ( SubSort MA ) as (SubsetFamily of (the Sorts of MA));
(for F being (SubsetFamily of (the Sorts of MA)) holds (F c= SUBMA implies ( meet |: F :| ) in SUBMA))
proof
set M = ( bool ( Union (the Sorts of MA) ) );
set I = (the carrier of S);
let F being (SubsetFamily of (the Sorts of MA));
assume that
A1: F c= SUBMA;
set x = ( meet |: F :| );
A2: ( dom x ) = I by PARTFUN1:def 2;
( rng x ) c= M
proof
let u being set;
assume u in ( rng x );
then consider i being set such that A3: i in ( dom x ) and A4: u = ( x . i ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
( dom (the Sorts of MA) ) = I by PARTFUN1:def 2;
then ( (the Sorts of MA) . i ) in ( rng (the Sorts of MA) ) by A2,A3,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then A5: ( (the Sorts of MA) . i ) c= ( union ( rng (the Sorts of MA) ) ) by ZFMISC_1:74;
(ex Q being (Subset-Family of ( (the Sorts of MA) . i )) st (Q = ( |: F :| . i ) & u = ( Intersect Q ))) by A2,A3,A4,MSSUBFAM:def 1;
then u c= ( union ( rng (the Sorts of MA) ) ) by A5,XBOOLE_1:1;
then u in ( bool ( union ( rng (the Sorts of MA) ) ) );
hence thesis by CARD_3:def 4;
end;
then A6: x in ( Funcs (I,M) ) by A2,FUNCT_2:def 2;
reconsider x as (MSSubset of MA);
(for B being (MSSubset of MA) holds (B = x implies B is  opers_closed)) by A1,CKB4:1;
hence thesis by A6,MSUALG_2:def 11;

hence thesis by CLOSURE2:def 7;
