theorem
Th26: (((T is  paracompact & B is  closed) & (for x holds (x in B implies (ex V,W being (Subset of T) st ((((V is  open & W is  open) & A c= V) & x in W) & V misses W))))) implies (ex Y,Z being (Subset of T) st ((((Y is  open & Z is  open) & A c= Y) & B c= Z) & Y misses Z)))
proof
assume that
A1: T is  paracompact
and
A2: B is  closed
and
A3: (for x holds (x in B implies (ex V,W being (Subset of T) st ((((V is  open & W is  open) & A c= V) & x in W) & V misses W))));
defpred P[ set ]
 means
($1 = ( B ` ) or (ex V,W being (Subset of T) st (ex x st ((((((x in B & $1 = W) & V is  open) & W is  open) & A c= V) & x in W) & V misses W))));
consider GX such that A4: (for X being (Subset of T) holds (X in GX iff P[ X ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
now
let x;
assume x in ( [#] T );
then A5: x in ( B \/ ( B ` ) ) by PRE_TOPC:2;
now
per cases  by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A6: x in B;

(ex X st (x in X & X in GX))
proof
consider V,W being (Subset of T) such that A7: ((V is  open & W is  open) & A c= V) and A8: x in W and A9: V misses W by A3,A6;
take X = W;
thus x in X by A8;
thus thesis by A4,A6,A7,A8,A9;
end;
hence x in ( union GX ) by TARSKI:def 4;
end;
suppose A10: x in ( B ` );

(ex X st (x in X & X in GX))
proof
take X = ( B ` );
thus x in X by A10;
thus thesis by A4;
end;
hence x in ( union GX ) by TARSKI:def 4;
end;
end;
hence x in ( union GX );
end;
then ( [#] T ) c= ( union GX ) by SUBSET_1:2;
then ( [#] T ) = ( union GX ) by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then A11: GX is (Cover of T) by SETFAM_1:45;
(for X being (Subset of T) holds (X in GX implies X is  open))
proof
let X being (Subset of T);
assume A12: X in GX;
now
per cases  by A4,A12;
suppose X = ( B ` );

hence thesis by A2;
end;
suppose (ex V,W being (Subset of T) st (ex y st ((((((y in B & X = W) & V is  open) & W is  open) & A c= V) & y in W) & V misses W)));

hence thesis;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
then GX is  open by TOPS_2:def 1;
then consider FX such that A13: FX is  open and A14: FX is (Cover of T) and A15: FX is_finer_than GX and A16: FX is  locally_finite by A1,A11,CKB25:def 1;
set HX = { W: (W in FX & W meets B) };
A17: HX c= FX by CKB9:1;
reconsider HX as (Subset-Family of T) by CKB9:1,TOPS_2:2;
take Y = ( ( union ( clf HX ) ) ` );
take Z = ( union HX );
( union ( clf HX ) ) = ( Cl ( union HX ) ) by A16,A17,CKB10:1,CKB23:1;
hence Y is  open;
thus Z is  open by A13,A17,TOPS_2:11,TOPS_2:19;
A18: (for X holds (X in HX implies ( A /\ ( Cl X ) ) = ( {} )))
proof
let X;
assume X in HX;
then A19: (ex W st ((W = X & W in FX) & W meets B));
then consider Y being set such that A20: Y in GX and A21: X c= Y by A15,SETFAM_1:def 2;
reconsider Y as (Subset of T) by A20;
now
per cases  by A4,A20;
suppose Y = ( B ` );

hence thesis by A19,A21,XBOOLE_1:63,XBOOLE_1:79;
end;
suppose (ex V,W being (Subset of T) st (ex y st ((((((y in B & Y = W) & V is  open) & W is  open) & A c= V) & y in W) & V misses W)));

then consider V,W being (Subset of T),y such that y in B and A22: Y = W and A23: V is  open and W is  open and A24: A c= V and y in W and A25: V misses W;
V misses X by A21,A22,A25,XBOOLE_1:63;
then ( Cl ( V /\ X ) ) = ( Cl ( {} T ) ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then ( Cl ( V /\ X ) ) = ( {} ) by PRE_TOPC:22;
then ( Cl ( V /\ ( Cl X ) ) ) = ( {} ) by A23,TOPS_1:14;
then ( V /\ ( Cl X ) ) = ( {} ) by CKB2:1;

then A misses ( Cl X ) by A24,XBOOLE_1:63;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
A misses ( union ( clf HX ) )
proof
assume A meets ( union ( clf HX ) );
then consider x being set such that A26: x in A and A27: x in ( union ( clf HX ) ) by XBOOLE_0:3;
reconsider x as (Point of T) by A26;
now
assume x in ( union ( clf HX ) );
then consider X being set such that A28: x in X and A29: X in ( clf HX ) by TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider X as (Subset of T) by A29;
(ex W st (X = ( Cl W ) & W in HX)) by A29,CKB12:def 1;
then ( A /\ X ) = ( {} ) by A18;
then A misses X by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
hence (not x in A) by A28,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
hence thesis by A26,A27;
end;
hence A c= Y by SUBSET_1:23;
now
let y;
assume A30: y in B;
(ex W st (y in W & W in HX))
proof
consider W such that A31: y in W and A32: W in FX by A14,CKB3:1;
take W;
thus y in W by A31;
W meets B by A30,A31,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A32;
end;
hence y in Z by TARSKI:def 4;
end;
hence B c= Z by SUBSET_1:2;
Z c= ( Y ` ) by CKB19:1,SETFAM_1:13;
hence Y misses Z by SUBSET_1:23;
end;
