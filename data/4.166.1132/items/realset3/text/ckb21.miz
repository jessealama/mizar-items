definition
let F being Field;
func ovf F -> (Function of [: (the carrier of F),( NonZero F ) :],(the carrier of F))
means
:Def2: (for x being (Element of F) holds (for y being (Element of ( NonZero F )) holds ( it . (x,y) ) = ( ( omf F ) . (x,( ( revf F ) . y )) )));
existence
proof
defpred P[ (Element of F),(Element of ( NonZero F )),set ]
 means
$3 = ( ( omf F ) . ($1,( ( revf F ) . $2 )) );
now
let x being (Element of F);
let y being (Element of ( NonZero F ));
( ( revf F ) . y ) is (Element of F) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then reconsider z = ( ( omf F ) . (x,( ( revf F ) . y )) ) as (Element of F) by REALSET2:10;
take z;
thus z = ( ( omf F ) . (x,( ( revf F ) . y )) );
end;
then A1: (for x being (Element of F) holds (for y being (Element of ( NonZero F )) holds (ex z being (Element of F) st P[ x,y,z ])));
(ex f being (Function of [: (the carrier of F),( NonZero F ) :],(the carrier of F)) st (for x being (Element of F) holds (for y being (Element of ( NonZero F )) holds P[ x,y,( f . (x,y) ) ]))) from BINOP_1:sch 3(A1);
hence thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let S1 being (Function of [: (the carrier of F),( NonZero F ) :],(the carrier of F)),S2 being (Function of [: (the carrier of F),( NonZero F ) :],(the carrier of F));
assume that
A2: (for x being (Element of F) holds (for y being (Element of ( NonZero F )) holds ( S1 . (x,y) ) = ( ( omf F ) . (x,( ( revf F ) . y )) )))
and
A3: (for x being (Element of F) holds (for y being (Element of ( NonZero F )) holds ( S2 . (x,y) ) = ( ( omf F ) . (x,( ( revf F ) . y )) )));
now
let p being set;
assume p in [: (the carrier of F),( NonZero F ) :];
then consider x being set,y being set such that A4: (x in (the carrier of F) & y in ( NonZero F )) and A5: p = [ x,y ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
( S1 . (x,y) ) = ( ( omf F ) . (x,( ( revf F ) . y )) ) by A2,A4
.= ( S2 . (x,y) ) by A3,A4;
hence ( S1 . p ) = ( S2 . p ) by A5;
end;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:12;
end;
