theorem
(for F being Field holds (for a,b being (Element of F) holds (for c,d being (Element of ( NonZero F )) holds ( (the addF of F) . (( ( omf F ) . (a,( ( revf F ) . c )) ),( ( omf F ) . (b,( ( revf F ) . d )) )) ) = ( ( omf F ) . (( (the addF of F) . (( ( omf F ) . (a,d) ),( ( omf F ) . (b,c) )) ),( ( revf F ) . ( ( omf F ) . (c,d) ) )) ))))
proof
let F being Field;
let a being (Element of F),b being (Element of F);
let c being (Element of ( NonZero F )),d being (Element of ( NonZero F ));
