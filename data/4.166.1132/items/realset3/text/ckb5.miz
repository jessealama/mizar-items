theorem
Th8: (for F being Field holds (for a,c being (Element of F) holds (for b,d being (Element of ( NonZero F )) holds (( ( omf F ) . (a,( ( revf F ) . b )) ) = ( ( omf F ) . (c,( ( revf F ) . d )) ) iff ( ( omf F ) . (a,d) ) = ( ( omf F ) . (b,c) )))))
proof
let F being Field;
let a being (Element of F),c being (Element of F);
let b being (Element of ( NonZero F )),d being (Element of ( NonZero F ));
A1: (( ( omf F ) . (a,( ( revf F ) . b )) ) = ( ( omf F ) . (c,( ( revf F ) . d )) ) implies ( ( omf F ) . (a,d) ) = ( ( omf F ) . (b,c) ))
proof
reconsider revfb = ( ( revf F ) . b ),revfd = ( ( revf F ) . d ) as (Element of ( NonZero F ));
reconsider crevfd = ( c * revfd ) as (Element of F);
assume A2: ( ( omf F ) . (a,( ( revf F ) . b )) ) = ( ( omf F ) . (c,( ( revf F ) . d )) );
A3: c = ( c * ( 1. F ) ) by REALSET2:21
.= ( ( omf F ) . (c,( d * revfd )) ) by REALSET2:def 6
.= ( c * ( revfd * d ) )
.= ( ( c * revfd ) * d ) by REALSET2:19;
a = ( a * ( 1. F ) ) by REALSET2:21
.= ( ( omf F ) . (a,( b * revfb )) ) by REALSET2:def 6
.= ( a * ( revfb * b ) )
.= ( ( a * revfb ) * b ) by REALSET2:19
.= ( b * crevfd ) by A2
.= ( ( omf F ) . (b,( ( omf F ) . (c,( ( revf F ) . d )) )) );
hence ( ( omf F ) . (a,d) ) = ( ( b * ( c * revfd ) ) * d )
.= ( b * ( ( c * revfd ) * d ) ) by REALSET2:19
.= ( ( omf F ) . (b,c) ) by A3;
end;
(( ( omf F ) . (a,d) ) = ( ( omf F ) . (b,c) ) implies ( ( omf F ) . (a,( ( revf F ) . b )) ) = ( ( omf F ) . (c,( ( revf F ) . d )) ))
proof
reconsider revfd = ( ( revf F ) . d ),revfb = ( ( revf F ) . b ) as (Element of ( NonZero F ));
reconsider crevfd = ( ( omf F ) . (c,revfd) ) as (Element of F);
assume A4: ( ( omf F ) . (a,d) ) = ( ( omf F ) . (b,c) );
a = ( a * ( 1. F ) ) by REALSET2:21
.= ( ( omf F ) . (a,( 1. F )) )
.= ( a * ( d * revfd ) ) by REALSET2:def 6
.= ( ( a * d ) * revfd ) by REALSET2:19
.= ( ( b * c ) * revfd ) by A4
.= ( b * ( c * revfd ) ) by REALSET2:19
.= ( crevfd * b );
hence ( ( omf F ) . (a,( ( revf F ) . b )) ) = ( ( crevfd * b ) * revfb )
.= ( crevfd * ( b * revfb ) ) by REALSET2:19
.= ( ( ( omf F ) . (c,revfd) ) * ( 1. F ) ) by REALSET2:def 6
.= ( ( omf F ) . (c,( ( revf F ) . d )) ) by REALSET2:21;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
