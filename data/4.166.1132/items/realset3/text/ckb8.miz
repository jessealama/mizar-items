begin
definition
let F being Field;
func osf F -> (BinOp of (the carrier of F))
means
:Def1: (for x,y being (Element of F) holds ( it . (x,y) ) = ( (the addF of F) . (x,( ( comp F ) . y )) ));
existence
proof
defpred P[ (Element of F),(Element of F),set ]
 means
$3 = ( (the addF of F) . ($1,( ( comp F ) . $2 )) );
A1: (for x being (Element of F) holds (for y being (Element of F) holds (ex z being (Element of F) st P[ x,y,z ])));
(ex f being (BinOp of (the carrier of F)) st (for x being (Element of F) holds (for y being (Element of F) holds P[ x,y,( f . (x,y) ) ]))) from BINOP_1:sch 3(A1);
then consider S being (BinOp of (the carrier of F)) such that A2: (for x,y being (Element of F) holds ( S . (x,y) ) = ( (the addF of F) . (x,( ( comp F ) . y )) ));
take S;
thus thesis by A2;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let S1 being (BinOp of (the carrier of F)),S2 being (BinOp of (the carrier of F));
assume that
A3: (for x,y being (Element of F) holds ( S1 . (x,y) ) = ( (the addF of F) . (x,( ( comp F ) . y )) ))
and
A4: (for x,y being (Element of F) holds ( S2 . (x,y) ) = ( (the addF of F) . (x,( ( comp F ) . y )) ));
now
let p being set;
assume p in [: (the carrier of F),(the carrier of F) :];
then consider x being set,y being set such that A5: (x in (the carrier of F) & y in (the carrier of F)) and A6: p = [ x,y ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
thus ( S1 . p ) = ( S1 . (x,y) ) by A6
.= ( (the addF of F) . (x,( ( comp F ) . y )) ) by A3,A5
.= ( S2 . (x,y) ) by A4,A5
.= ( S2 . p ) by A6;
end;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:12;
end;
