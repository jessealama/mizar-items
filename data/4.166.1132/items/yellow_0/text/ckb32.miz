theorem
Th14: (for L1,L2 being RelStr holds (( the RelStr of L1 ) = ( the RelStr of L2 ) implies (for X being set holds (( ex_sup_of X,L1 implies  ex_sup_of X,L2) & ( ex_inf_of X,L1 implies  ex_inf_of X,L2)))))
proof
let L1 being RelStr;
let L2 being RelStr;
assume that
A1: ( the RelStr of L1 ) = ( the RelStr of L2 );
let X being set;
thus ( ex_sup_of X,L1 implies  ex_sup_of X,L2)
proof
given a being (Element of L1) such that
A2: X is_<=_than a
and
A3: (for b being (Element of L1) holds (X is_<=_than b implies b >= a))
and
A4: (for c being (Element of L1) holds ((X is_<=_than c & (for b being (Element of L1) holds (X is_<=_than b implies b >= c))) implies c = a));

reconsider a9 = a as (Element of L2) by A1;
take a9;
thus X is_<=_than a9 by A1,A2,CKB10:1;
hereby
let b9 being (Element of L2);
reconsider b = b9 as (Element of L1) by A1;
assume X is_<=_than b9;
then b >= a by A1,A3,CKB10:1;
hence b9 >= a9 by A1,CKB9:1;
end;
let c9 being (Element of L2);
reconsider c = c9 as (Element of L1) by A1;
assume X is_<=_than c9;
then A5: X is_<=_than c by A1,CKB10:1;
assume A6: (for b9 being (Element of L2) holds (X is_<=_than b9 implies b9 >= c9));
now
let b being (Element of L1);
reconsider b9 = b as (Element of L2) by A1;
assume X is_<=_than b;
then b9 >= c9 by A1,A6,CKB10:1;
hence b >= c by A1,CKB9:1;
end;
hence thesis by A4,A5;
end;

given a being (Element of L1) such that
A7: X is_>=_than a
and
A8: (for b being (Element of L1) holds (X is_>=_than b implies b <= a))
and
A9: (for c being (Element of L1) holds ((X is_>=_than c & (for b being (Element of L1) holds (X is_>=_than b implies b <= c))) implies c = a));

reconsider a9 = a as (Element of L2) by A1;
take a9;
thus X is_>=_than a9 by A1,A7,CKB10:1;
hereby
let b9 being (Element of L2);
reconsider b = b9 as (Element of L1) by A1;
assume X is_>=_than b9;
then b <= a by A1,A8,CKB10:1;
hence b9 <= a9 by A1,CKB9:1;
end;
let c9 being (Element of L2);
reconsider c = c9 as (Element of L1) by A1;
assume A10: X is_>=_than c9;
assume A11: (for b9 being (Element of L2) holds (X is_>=_than b9 implies b9 <= c9));
A12:now
let b being (Element of L1);
reconsider b9 = b as (Element of L2) by A1;
assume X is_>=_than b;
then b9 <= c9 by A1,A11,CKB10:1;
hence b <= c by A1,CKB9:1;
end;
X is_>=_than c by A1,A10,CKB10:1;
hence thesis by A9,A12;
