let V being RealUnitarySpace;
let W1 being (Subspace of V);
let W2 being (Subspace of V);
func W1 + W2 ->  strict (Subspace of V) means 
:Def1: (the carrier of it) = { ( v + u ) where v is (VECTOR of V),u is (VECTOR of V): (v in W1 & u in W2) };
existence
proof
reconsider V1 = (the carrier of W1),V2 = (the carrier of W2) as (Subset of V) by RUSUB_1:def 1;
set VS = { ( v + u ) where v is (VECTOR of V),u is (VECTOR of V): (v in W1 & u in W2) };
VS c= (the carrier of V)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in VS;
then (ex v1,v2 being (VECTOR of V) st ((x = ( v1 + v2 ) & v1 in W1) & v2 in W2));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider VS as (Subset of V);
A1: ( 0. V ) = ( ( 0. V ) + ( 0. V ) ) by RLVECT_1:4;
(( 0. V ) in W1 & ( 0. V ) in W2) by RUSUB_1:11;
then A2: ( 0. V ) in VS by A1;
A3: VS = { ( v + u ) where v is (VECTOR of V),u is (VECTOR of V): (v in V1 & u in V2) }
proof
thus VS c= { ( v + u ) where v is (VECTOR of V),u is (VECTOR of V): (v in V1 & u in V2) }
proof
let x being set;
assume x in VS;
then consider v,u being (VECTOR of V) such that A4: x = ( v + u ) and A5: (v in W1 & u in W2);
(v in V1 & u in V2) by A5,STRUCT_0:def 5;
hence thesis by A4;
end;

let x being set;
assume x in { ( v + u ) where v is (VECTOR of V),u is (VECTOR of V): (v in V1 & u in V2) };
then consider v,u being (VECTOR of V) such that A6: x = ( v + u ) and A7: (v in V1 & u in V2);
(v in W1 & u in W2) by A7,STRUCT_0:def 5;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
(V1 is  linearly-closed & V2 is  linearly-closed) by RUSUB_1:28;
hence thesis by A2,A3,RLSUB_1:6,RUSUB_1:29;
end;
uniqueness by RUSUB_1:24;
