theorem
Lm3: (for V being RealUnitarySpace holds (for W1 being (Subspace of V) holds (for W2 being  strict (Subspace of V) holds ((the carrier of W1) c= (the carrier of W2) implies ( W1 + W2 ) = W2))))
proof
let V being RealUnitarySpace;
let W1 being (Subspace of V);
let W2 being  strict (Subspace of V);
assume A1: (the carrier of W1) c= (the carrier of W2);
A2: (the carrier of ( W1 + W2 )) c= (the carrier of W2)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of ( W1 + W2 ));
then x in { ( v + u ) where v is (VECTOR of V),u is (VECTOR of V): (v in W1 & u in W2) } by CKB1:def 1;
then consider v,u being (VECTOR of V) such that A3: x = ( v + u ) and A4: v in W1 and A5: u in W2;
W1 is (Subspace of W2) by A1,RUSUB_1:22;
then v in W2 by A4,RUSUB_1:1;
then ( v + u ) in W2 by A5,RUSUB_1:14;
hence thesis by A3,STRUCT_0:def 5;
end;
( W1 + W2 ) = ( W2 + W1 ) by CKB6:1;
then (the carrier of W2) c= (the carrier of ( W1 + W2 )) by CKB7:1;
then (the carrier of ( W1 + W2 )) = (the carrier of W2) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by RUSUB_1:24;
end;
