definition
let V being RealUnitarySpace;
func Subspaces V -> set means 
:Def3: (for x being set holds (x in it iff x is  strict  strict (Subspace of V)));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(ex W being  strict (Subspace of V) st ($2 = W & $1 = (the carrier of W)));
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex W being  strict (Subspace of V) st $1 = (the carrier of W));
consider B being set such that A1: (for x being set holds (x in B iff (x in ( bool (the carrier of V) ) & P[ x ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
A2: (for x,y1,y2 being set holds ((P[ x,y1 ] & P[ x,y2 ]) implies y1 = y2)) by RUSUB_1:24;
consider f being Function such that A3: (for x,y being set holds ([ x,y ] in f iff (x in B & P[ x,y ]))) from FUNCT_1:sch 1(A2);
(for x being set holds (x in B iff (ex y being set st [ x,y ] in f)))
proof
let x being set;
thus (x in B implies (ex y being set st [ x,y ] in f))
proof
assume A4: x in B;
then consider W being  strict (Subspace of V) such that A5: x = (the carrier of W) by A1;
reconsider y = W as set;
take y;
thus thesis by A3,A4,A5;
end;

given y being set such that
A6: [ x,y ] in f;

thus thesis by A3,A6;
end;
then A7: B = ( dom f ) by RELAT_1:def 4;
(for y being set holds (y in ( rng f ) iff y is  strict  strict (Subspace of V)))
proof
let y being set;
thus (y in ( rng f ) implies y is  strict  strict (Subspace of V))
proof
assume y in ( rng f );
then consider x being set such that A8: (x in ( dom f ) & y = ( f . x )) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
[ x,y ] in f by A8,FUNCT_1:def 2;
then (ex W being  strict (Subspace of V) st (y = W & x = (the carrier of W))) by A3;
hence thesis;
end;

assume y is  strict  strict (Subspace of V);
then reconsider W = y as  strict (Subspace of V);
reconsider x = (the carrier of W) as set;
(the carrier of W) c= (the carrier of V) by RUSUB_1:def 1;
then A9: x in ( dom f ) by A1,A7;
then [ x,y ] in f by A3,A7;
then y = ( f . x ) by A9,FUNCT_1:def 2;
hence thesis by A9,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let D1 being set;
let D2 being set;
assume A10: (for x being set holds (x in D1 iff x is  strict  strict (Subspace of V)));
assume A11: (for x being set holds (x in D2 iff x is  strict  strict (Subspace of V)));
now
let x being set;
thus (x in D1 implies x in D2)
proof
assume x in D1;
then x is  strict  strict (Subspace of V) by A10;
hence thesis by A11;
end;

assume x in D2;
then x is  strict  strict (Subspace of V) by A11;
hence x in D1 by A10;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
