theorem
Lm9: (for V being RealUnitarySpace holds (for W1,W2,W3 being (Subspace of V) holds (W1 is (Subspace of W2) implies (the carrier of ( W2 /\ ( W1 + W3 ) )) = (the carrier of ( ( W1 /\ W2 ) + ( W2 /\ W3 ) )))))
proof
let V being RealUnitarySpace;
let W1 being (Subspace of V),W2 being (Subspace of V),W3 being (Subspace of V);
assume A1: W1 is (Subspace of W2);
thus (the carrier of ( W2 /\ ( W1 + W3 ) )) c= (the carrier of ( ( W1 /\ W2 ) + ( W2 /\ W3 ) ))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of ( W2 /\ ( W1 + W3 ) ));
then A2: x in ( (the carrier of W2) /\ (the carrier of ( W1 + W3 )) ) by CKB2:def 1;
then x in (the carrier of ( W1 + W3 )) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then x in { ( u + v ) where u is (VECTOR of V),v is (VECTOR of V): (u in W1 & v in W3) } by CKB1:def 1;
then consider u1 being (VECTOR of V),v1 being (VECTOR of V) such that A3: x = ( u1 + v1 ) and A4: u1 in W1 and A5: v1 in W3;
A6: u1 in W2 by A1,A4,RUSUB_1:1;
x in (the carrier of W2) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then ( u1 + v1 ) in W2 by A3,STRUCT_0:def 5;
then ( ( v1 + u1 ) - u1 ) in W2 by A6,RUSUB_1:17;
then ( v1 + ( u1 - u1 ) ) in W2 by RLVECT_1:def 3;
then ( v1 + ( 0. V ) ) in W2 by RLVECT_1:15;
then v1 in W2 by RLVECT_1:4;
then A7: v1 in ( W2 /\ W3 ) by A5,CKB5:1;
u1 in ( W1 /\ W2 ) by A4,A6,CKB5:1;
then x in ( ( W1 /\ W2 ) + ( W2 /\ W3 ) ) by A3,A7,CKB3:1;
hence thesis by STRUCT_0:def 5;
end;

thus thesis by CKB34:1;
end;
