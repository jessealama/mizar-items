theorem
Th6: (for V being RealUnitarySpace holds (for W1,W2,W3 being (Subspace of V) holds ( W1 + ( W2 + W3 ) ) = ( ( W1 + W2 ) + W3 )))
proof
let V being RealUnitarySpace;
let W1 being (Subspace of V),W2 being (Subspace of V),W3 being (Subspace of V);
set A = { ( v + u ) where v is (VECTOR of V),u is (VECTOR of V): (v in W1 & u in W2) };
set B = { ( v + u ) where v is (VECTOR of V),u is (VECTOR of V): (v in W2 & u in W3) };
set C = { ( v + u ) where v is (VECTOR of V),u is (VECTOR of V): (v in ( W1 + W2 ) & u in W3) };
set D = { ( v + u ) where v is (VECTOR of V),u is (VECTOR of V): (v in W1 & u in ( W2 + W3 )) };
A1: (the carrier of ( W1 + ( W2 + W3 ) )) = D by CKB1:def 1;
A2: C c= D
proof
let x being set;
assume x in C;
then consider v being (VECTOR of V),u being (VECTOR of V) such that A3: x = ( v + u ) and A4: v in ( W1 + W2 ) and A5: u in W3;
v in (the carrier of ( W1 + W2 )) by A4,STRUCT_0:def 5;
then v in A by CKB1:def 1;
then consider u1 being (VECTOR of V),u2 being (VECTOR of V) such that A6: v = ( u1 + u2 ) and A7: u1 in W1 and A8: u2 in W2;
( u2 + u ) in B by A5,A8;
then ( u2 + u ) in (the carrier of ( W2 + W3 )) by CKB1:def 1;
then A9: ( u2 + u ) in ( W2 + W3 ) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
( v + u ) = ( u1 + ( u2 + u ) ) by A6,RLVECT_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A3,A7,A9;
end;
D c= C
proof
let x being set;
assume x in D;
then consider v being (VECTOR of V),u being (VECTOR of V) such that A10: x = ( v + u ) and A11: v in W1 and A12: u in ( W2 + W3 );
u in (the carrier of ( W2 + W3 )) by A12,STRUCT_0:def 5;
then u in B by CKB1:def 1;
then consider u1 being (VECTOR of V),u2 being (VECTOR of V) such that A13: u = ( u1 + u2 ) and A14: u1 in W2 and A15: u2 in W3;
( v + u1 ) in A by A11,A14;
then ( v + u1 ) in (the carrier of ( W1 + W2 )) by CKB1:def 1;
then A16: ( v + u1 ) in ( W1 + W2 ) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
( v + u ) = ( ( v + u1 ) + u2 ) by A13,RLVECT_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A10,A15,A16;
end;
then D = C by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by A1,CKB1:def 1;
