theorem
Lm1: (MS is  satisfying_PAP iff ( Af MS ) is  Pappian)
proof
set AS = ( Af MS );
A1:now
assume A2: MS is  satisfying_PAP;
now
let M being (Subset of AS),N being (Subset of AS);
let o being (Element of AS),a being (Element of AS),b being (Element of AS),c being (Element of AS),a9 being (Element of AS),b9 being (Element of AS),c9 being (Element of AS);
assume that
A3: (M is  being_line & N is  being_line)
and
A4: M <> N
and
A5: (o in M & o in N)
and
A6: o <> a
and
A7: (o <> a9 & o <> b)
and
A8: (((o <> b9 & o <> c) & o <> c9) & a in M)
and
A9: b in M
and
A10: c in M
and
A11: a9 in N
and
A12: (b9 in N & c9 in N)
and
A13: a,b9 // b,a9
and
A14: b,c9 // c,b9;
reconsider M9 = M,N9 = N as (Subset of MS) by ANALMETR:42;
reconsider a1 = a,b1 = b,c1 = c,a19 = a9,b19 = b9,c19 = c9 as (Element of MS) by ANALMETR:35;
A15: b1,c19 // c1,b19 by A14,ANALMETR:36;
a1,b19 // b1,a19 by A13,ANALMETR:36;
then A16: b1,a19 // a1,b19 by ANALMETR:59;
A17: (M9 is  being_line & N9 is  being_line) by A3,ANALMETR:43;
then ((not a19 in M9) & (not b1 in N9)) by A4,A5,A7,A9,A11,CONMETR:5;
then c1,a19 // a1,c19 by A2,A5,A6,A8,A9,A10,A11,A12,A17,A16,A15,CONMETR:def 2;
then a1,c19 // c1,a19 by ANALMETR:59;
hence a,c9 // c,a9 by ANALMETR:36;
end;
hence ( Af MS ) is  Pappian by AFF_2:def 2;
end;
now
assume A18: ( Af MS ) is  Pappian;
now
let o being (Element of MS),a1 being (Element of MS),a2 being (Element of MS),a3 being (Element of MS),b1 being (Element of MS),b2 being (Element of MS),b3 being (Element of MS);
let M being (Subset of (the carrier of MS)),N being (Subset of (the carrier of MS));
assume that
A19: (M is  being_line & N is  being_line)
and
A20: (((((((((((o in M & a1 in M) & a2 in M) & a3 in M) & o in N) & b1 in N) & b2 in N) & b3 in N) & (not b2 in M)) & (not a3 in N)) & o <> a1) & o <> a2)
and
o <> a3
and
A21: o <> b1
and
o <> b2
and
A22: o <> b3
and
A23: a3,b2 // a2,b1
and
A24: a3,b3 // a1,b1;
reconsider M9 = M,N9 = N as (Subset of AS) by ANALMETR:42;
reconsider a = a1,b = a2,c = a3,a9 = b1,b9 = b2,c9 = b3 as (Element of AS) by ANALMETR:35;
A25: c,c9 // a,a9 by A24,ANALMETR:36;
a2,b1 // a3,b2 by A23,ANALMETR:59;
then A26: b,a9 // c,b9 by ANALMETR:36;
(M9 is  being_line & N9 is  being_line) by A19,ANALMETR:43;
then b,c9 // a,b9 by A18,A20,A21,A22,A26,A25,AFF_2:def 2;
then a2,b3 // a1,b2 by ANALMETR:36;
hence a1,b2 // a2,b3 by ANALMETR:59;
end;
hence MS is  satisfying_PAP by CONMETR:def 2;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
