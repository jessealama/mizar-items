theorem
Th5: (for a,b,c being (Element of MS) holds ((not  LIN a,b,c) implies (ex d being (Element of MS) st (d,a _|_ b,c & d,b _|_ a,c))))
proof
let a being (Element of MS);
let b being (Element of MS);
let c being (Element of MS);
set A = ( Line (a,c) );
set K = ( Line (b,c) );
reconsider A9 = A,K9 = K as (Subset of ( Af MS )) by ANALMETR:42;
reconsider a9 = a,b9 = b,c9 = c as (Element of ( Af MS )) by ANALMETR:35;
K9 = ( Line (b9,c9) ) by ANALMETR:41;
then A1: (b9 in K9 & c9 in K9) by AFF_1:15;
assume A2: (not  LIN a,b,c);
then a <> c by CKB8:1;
then A is  being_line by ANALMETR:def 12;
then consider P being (Subset of MS) such that A3: b in P and A4: A _|_ P by CONMETR:3;
b <> c by A2,CKB8:1;
then K is  being_line by ANALMETR:def 12;
then consider Q being (Subset of MS) such that A5: a in Q and A6: K _|_ Q by CONMETR:3;
reconsider P9 = P,Q9 = Q as (Subset of ( Af MS )) by ANALMETR:42;
Q is  being_line by A6,ANALMETR:44;
then A7: Q9 is  being_line by ANALMETR:43;
A8: A9 = ( Line (a9,c9) ) by ANALMETR:41;
then A9: c9 in A9 by AFF_1:15;
A10: (not P9 // Q9)
proof
assume (not thesis);
then P // Q by ANALMETR:46;
then A _|_ Q by A4,ANALMETR:52;
then A // K by A6,ANALMETR:65;
then A9 // K9 by ANALMETR:46;
then b9 in A9 by A9,A1,AFF_1:45;
then  LIN a9,c9,b9 by A8,AFF_1:def 2;
then  LIN a9,b9,c9 by AFF_1:6;
hence contradiction by A2,ANALMETR:40;
end;
P is  being_line by A4,ANALMETR:44;
then P9 is  being_line by ANALMETR:43;
then consider d9 being (Element of ( Af MS )) such that A11: (d9 in P9 & d9 in Q9) by A7,A10,AFF_1:58;
reconsider d = d9 as (Element of MS) by ANALMETR:35;
take d;
a9 in A9 by A8,AFF_1:15;
hence thesis by A3,A4,A5,A6,A9,A1,A11,ANALMETR:56;
