theorem
(for o,c,c1,a being (Element of MS) holds ((not  LIN o,c,a) implies (ex a1 being (Element of MS) st (o,a _|_ o,a1 & c,a _|_ c1,a1))))
proof
let o being (Element of MS),c being (Element of MS),c1 being (Element of MS),a being (Element of MS);
assume that
A1: (not  LIN o,c,a);
set X = ( Line (c,a) );
set Y = ( Line (o,a) );
c <> a by A1,CKB8:1;
then A2: X is  being_line by ANALMETR:def 12;
then consider X9 being (Subset of MS) such that A3: c1 in X9 and A4: X _|_ X9 by CONMETR:3;
o <> a by A1,CKB8:1;
then Y is  being_line by ANALMETR:def 12;
then consider Y9 being (Subset of MS) such that A5: o in Y9 and A6: Y _|_ Y9 by CONMETR:3;
reconsider X1 = X9,Y1 = Y9 as (Subset of ( Af MS )) by ANALMETR:42;
Y9 is  being_line by A6,ANALMETR:44;
then A7: Y1 is  being_line by ANALMETR:43;
reconsider o9 = o,c9 = c,a9 = a as (Element of ( Af MS )) by ANALMETR:35;
A8: X = ( Line (c9,a9) ) by ANALMETR:41;
then A9: a in X by AFF_1:15;
Y = ( Line (o9,a9) ) by ANALMETR:41;
then A10: (o in Y & a in Y) by AFF_1:15;
A11: c in X by A8,AFF_1:15;
(not X9 // Y9)
proof
reconsider X1 = X,Y1 = Y as (Subset of (the carrier of ( Af MS ))) by ANALMETR:42;
assume (not thesis);
then X9 _|_ Y by A6,ANALMETR:52;
then X // Y by A4,ANALMETR:65;
then X1 // Y1 by ANALMETR:46;
then A12: o in X by A9,A10,AFF_1:45;
a in X by A8,AFF_1:15;
hence contradiction by A1,A2,A11,A12,CONMETR:4;
end;
then A13: (not X1 // Y1) by ANALMETR:46;
X9 is  being_line by A4,ANALMETR:44;
then X1 is  being_line by ANALMETR:43;
then consider a19 being (Element of ( Af MS )) such that A14: (a19 in X1 & a19 in Y1) by A7,A13,AFF_1:58;
reconsider a1 = a19 as (Element of MS) by ANALMETR:35;
take a1;
thus thesis by A3,A4,A5,A6,A11,A9,A10,A14,ANALMETR:56;
