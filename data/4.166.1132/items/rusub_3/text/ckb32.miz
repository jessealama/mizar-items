theorem
Th25: (for V being RealUnitarySpace holds (for A being (Subset of V) holds (A is  linearly-independent implies (for v being (VECTOR of V) holds (v in A implies (for B being (Subset of V) holds (B = ( A \ { v } ) implies (not v in ( Lin B )))))))))
proof
let V being RealUnitarySpace;
let A being (Subset of V);
assume that
A1: A is  linearly-independent;
let v being (VECTOR of V);
assume v in A;
then A2: { v } is (Subset of A) by SUBSET_1:41;
let B being (Subset of V);
assume that
A3: B = ( A \ { v } );
B c= A by A3,XBOOLE_1:36;
then A4: ( B \/ { v } ) c= ( A \/ A ) by A2,XBOOLE_1:13;
assume v in ( Lin B );
then consider L being (Linear_Combination of B) such that A5: v = ( Sum L ) by CKB2:1;
{ v } is  linearly-independent by A1,A2,RLVECT_3:5;
then v <> ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_3:8;
then ( Carrier L ) is non empty by A5,RLVECT_2:34;
then A6: (ex w being set st w in ( Carrier L )) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
v in { v } by TARSKI:def 1;
then v in ( Lin { v } ) by CKB3:1;
then consider K being (Linear_Combination of { v }) such that A7: v = ( Sum K ) by CKB2:1;
A8: (( Carrier L ) c= B & ( Carrier K ) c= { v }) by RLVECT_2:def 6;
then ( ( Carrier L ) \/ ( Carrier K ) ) c= ( B \/ { v } ) by XBOOLE_1:13;
then (( Carrier ( L - K ) ) c= ( ( Carrier L ) \/ ( Carrier K ) ) & ( ( Carrier L ) \/ ( Carrier K ) ) c= A) by A4,RLVECT_2:55,XBOOLE_1:1;
then ( Carrier ( L - K ) ) c= A by XBOOLE_1:1;
then A9: ( L - K ) is (Linear_Combination of A) by RLVECT_2:def 6;
A10: (for x being (VECTOR of V) holds (x in ( Carrier L ) implies ( K . x ) = ( 0 )))
proof
let x being (VECTOR of V);
assume x in ( Carrier L );
then (not x in ( Carrier K )) by A3,A8,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence thesis;
end;
now
let x being set;
assume that
A11: x in ( Carrier L )
and
A12: (not x in ( Carrier ( L - K ) ));
reconsider x as (VECTOR of V) by A11;
A13: ( L . x ) <> ( 0 ) by A11,RLVECT_2:19;
( ( L - K ) . x ) = ( ( L . x ) - ( K . x ) ) by RLVECT_2:54
.= ( ( L . x ) - ( 0 ) ) by A10,A11
.= ( L . x );
hence contradiction by A12,A13;
end;
then A14: ( Carrier L ) c= ( Carrier ( L - K ) ) by TARSKI:def 3;
( 0. V ) = ( ( Sum L ) + ( - ( Sum K ) ) ) by A5,A7,RLVECT_1:5
.= ( ( Sum L ) + ( Sum ( - K ) ) ) by RLVECT_3:3
.= ( Sum ( L - K ) ) by RLVECT_3:1;
hence contradiction by A1,A6,A9,A14,RLVECT_3:def 1;
end;
