let V being RealUnitarySpace;
let A being (Subset of V);
func Lin A ->  strict (Subspace of V) means 
:Def1: (the carrier of it) = { ( Sum l ) where l is (Linear_Combination of A): (not contradiction) };
existence
proof
set A1 = { ( Sum l ) where l is (Linear_Combination of A): (not contradiction) };
A1 c= (the carrier of V)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in A1;
then (ex l being (Linear_Combination of A) st x = ( Sum l ));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider A1 as (Subset of V);
reconsider l = ( ZeroLC V ) as (Linear_Combination of A) by RLVECT_2:22;
A1: A1 is  linearly-closed
proof
thus (for v,u being (VECTOR of V) holds ((v in A1 & u in A1) implies ( v + u ) in A1))
proof
let v being (VECTOR of V);
let u being (VECTOR of V);
assume that
A2: v in A1
and
A3: u in A1;
consider l1 being (Linear_Combination of A) such that A4: v = ( Sum l1 ) by A2;
consider l2 being (Linear_Combination of A) such that A5: u = ( Sum l2 ) by A3;
reconsider f = ( l1 + l2 ) as (Linear_Combination of A) by RLVECT_2:38;
( v + u ) = ( Sum f ) by A4,A5,RLVECT_3:1;
hence thesis;
end;

let a being Real;
let v being (VECTOR of V);
assume v in A1;
then consider l being (Linear_Combination of A) such that A6: v = ( Sum l );
reconsider f = ( a * l ) as (Linear_Combination of A) by RLVECT_2:44;
( a * v ) = ( Sum f ) by A6,RLVECT_3:2;
hence thesis;
end;
( Sum l ) = ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_2:30;
then ( 0. V ) in A1;
hence thesis by A1,RUSUB_1:29;
