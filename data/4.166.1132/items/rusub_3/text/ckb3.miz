theorem
Th2: (for V being RealUnitarySpace holds (for A being (Subset of V) holds (for x being set holds (x in A implies x in ( Lin A )))))
proof
deffunc F(set) = ( 0 );
let V being RealUnitarySpace;
let A being (Subset of V);
let x being set;
assume A1: x in A;
then reconsider v = x as (VECTOR of V);
consider f being (Function of (the carrier of V),( REAL )) such that A2: ( f . v ) = 1 and A3: (for u being (VECTOR of V) holds (u <> v implies ( f . u ) = F(u))) from FUNCT_2:sch 6;
reconsider f as (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of V),( REAL )) )) by FUNCT_2:8;
(ex T being  finite (Subset of V) st (for u being (VECTOR of V) holds ((not u in T) implies ( f . u ) = ( 0 ))))
proof
take T = { v };
let u being (VECTOR of V);
assume (not u in T);
then u <> v by TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
then reconsider f as (Linear_Combination of V) by RLVECT_2:def 3;
A4: ( Carrier f ) c= { v }
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( Carrier f );
then consider u being (VECTOR of V) such that A5: x = u and A6: ( f . u ) <> ( 0 );
u = v by A3,A6;
hence thesis by A5,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
then reconsider f as (Linear_Combination of { v }) by RLVECT_2:def 6;
A7: ( Sum f ) = ( 1 * v ) by A2,RLVECT_2:32
.= v by RLVECT_1:def 8;
{ v } c= A by A1,ZFMISC_1:31;
then ( Carrier f ) c= A by A4,XBOOLE_1:1;
then reconsider f as (Linear_Combination of A) by RLVECT_2:def 6;
( Sum f ) = v by A7;
hence thesis by CKB2:1;
