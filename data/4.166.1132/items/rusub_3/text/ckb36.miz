theorem
(for V being RealUnitarySpace holds (for W being (Subspace of V) holds (for A being (Subset of V) holds (for B being (Subset of W) holds (A = B implies ( Lin A ) = ( Lin B ))))))
proof
let V being RealUnitarySpace;
let W being (Subspace of V);
let A being (Subset of V);
let B being (Subset of W);
reconsider B9 = ( Lin B ),V9 = V as RealUnitarySpace;
A1: B9 is (Subspace of V9) by RUSUB_1:21;
assume A2: A = B;
now
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of ( Lin A ));
then x in ( Lin A ) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
then consider L being (Linear_Combination of A) such that A3: x = ( Sum L ) by CKB2:1;
( Carrier L ) c= A by RLVECT_2:def 6;
then consider K being (Linear_Combination of W) such that A4: ( Carrier K ) = ( Carrier L ) and A5: ( Sum K ) = ( Sum L ) by A2,CKB27:1,XBOOLE_1:1;
reconsider K as (Linear_Combination of B) by A2,A4,RLVECT_2:def 6;
x = ( Sum K ) by A3,A5;
then x in ( Lin B ) by CKB2:1;
hence x in (the carrier of ( Lin B )) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
end;
then A6: (the carrier of ( Lin A )) c= (the carrier of ( Lin B )) by TARSKI:def 3;
now
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of ( Lin B ));
then x in ( Lin B ) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
then consider K being (Linear_Combination of B) such that A7: x = ( Sum K ) by CKB2:1;
consider L being (Linear_Combination of V) such that A8: ( Carrier L ) = ( Carrier K ) and A9: ( Sum L ) = ( Sum K ) by CKB26:1;
reconsider L as (Linear_Combination of A) by A2,A8,RLVECT_2:def 6;
x = ( Sum L ) by A7,A9;
then x in ( Lin A ) by CKB2:1;
hence x in (the carrier of ( Lin A )) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
end;
then (the carrier of ( Lin B )) c= (the carrier of ( Lin A )) by TARSKI:def 3;
then (the carrier of ( Lin A )) = (the carrier of ( Lin B )) by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by A1,RUSUB_1:24;
