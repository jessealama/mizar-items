definition
let X;
let R being (Relation of [: X,X :]);
func lambda R -> (Relation of [: X,X :])
means
:Def1: (for a,b,c,d being (Element of X) holds ([ [ a,b ],[ c,d ] ] in it iff ([ [ a,b ],[ c,d ] ] in R or [ [ a,b ],[ d,c ] ] in R)));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(ex a,b,c,d being (Element of X) st (($1 = [ a,b ] & $2 = [ c,d ]) & ([ [ a,b ],[ c,d ] ] in R or [ [ a,b ],[ d,c ] ] in R)));
set XX = [: X,X :];
consider P being (Relation of XX,XX) such that A1: (for x holds (for y holds ([ x,y ] in P iff ((x in XX & y in XX) & P[ x,y ])))) from RELSET_1:sch 1;
take P;
let a being (Element of X),b being (Element of X),c being (Element of X),d being (Element of X);
([ [ a,b ],[ c,d ] ] in P implies ([ [ a,b ],[ c,d ] ] in R or [ [ a,b ],[ d,c ] ] in R))
proof
assume [ [ a,b ],[ c,d ] ] in P;
then consider a9 being (Element of X),b9 being (Element of X),c9 being (Element of X),d9 being (Element of X) such that A2: [ a,b ] = [ a9,b9 ] and A3: [ c,d ] = [ c9,d9 ] and A4: ([ [ a9,b9 ],[ c9,d9 ] ] in R or [ [ a9,b9 ],[ d9,c9 ] ] in R) by A1;
c = c9 by A3,ZFMISC_1:27;
hence thesis by A2,A3,A4,ZFMISC_1:27;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
set XX = [: X,X :];
let P being (Relation of [: X,X :]),Q being (Relation of [: X,X :]);
assume that
A5: (for a,b,c,d being (Element of X) holds ([ [ a,b ],[ c,d ] ] in P iff ([ [ a,b ],[ c,d ] ] in R or [ [ a,b ],[ d,c ] ] in R)))
and
A6: (for a,b,c,d being (Element of X) holds ([ [ a,b ],[ c,d ] ] in Q iff ([ [ a,b ],[ c,d ] ] in R or [ [ a,b ],[ d,c ] ] in R)));
(for x holds (for y holds ([ x,y ] in P iff [ x,y ] in Q)))
proof
let x;
let y;
A7:now
assume A8: [ x,y ] in Q;
then y in XX by ZFMISC_1:87;
then consider c,d such that A9: y = [ c,d ] by DOMAIN_1:1;
x in XX by A8,ZFMISC_1:87;
then A10: (ex a st (ex b st x = [ a,b ])) by DOMAIN_1:1;
then ([ x,y ] in Q iff ([ x,y ] in R or [ x,[ d,c ] ] in R)) by A6,A9;
hence [ x,y ] in P by A5,A8,A10,A9;
end;
now
assume A11: [ x,y ] in P;
then y in XX by ZFMISC_1:87;
then consider c,d such that A12: y = [ c,d ] by DOMAIN_1:1;
x in XX by A11,ZFMISC_1:87;
then A13: (ex a st (ex b st x = [ a,b ])) by DOMAIN_1:1;
then ([ x,y ] in P iff ([ x,y ] in R or [ x,[ d,c ] ] in R)) by A5,A12;
hence [ x,y ] in Q by A6,A11,A13,A12;
end;
hence thesis by A7;

hence thesis by RELAT_1:def 2;
