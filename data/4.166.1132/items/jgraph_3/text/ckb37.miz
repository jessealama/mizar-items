proof
let x being set;
assume A64: x in ( dom h );
then reconsider p = x as (Point of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) by A13,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
(not x in { ( 0. ( TOP-REAL 2 ) ) }) by A13,A64,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then A65: x <> ( 0. ( TOP-REAL 2 ) ) by TARSKI:def 1;
x in ( (the carrier of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) \ ( D ` ) ) by A3,A13,A64;
then A66: x in ( ( D ` ) ` ) by SUBSET_1:def 4;
per cases ;
suppose A67: x in K0;

A68: ( ( ( Sq_Circ ) | D ) . p ) = ( ( Sq_Circ ) . p ) by A66,FUNCT_1:49

( h . p ) = ( ( g +* f ) . p ) by A61,A62,FUNCT_4:34
.= ( f . p ) by A58,A67,FUNCT_4:13;
hence thesis by A68;

suppose (not x in K0);
