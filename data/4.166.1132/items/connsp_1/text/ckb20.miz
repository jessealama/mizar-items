theorem
Th18: (((A is  connected & B is  connected) & (not A,B are_separated )) implies ( A \/ B ) is  connected)
proof
assume that
A1: A is  connected
and
A2: B is  connected
and
A3: (not A,B are_separated );
assume (not ( A \/ B ) is  connected);
then consider P being (Subset of GX),Q being (Subset of GX) such that A4: ( A \/ B ) = ( P \/ Q ) and A5: P,Q are_separated  and A6: P <> ( {} GX ) and A7: Q <> ( {} GX ) by CKB18:1;
A8: (not (A c= Q & B c= P)) by A3,A5,CKB8:1;
P misses Q by A5,CKB2:1;
then A9: ( P /\ Q ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
A10:now
A11: P c= ( P \/ Q ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
assume that
A12: A c= P
and
A13: B c= P;
( A \/ B ) c= P by A12,A13,XBOOLE_1:8;
then ( P \/ Q ) = P by A4,A11,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence contradiction by A7,A9,XBOOLE_1:7,XBOOLE_1:28;
end;
A14:now
A15: Q c= ( Q \/ P ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
assume that
A16: A c= Q
and
A17: B c= Q;
( A \/ B ) c= Q by A16,A17,XBOOLE_1:8;
then ( Q \/ P ) = Q by A4,A15,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence contradiction by A6,A9,XBOOLE_1:7,XBOOLE_1:28;
end;
(not (A c= P & B c= Q)) by A3,A5,CKB8:1;
hence contradiction by A1,A2,A4,A5,A10,A8,A14,CKB19:1,XBOOLE_1:7;
