theorem
Th31: ((ex x being (Point of GX) st (for y being (Point of GX) holds x,y are_joined )) iff (for x,y being (Point of GX) holds x,y are_joined ))
proof
A1:now
given a being (Point of GX) such that
A2: (for x being (Point of GX) holds a,x are_joined );

let x being (Point of GX),y being (Point of GX);
a,x are_joined  by A2;
then consider C1 being (Subset of GX) such that A3: C1 is  connected and A4: a in C1 and A5: x in C1 by CKB32:def 1;
a,y are_joined  by A2;
then consider C2 being (Subset of GX) such that A6: C2 is  connected and A7: a in C2 and A8: y in C2 by CKB32:def 1;
( C1 /\ C2 ) <> ( {} GX ) by A4,A7,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then C1 meets C2 by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A9: ( C1 \/ C2 ) is  connected by A3,A6,CKB2:1,CKB20:1;
A10: y in ( C1 \/ C2 ) by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
x in ( C1 \/ C2 ) by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence x,y are_joined  by A9,A10,CKB32:def 1;
end;
now
set a = the (Point of GX);
assume (for x,y being (Point of GX) holds x,y are_joined );
then (for y being (Point of GX) holds a,y are_joined );
hence (ex x being (Point of GX) st (for y being (Point of GX) holds x,y are_joined ));
end;
hence thesis by A1;
