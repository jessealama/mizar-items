reserve GX for TopSpace;
reserve A for (Subset of GX);
reserve B for (Subset of GX);
theorem
(GX is  connected iff (for A,B being (Subset of GX) holds (((((( [#] GX ) = ( A \/ B ) & A <> ( {} GX )) & B <> ( {} GX )) & A is  open) & B is  open) implies A meets B)))
proof
A1:now
assume (not GX is  connected);
then consider P being (Subset of GX),Q being (Subset of GX) such that A2: ( [#] GX ) = ( P \/ Q ) and A3: P,Q are_separated  and A4: P <> ( {} GX ) and A5: Q <> ( {} GX ) by CKB11:def 1;
reconsider P,Q as (Subset of GX);
A6: Q is  open by A2,A3,CKB5:1;
P is  open by A2,A3,CKB5:1;
hence (ex A,B being (Subset of GX) st (((((( [#] GX ) = ( A \/ B ) & A <> ( {} GX )) & B <> ( {} GX )) & A is  open) & B is  open) & A misses B)) by A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,CKB2:1;
end;
now
given A being (Subset of GX),B being (Subset of GX) such that
A7: ( [#] GX ) = ( A \/ B )
and
A8: A <> ( {} GX )
and
A9: B <> ( {} GX )
and
A10: A is  open
and
A11: B is  open
and
A12: A misses B;

A,B are_separated  by A7,A10,A11,A12,CKB4:1;
hence (not GX is  connected) by A7,A8,A9,CKB11:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
