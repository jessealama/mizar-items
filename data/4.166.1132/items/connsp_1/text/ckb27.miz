theorem
((((A is  closed & B is  closed) & ( A \/ B ) is  connected) & ( A /\ B ) is  connected) implies (A is  connected & B is  connected))
proof
assume that
A1: A is  closed
and
A2: B is  closed;
set AB = ( A \/ B );
A3: ( A \/ B ) = ( [#] ( GX | ( A \/ B ) ) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
then reconsider B1 = B as (Subset of ( GX | AB )) by XBOOLE_1:7;
reconsider A1 = A as (Subset of ( GX | AB )) by A3,XBOOLE_1:7;
A4: ( ( [#] ( GX | ( A \/ B ) ) ) \ ( A1 /\ B1 ) ) = ( ( A1 \ B1 ) \/ ( B1 \ A1 ) ) by A3,XBOOLE_1:55;
( B /\ ( [#] ( GX | ( A \/ B ) ) ) ) = B by A3,XBOOLE_1:7,XBOOLE_1:28;
then A5: B1 is  closed by A2,PRE_TOPC:13;
( A /\ ( [#] ( GX | ( A \/ B ) ) ) ) = A by A3,XBOOLE_1:7,XBOOLE_1:28;
then A1 is  closed by A1,PRE_TOPC:13;
then A6: ( A1 \ B1 ),( B1 \ A1 ) are_separated  by A5,CKB10:1;
assume that
A7: ( A \/ B ) is  connected
and
A8: ( A /\ B ) is  connected;
A9: ( GX | ( A \/ B ) ) is  connected by A7,CKB17:def 1;
A10: ( A1 /\ B1 ) is  connected by A8,CKB26:1;
( ( A1 /\ B1 ) \/ ( B1 \ A1 ) ) = B1 by XBOOLE_1:51;
then A11: B1 is  connected by A9,A4,A6,A10,CKB23:1;
( ( A1 /\ B1 ) \/ ( A1 \ B1 ) ) = A1 by XBOOLE_1:51;
then A1 is  connected by A9,A4,A6,A10,CKB23:1;
hence thesis by A11,CKB26:1;
