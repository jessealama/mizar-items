reserve GX for TopSpace;
theorem
(for GY being TopSpace holds (for F being (Function of GX,GY) holds (((F is  continuous & ( F .: ( [#] GX ) ) = ( [#] GY )) & GX is  connected) implies GY is  connected)))
proof
let GY being TopSpace;
let F being (Function of GX,GY);
assume that
A1: F is  continuous
and
A2: ( F .: ( [#] GX ) ) = ( [#] GY )
and
A3: GX is  connected;
assume (not GY is  connected);
then consider A being (Subset of GY),B being (Subset of GY) such that A4: ( [#] GY ) = ( A \/ B ) and A5: A <> ( {} GY ) and A6: B <> ( {} GY ) and A7: A is  closed and A8: B is  closed and A9: A misses B by CKB12:1;
A10: ( F " A ) is  closed by A1,A7,PRE_TOPC:def 6;
A11: ( F " B ) is  closed by A1,A8,PRE_TOPC:def 6;
A12: ( A /\ B ) = ( {} ) by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
( ( F " A ) /\ ( F " B ) ) = ( F " ( A /\ B ) ) by FUNCT_1:68
.= ( {} ) by A12,RELAT_1:136;
then A13: ( F " A ) misses ( F " B ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
A14: (the carrier of GY) is non empty by A5;
then A15: ( [#] GX ) = ( F " (the carrier of GY) ) by FUNCT_2:40
.= ( ( F " A ) \/ ( F " B ) ) by A4,RELAT_1:140;
A16: ( rng F ) = ( F .: (the carrier of GX) ) by A14,FUNCT_2:37;
then A17: ( F " B ) <> ( {} GX ) by A2,A6,RELAT_1:139;
( F " A ) <> ( {} GX ) by A2,A5,A16,RELAT_1:139;
hence contradiction by A3,A15,A13,A10,A11,A17,CKB12:1;
