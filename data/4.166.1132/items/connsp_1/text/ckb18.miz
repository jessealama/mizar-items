theorem
Th16: (A is  connected iff (for P,Q being (Subset of GX) holds ((A = ( P \/ Q ) & P,Q are_separated ) implies (P = ( {} GX ) or Q = ( {} GX )))))
proof
A1: ( [#] ( GX | A ) ) = A by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
A2:now
assume (not A is  connected);
then (not ( GX | A ) is  connected) by CKB17:def 1;
then consider P being (Subset of ( GX | A )),Q being (Subset of ( GX | A )) such that A3: ( [#] ( GX | A ) ) = ( P \/ Q ) and A4: P,Q are_separated  and A5: P <> ( {} ( GX | A ) ) and A6: Q <> ( {} ( GX | A ) ) by CKB11:def 1;
reconsider Q1 = Q as (Subset of GX) by PRE_TOPC:11;
reconsider P1 = P as (Subset of GX) by PRE_TOPC:11;
P1,Q1 are_separated  by A4,CKB6:1;
hence (ex P1,Q1 being (Subset of GX) st (((A = ( P1 \/ Q1 ) & P1,Q1 are_separated ) & P1 <> ( {} GX )) & Q1 <> ( {} GX ))) by A1,A3,A5,A6;
end;
A7: ( {} ( GX | A ) ) = ( {} );
now
given P being (Subset of GX),Q being (Subset of GX) such that
A8: A = ( P \/ Q )
and
A9: P,Q are_separated 
and
A10: P <> ( {} GX )
and
A11: Q <> ( {} GX );

reconsider Q1 = Q as (Subset of ( GX | A )) by A1,A8,XBOOLE_1:7;
reconsider P1 = P as (Subset of ( GX | A )) by A1,A8,XBOOLE_1:7;
P1,Q1 are_separated  by A1,A8,A9,CKB7:1;
then (not ( GX | A ) is  connected) by A1,A7,A8,A10,A11,CKB11:def 1;
hence (not A is  connected) by CKB17:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by A2;
