theorem
Th28: (( [#] GX ) is  connected iff GX is  connected)
proof
A1: ( [#] GX ) = ( [#] ( GX | ( [#] GX ) ) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
A2: ( {} ( GX | ( [#] GX ) ) ) = ( {} GX );
A3:now
assume A4: GX is  connected;
now
let P1 being (Subset of ( GX | ( [#] GX ) )),Q1 being (Subset of ( GX | ( [#] GX ) ));
assume that
A5: ( [#] ( GX | ( [#] GX ) ) ) = ( P1 \/ Q1 )
and
A6: P1,Q1 are_separated ;
reconsider Q = Q1 as (Subset of GX) by PRE_TOPC:11;
reconsider P = P1 as (Subset of GX) by PRE_TOPC:11;
P,Q are_separated  by A6,CKB6:1;
hence (P1 = ( {} ( GX | ( [#] GX ) ) ) or Q1 = ( {} ( GX | ( [#] GX ) ) )) by A2,A1,A4,A5,CKB11:def 1;
end;
then ( GX | ( [#] GX ) ) is  connected by CKB11:def 1;
hence ( [#] GX ) is  connected by CKB17:def 1;
end;
now
assume ( [#] GX ) is  connected;
then A7: ( GX | ( [#] GX ) ) is  connected by CKB17:def 1;
now
let P1 being (Subset of GX),Q1 being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A8: ( [#] GX ) = ( P1 \/ Q1 )
and
A9: P1,Q1 are_separated ;
reconsider Q = Q1 as (Subset of ( GX | ( [#] GX ) )) by A1;
reconsider P = P1 as (Subset of ( GX | ( [#] GX ) )) by A1;
P,Q are_separated  by A1,A8,A9,CKB7:1;
hence (P1 = ( {} GX ) or Q1 = ( {} GX )) by A2,A1,A7,A8,CKB11:def 1;
end;
hence GX is  connected by CKB11:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by A3;
