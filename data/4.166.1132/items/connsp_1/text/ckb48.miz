defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex A1 being (Subset of GX) st ((A1 = $1 & A1 is  connected) & x in $1));
consider F being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A1: (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F iff P[ A ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;

thus (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F iff (A is  connected & x in A)))
proof
let A being (Subset of GX);
thus (A in F implies (A is  connected & x in A))
proof
assume A in F;
