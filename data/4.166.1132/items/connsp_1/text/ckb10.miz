theorem
Th10: (((K is  closed & L is  closed) or (K is  open & L is  open)) implies ( K \ L ),( L \ K ) are_separated )
proof
A1:now
let K being (Subset of TS),L being (Subset of TS);
assume that
A2: K is  open
and
A3: L is  open;
A4: ( K /\ ( L ` ) ) c= K by XBOOLE_1:17;
A5: ( ( Cl L ) /\ ( K ` ) ) c= ( K ` ) by XBOOLE_1:17;
( Cl ( ( [#] TS ) \ K ) ) = ( ( [#] TS ) \ K ) by A2,PRE_TOPC:23;
then A6: ( ( K /\ ( L ` ) ) /\ ( ( Cl L ) /\ ( Cl ( K ` ) ) ) ) c= ( K /\ ( K ` ) ) by A4,A5,XBOOLE_1:27;
A7: ( K \ L ) = ( K /\ ( L ` ) ) by SUBSET_1:13;
A8: ( L /\ ( K ` ) ) c= L by XBOOLE_1:17;
( ( Cl K ) /\ ( L ` ) ) c= ( L ` ) by XBOOLE_1:17;
then A9: ( ( ( Cl K ) /\ ( L ` ) ) /\ ( L /\ ( K ` ) ) ) c= ( L /\ ( L ` ) ) by A8,XBOOLE_1:27;
L misses ( L ` ) by XBOOLE_1:79;
then A10: ( L /\ ( L ` ) ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
K misses ( K ` ) by XBOOLE_1:79;
then A11: ( K /\ ( K ` ) ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
( ( [#] TS ) \ K ) = ( K ` );
then A12: ( ( ( Cl K ) /\ ( Cl ( L ` ) ) ) /\ ( L /\ ( K ` ) ) ) = ( ( ( Cl K ) /\ ( L ` ) ) /\ ( L /\ ( K ` ) ) ) by A3,PRE_TOPC:23;
A13: ( L \ K ) = ( L /\ ( K ` ) ) by SUBSET_1:13;
( Cl ( L /\ ( K ` ) ) ) c= ( ( Cl L ) /\ ( Cl ( K ` ) ) ) by PRE_TOPC:21;
then ( ( K \ L ) /\ ( Cl ( L \ K ) ) ) c= ( ( K /\ ( L ` ) ) /\ ( ( Cl L ) /\ ( Cl ( K ` ) ) ) ) by A7,A13,XBOOLE_1:27;
then ( ( K \ L ) /\ ( Cl ( L \ K ) ) ) = ( {} TS ) by A11,A6;
then A14: ( K \ L ) misses ( Cl ( L \ K ) ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
( Cl ( K /\ ( L ` ) ) ) c= ( ( Cl K ) /\ ( Cl ( L ` ) ) ) by PRE_TOPC:21;
then ( ( Cl ( K \ L ) ) /\ ( L \ K ) ) c= ( ( ( Cl K ) /\ ( Cl ( L ` ) ) ) /\ ( L /\ ( K ` ) ) ) by A7,A13,XBOOLE_1:27;
then ( ( Cl ( K \ L ) ) /\ ( L \ K ) ) = ( {} TS ) by A12,A10,A9;
then ( Cl ( K \ L ) ) misses ( L \ K ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
hence ( K \ L ),( L \ K ) are_separated  by A14,CKB1:def 1;
end;
A15:now
let K being (Subset of TS),L being (Subset of TS);
assume that
A16: K is  closed
and
A17: L is  closed;
A18: ( ( [#] TS ) \ L ) is  open by A17,PRE_TOPC:def 3;
A19: ( ( ( [#] TS ) \ K ) \ ( ( [#] TS ) \ L ) ) = ( ( K ` ) /\ ( ( ( [#] TS ) \ L ) ` ) ) by SUBSET_1:13
.= ( ( K ` ) /\ L ) by PRE_TOPC:3
.= ( L \ K ) by SUBSET_1:13;
A20: ( ( ( [#] TS ) \ L ) \ ( ( [#] TS ) \ K ) ) = ( ( L ` ) /\ ( ( ( [#] TS ) \ K ) ` ) ) by SUBSET_1:13
.= ( ( L ` ) /\ K ) by PRE_TOPC:3
.= ( K \ L ) by SUBSET_1:13;
( ( [#] TS ) \ K ) is  open by A16,PRE_TOPC:def 3;
hence ( K \ L ),( L \ K ) are_separated  by A1,A18,A20,A19;
end;
assume ((K is  closed & L is  closed) or (K is  open & L is  open));
hence thesis by A1,A15;
end;
