theorem
Th21: ((((GX is  connected & A is  connected) & ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) = ( B \/ C )) & B,C are_separated ) implies (( A \/ B ) is  connected & ( A \/ C ) is  connected))
proof
assume that
A1: GX is  connected
and
A2: A is  connected
and
A3: ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) = ( B \/ C )
and
A4: B,C are_separated ;
now
let A being (Subset of GX),B being (Subset of GX),C being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A5: GX is  connected
and
A6: A is  connected
and
A7: ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) = ( B \/ C )
and
A8: B,C are_separated ;
now
let P being (Subset of GX),Q being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A9: ( A \/ B ) = ( P \/ Q )
and
A10: P,Q are_separated ;
A11: ( [#] GX ) = ( A \/ ( B \/ C ) ) by A7,XBOOLE_1:45
.= ( ( P \/ Q ) \/ C ) by A9,XBOOLE_1:4;
A12:now
assume A c= Q;
then P misses A by A10,CKB2:1,CKB8:1;
then P c= B by A9,XBOOLE_1:7,XBOOLE_1:73;
then P,C are_separated  by A8,CKB8:1;
then A13: P,( Q \/ C ) are_separated  by A10,CKB9:1;
( [#] GX ) = ( P \/ ( Q \/ C ) ) by A11,XBOOLE_1:4;
hence (P = ( {} GX ) or Q = ( {} GX )) by A5,A13,CKB11:def 1;
end;
now
assume A c= P;
then Q misses A by A10,CKB2:1,CKB8:1;
then Q c= B by A9,XBOOLE_1:7,XBOOLE_1:73;
then Q,C are_separated  by A8,CKB8:1;
then A14: Q,( P \/ C ) are_separated  by A10,CKB9:1;
( [#] GX ) = ( Q \/ ( P \/ C ) ) by A11,XBOOLE_1:4;
hence (P = ( {} GX ) or Q = ( {} GX )) by A5,A14,CKB11:def 1;
end;
hence (P = ( {} GX ) or Q = ( {} GX )) by A6,A9,A10,A12,CKB19:1,XBOOLE_1:7;
end;
hence ( A \/ B ) is  connected by CKB18:1;
end;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A3,A4;
end;
