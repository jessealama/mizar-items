theorem
(((GX is  connected & A is  connected) & C is_a_component_of ( ( [#] GX ) \ A )) implies ( ( [#] GX ) \ C ) is  connected)
proof
assume that
A1: GX is  connected
and
A2: A is  connected
and
A3: C is_a_component_of ( ( [#] GX ) \ A );
consider C1 being (Subset of ( GX | ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) )) such that A4: C1 = C and A5: C1 is  a_component by A3,CKB46:def 1;
reconsider C2 = C1 as (Subset of GX) by A4;
C1 c= ( [#] ( GX | ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) ) );
then C1 c= ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
then ( ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) ` ) c= ( C2 ` ) by SUBSET_1:12;
then A6: A c= ( C2 ` ) by PRE_TOPC:3;
now
A misses C1 by A6,SUBSET_1:23;
then A7: ( A /\ C1 ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
A8: C is  connected by A4,A5,CKB26:1;
let P being (Subset of GX),Q being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A9: ( ( [#] GX ) \ C ) = ( P \/ Q )
and
A10: P,Q are_separated ;
A11: P misses ( P ` ) by XBOOLE_1:79;
A12: P misses Q by A10,CKB2:1;
A13:now
A14: Q misses ( Q ` ) by XBOOLE_1:79;
assume A15: A c= Q;
P c= ( Q ` ) by A12,SUBSET_1:23;
then ( A /\ P ) c= ( Q /\ ( Q ` ) ) by A15,XBOOLE_1:27;
then A16: ( A /\ P ) c= ( {} ) by A14,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
( ( C \/ P ) /\ A ) = ( ( A /\ C ) \/ ( A /\ P ) ) by XBOOLE_1:23
.= ( {} ) by A4,A7,A16;
then ( C \/ P ) misses A by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then ( C \/ P ) c= ( A ` ) by SUBSET_1:23;
then ( C \/ P ) c= ( [#] ( GX | ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) ) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
then reconsider C1P1 = ( C \/ P ) as (Subset of ( GX | ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) ));
A17: C misses ( C ` ) by XBOOLE_1:79;
( C \/ P ) is  connected by A1,A9,A10,A8,CKB23:1;
then A18: C1P1 is  connected by CKB26:1;
C c= ( C1 \/ P ) by A4,XBOOLE_1:7;
then C1P1 = C1 by A4,A5,A18,CKB37:def 1;
then A19: P c= C by A4,XBOOLE_1:7;
P c= ( ( [#] GX ) \ C ) by A9,XBOOLE_1:7;
then P c= ( C /\ ( ( [#] GX ) \ C ) ) by A19,XBOOLE_1:19;
then P c= ( {} ) by A17,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
hence P = ( {} GX );
end;
A20: Q c= ( ( [#] GX ) \ C ) by A9,XBOOLE_1:7;
now
assume A21: A c= P;
Q c= ( P ` ) by A12,SUBSET_1:23;
then ( A /\ Q ) c= ( P /\ ( P ` ) ) by A21,XBOOLE_1:27;
then A22: ( A /\ Q ) c= ( {} ) by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
( ( C \/ Q ) /\ A ) = ( ( A /\ C ) \/ ( A /\ Q ) ) by XBOOLE_1:23
.= ( {} ) by A4,A7,A22;
then ( C \/ Q ) misses A by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then ( C \/ Q ) c= ( A ` ) by SUBSET_1:23;
then ( C \/ Q ) c= ( [#] ( GX | ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) ) ) by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
then reconsider C1Q1 = ( C \/ Q ) as (Subset of ( GX | ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) ));
( C \/ Q ) is  connected by A1,A9,A10,A8,CKB23:1;
then A23: C1Q1 is  connected by CKB26:1;
C1 c= ( C1 \/ Q ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
then C1Q1 = C1 by A4,A5,A23,CKB37:def 1;
then Q c= C by A4,XBOOLE_1:7;
then A24: Q c= ( C /\ ( ( [#] GX ) \ C ) ) by A20,XBOOLE_1:19;
C misses ( C ` ) by XBOOLE_1:79;
then Q c= ( {} ) by A24,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
hence Q = ( {} GX );
end;
hence (P = ( {} GX ) or Q = ( {} GX )) by A2,A4,A6,A9,A10,A13,CKB19:1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB18:1;
