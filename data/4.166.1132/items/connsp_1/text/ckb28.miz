theorem
Th26: (for F being (Subset-Family of GX) holds (((for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F implies A is  connected)) & (ex A being (Subset of GX) st ((A <> ( {} GX ) & A in F) & (for B being (Subset of GX) holds ((B in F & B <> A) implies (not A,B are_separated )))))) implies ( union F ) is  connected))
proof
let F being (Subset-Family of GX);
assume that
A1: (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F implies A is  connected))
and
A2: (ex A being (Subset of GX) st ((A <> ( {} GX ) & A in F) & (for B being (Subset of GX) holds ((B in F & B <> A) implies (not A,B are_separated )))));
consider A1 being (Subset of GX) such that A1 <> ( {} GX ) and A3: A1 in F and A4: (for B being (Subset of GX) holds ((B in F & B <> A1) implies (not A1,B are_separated ))) by A2;
reconsider A1 as (Subset of GX);
now
let P being (Subset of GX),Q being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A5: ( union F ) = ( P \/ Q )
and
A6: P,Q are_separated ;
P misses Q by A6,CKB2:1;
then A7: ( P /\ Q ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
A8:now
assume A9: A1 c= Q;
now
let B being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A10: B in F
and
B <> A1
and
A11: (not B c= Q);
B is  connected by A1,A10;
then (B c= P or B c= Q) by A5,A6,A10,CKB19:1,ZFMISC_1:74;
hence contradiction by A4,A6,A9,A10,A11,CKB8:1;
end;
then (for A being set holds (A in F implies A c= Q)) by A9;
then A12: ( union F ) c= Q by ZFMISC_1:76;
Q c= ( P \/ Q ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
then Q = ( P \/ Q ) by A5,A12,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence P = ( {} GX ) by A7,XBOOLE_1:7,XBOOLE_1:28;
end;
A13:now
assume A14: A1 c= P;
now
let B being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A15: B in F
and
B <> A1;
B is  connected by A1,A15;
then A16: (B c= P or B c= Q) by A5,A6,A15,CKB19:1,ZFMISC_1:74;
assume (not B c= P);
hence contradiction by A4,A6,A14,A15,A16,CKB8:1;
end;
then (for A being set holds (A in F implies A c= P)) by A14;
then A17: ( union F ) c= P by ZFMISC_1:76;
P c= ( P \/ Q ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
then P = ( P \/ Q ) by A5,A17,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence Q = ( {} GX ) by A7,XBOOLE_1:7,XBOOLE_1:28;
end;
A1 c= ( P \/ Q ) by A3,A5,ZFMISC_1:74;
hence (P = ( {} GX ) or Q = ( {} GX )) by A1,A3,A6,A13,A8,CKB19:1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB18:1;
