theorem
Th30: (for GX being non empty TopSpace holds ((ex x being (Point of GX) st (for y being (Point of GX) holds x,y are_joined )) implies GX is  connected))
proof
let GX being non empty TopSpace;
given a being (Point of GX) such that
A1: (for x being (Point of GX) holds a,x are_joined );

now
let x being (Point of GX);
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex C1 being (Subset of GX) st ((C1 = $1 & C1 is  connected) & x in $1));
consider F being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A2: (for C being (Subset of GX) holds (C in F iff P[ C ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
take F;
let C being (Subset of GX);
thus (C in F implies (C is  connected & x in C))
proof
assume C in F;
then (ex C1 being (Subset of GX) st ((C1 = C & C1 is  connected) & x in C)) by A2;
hence thesis;
end;

thus ((C is  connected & x in C) implies C in F) by A2;
end;
then consider F being (Subset-Family of GX) such that A3: (for C being (Subset of GX) holds (C in F iff (C is  connected & a in C)));
A4:now
let x being (Point of GX);
a,x are_joined  by A1;
hence (ex C being (Subset of GX) st ((C is  connected & a in C) & x in C)) by CKB32:def 1;
end;
now
let x being set;
assume x in ( [#] GX );
then consider C being (Subset of GX) such that A5: C is  connected and A6: a in C and A7: x in C by A4;
C in F by A3,A5,A6;
hence x in ( union F ) by A7,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
then ( [#] GX ) c= ( union F ) by TARSKI:def 3;
then A8: ( union F ) = ( [#] GX ) by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
A9: (for A being set holds (A in F implies a in A)) by A3;
a in { a } by TARSKI:def 1;
then F <> ( {} ) by A3;
then A10: ( meet F ) <> ( {} GX ) by A9,SETFAM_1:def 1;
(for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F implies A is  connected)) by A3;
then ( [#] GX ) is  connected by A8,A10,CKB29:1;
hence thesis by CKB30:1;
end;
