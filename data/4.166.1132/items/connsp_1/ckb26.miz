theorem
Th24: (for X9 being (SubSpace of GX) holds (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (for B being (Subset of X9) holds (A = B implies (A is  connected iff B is  connected)))))
proof
let X9 being (SubSpace of GX);
let A being (Subset of GX);
let B being (Subset of X9);
assume A1: A = B;
reconsider GX9 = GX,X = X9 as TopSpace;
A2: ( [#] ( GX | A ) ) = A by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
reconsider B9 = B as (Subset of X);
reconsider A9 = A as (Subset of GX9);
A3: ( [#] ( X9 | B ) ) = B by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
A4: ( {} ( GX | A ) ) = ( {} ( X9 | B ) );
A5:now
assume (not A is  connected);
then (not ( GX9 | A9 ) is  connected) by CKB17:def 1;
then consider P being (Subset of ( GX | A )),Q being (Subset of ( GX | A )) such that A6: ( [#] ( GX | A ) ) = ( P \/ Q ) and A7: P <> ( {} ( GX | A ) ) and A8: Q <> ( {} ( GX | A ) ) and A9: P is  closed and A10: Q is  closed and A11: P misses Q by CKB12:1;

A15: P c= ( [#] X9 ) by A1,A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
( P1 /\ A ) c= P1 by XBOOLE_1:17;
then P c= ( P1 /\ ( [#] X9 ) ) by A2,A13,A15,XBOOLE_1:19;

then ( ( P1 /\ ( [#] X9 ) ) /\ A ) c= P by A2,A13,XBOOLE_1:27;
then ( P11 /\ ( [#] ( X9 | B ) ) ) = PP by A1,A3,A16,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then A17: PP is  closed by A14,PRE_TOPC:13;

then ( ( Q1 /\ ( [#] X9 ) ) /\ A ) c= Q by A2,A19,XBOOLE_1:27;
then A22: ( ( Q1 /\ ( [#] X9 ) ) /\ A ) = Q by A21,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
Q11 is  closed by A18,PRE_TOPC:13;
then QQ is  closed by A1,A3,A22,PRE_TOPC:13;
then (not ( X | B9 ) is  connected) by A1,A2,A3,A4,A6,A7,A8,A11,A17,CKB12:1;
hence (not B is  connected) by CKB17:def 1;
end;
now
assume (not B is  connected);
then (not ( X9 | B ) is  connected) by CKB17:def 1;
then consider P being (Subset of ( X9 | B )),Q being (Subset of ( X9 | B )) such that A23: ( [#] ( X9 | B ) ) = ( P \/ Q ) and A24: P <> ( {} ( X9 | B ) ) and A25: Q <> ( {} ( X9 | B ) ) and A26: P is  closed and A27: Q is  closed and A28: P misses Q by CKB12:1;

.= QQ by A3,A32,A34,XBOOLE_1:16;
then A35: QQ is  closed by A33,PRE_TOPC:13;
consider P2 being (Subset of GX) such that A36: P2 is  closed and A37: ( P2 /\ ( [#] X9 ) ) = P1 by A29,PRE_TOPC:13;

.= PP by A3,A30,A37,XBOOLE_1:16;
then PP is  closed by A36,PRE_TOPC:13;
then (not ( GX9 | A9 ) is  connected) by A1,A2,A3,A4,A23,A24,A25,A28,A35,CKB12:1;
hence (not A is  connected) by CKB17:def 1;
