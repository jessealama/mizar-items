theorem
Th13: (GX is  connected iff (for A being (Subset of GX) holds ((A <> ( {} GX ) & A <> ( [#] GX )) implies ( Cl A ) meets ( Cl ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) ))))
proof
A1:now
given A being (Subset of GX) such that
A2: A <> ( {} GX )
and
A3: A <> ( [#] GX )
and
A4: ( Cl A ) misses ( Cl ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) );

A5: ( ( Cl A ) /\ ( Cl ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) ) ) = ( {} ) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
A c= ( Cl A ) by PRE_TOPC:18;
then ( A /\ ( Cl ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) ) ) = ( {} GX ) by A5,XBOOLE_1:3,XBOOLE_1:27;
then A6: A misses ( Cl ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
A7: ( [#] GX ) = ( A \/ ( A ` ) ) by PRE_TOPC:2;
A8: ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) <> ( {} GX ) by A3,PRE_TOPC:4;
( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) c= ( Cl ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) ) by PRE_TOPC:18;
then ( ( Cl A ) /\ ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) ) = ( {} ) by A5,XBOOLE_1:3,XBOOLE_1:27;
then ( Cl A ) misses ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A,( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) are_separated  by A6,CKB1:def 1;
hence (not GX is  connected) by A2,A8,A7,CKB11:def 1;
end;
now
assume (not GX is  connected);
then consider A being (Subset of GX),B being (Subset of GX) such that A9: ( [#] GX ) = ( A \/ B ) and A10: A <> ( {} GX ) and A11: B <> ( {} GX ) and A12: A is  closed and A13: B is  closed and A14: A misses B by CKB12:1;
A15: ( Cl A ) = A by A12,PRE_TOPC:22;
A16: ( Cl B ) = B by A13,PRE_TOPC:22;
A17: B = ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) by A9,A14,PRE_TOPC:5;
then A <> ( [#] GX ) by A11,PRE_TOPC:4;
hence (ex A being (Subset of GX) st ((A <> ( {} GX ) & A <> ( [#] GX )) & ( Cl A ) misses ( Cl ( ( [#] GX ) \ A ) ))) by A10,A14,A17,A15,A16;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
