theorem
Th27: (for F being (Subset-Family of GX) holds (((for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F implies A is  connected)) & ( meet F ) <> ( {} GX )) implies ( union F ) is  connected))
proof
let F being (Subset-Family of GX);
assume that
A1: (for A being (Subset of GX) holds (A in F implies A is  connected))
and
A2: ( meet F ) <> ( {} GX );
consider x being (Point of GX) such that A3: x in ( meet F ) by A2,PRE_TOPC:12;
( meet F ) c= ( union F ) by SETFAM_1:2;
then consider A2 being set such that A4: x in A2 and A5: A2 in F by A3,TARSKI:def 4;
reconsider A2 as (Subset of GX) by A5;
A6:now
let B being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A7: B in F
and
B <> A2;
A2 c= ( Cl A2 ) by PRE_TOPC:18;
then ((x in ( Cl A2 ) & x in B) or (x in A2 & x in ( Cl B ))) by A3,A4,A7,SETFAM_1:def 1;
then (( ( Cl A2 ) /\ B ) <> ( {} ) or ( A2 /\ ( Cl B ) ) <> ( {} )) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then (( Cl A2 ) meets B or A2 meets ( Cl B )) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
hence (not A2,B are_separated ) by CKB1:def 1;
end;
A2 <> ( {} GX ) by A4;
hence thesis by A1,A5,A6,CKB28:1;
end;
