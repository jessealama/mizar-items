theorem
Th71: (for H being (Subgroup of G) holds (for N being  normal (Subgroup of G) holds (ex M being  strict (Subgroup of G) st (the carrier of M) = ( N ~ H ))))
proof
let H being (Subgroup of G);
let N being  normal (Subgroup of G);
A1: ( 1_ G ) in ( N ~ H )
proof
( 1_ G ) in H by GROUP_2:46;
then A2: ( 1_ G ) in ( carr H ) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
( 1_ G ) in ( ( 1_ G ) * N ) by GROUP_2:108;
then ( ( 1_ G ) * N ) meets ( carr H ) by A2,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis;
end;
A3: (for x,y being (Element of G) holds ((x in ( N ~ H ) & y in ( N ~ H )) implies ( x * y ) in ( N ~ H )))
proof
let x being (Element of G);
let y being (Element of G);
assume that
A4: x in ( N ~ H )
and
A5: y in ( N ~ H );
consider a being (Element of G) such that A6: (a in ( x * N ) & a in H) by A4,CKB55:1,CKB3:1;
consider b being (Element of G) such that A7: (b in ( y * N ) & b in H) by A5,CKB55:1,CKB3:1;
(( ( x * N ) * ( y * N ) ) = ( ( x * y ) * N ) & ( ( a * N ) * ( b * N ) ) = ( ( a * b ) * N )) by CKB1:1;
then A8: ( a * b ) in ( ( x * y ) * N ) by A6,A7;
( a * b ) in H by A6,A7,GROUP_2:50;
then ( a * b ) in ( carr H ) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
then ( ( x * y ) * N ) meets ( carr H ) by A8,XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis;

(for x being (Element of G) holds (x in ( N ~ H ) implies ( x " ) in ( N ~ H )))
proof
let x being (Element of G);
