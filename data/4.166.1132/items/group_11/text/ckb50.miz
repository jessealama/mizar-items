theorem
(for N1,N2 being  strict  normal (Subgroup of G) holds (ex N being  strict  normal (Subgroup of G) st ((the carrier of N) = ( N1 * N2 ) & ( N ~ A ) c= ( ( ( N1 ~ A ) * N2 ) /\ ( ( N2 ~ A ) * N1 ) ))))
proof
let N1 being  strict  normal (Subgroup of G);
let N2 being  strict  normal (Subgroup of G);
consider N being  strict  normal (Subgroup of G) such that A1: (the carrier of N) = ( N1 * N2 ) by CKB8:1;
( N ~ A ) c= ( ( ( N1 ~ A ) * N2 ) /\ ( ( N2 ~ A ) * N1 ) )
proof
let x being set;
assume A2: x in ( N ~ A );
then reconsider x as (Element of G);
( x * N ) meets A by A2,CKB16:1;
then consider x1 being set such that A3: (x1 in ( x * N ) & x1 in A) by XBOOLE_0:3;

.= ( x * ( b * N1 ) ) by GROUP_3:117
.= ( ( x * b ) * N1 ) by GROUP_2:105;
then ( ( x * b ) * N1 ) meets A by A3,A7,A8,XBOOLE_0:3;
