theorem
Th9: (for G being Group holds (for N,N1,N2 being (Subgroup of G) holds ((the carrier of N) = ( N1 * N2 ) implies (N1 is (Subgroup of N) & N2 is (Subgroup of N)))))
proof
let G being Group;
let N being (Subgroup of G);
let N1 being (Subgroup of G);
let N2 being (Subgroup of G);
assume A1: (the carrier of N) = ( N1 * N2 );
(for x being (Element of G) holds (x in N1 implies x in N))
proof
let x being (Element of G);
assume A2: x in N1;
A3: ( 1_ G ) in N2 by GROUP_2:46;
x = ( x * ( 1_ G ) ) by GROUP_1:def 4;
then x in ( N1 * N2 ) by A2,A3,CKB6:1;
hence thesis by A1,STRUCT_0:def 5;
end;
hence N1 is (Subgroup of N) by GROUP_2:58;
(for y being (Element of G) holds (y in N2 implies y in N))
proof
let y being (Element of G);
assume A4: y in N2;
A5: ( 1_ G ) in N1 by GROUP_2:46;
y = ( ( 1_ G ) * y ) by GROUP_1:def 4;
then y in ( N1 * N2 ) by A4,A5,CKB6:1;
hence thesis by A1,STRUCT_0:def 5;
end;
hence N2 is (Subgroup of N) by GROUP_2:58;
end;
