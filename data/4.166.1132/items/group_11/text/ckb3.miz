theorem
Th3: (for N being (Subgroup of G) holds (for H being (Subgroup of G) holds (for x being (Element of G) holds (( x * N ) meets ( carr H ) implies (ex y being (Element of G) st (y in ( x * N ) & y in H))))))
proof
let N being (Subgroup of G);
let H being (Subgroup of G);
let x being (Element of G);
assume ( x * N ) meets ( carr H );
then consider y being set such that A1: (y in ( x * N ) & y in ( carr H )) by XBOOLE_0:3;
reconsider y as (Element of G) by A1;
y in H by A1,STRUCT_0:def 5;
hence thesis by A1;
