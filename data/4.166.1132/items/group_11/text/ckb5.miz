theorem
Th5: (for N being (Subgroup of G) holds ((for x,y being (Element of G) holds (y in N implies ( ( x * y ) * ( x " ) ) in N)) implies N is  normal))
proof
let N being (Subgroup of G);
assume that
A1: (for x,y being (Element of G) holds (y in N implies ( ( x * y ) * ( x " ) ) in N));
(for x being (Element of G) holds ( x * N ) c= ( N * x ))
proof
let x being (Element of G);
let z being set;
assume A2: z in ( x * N );
then reconsider z as (Element of G);
consider z1 being (Element of G) such that A3: (z = ( x * z1 ) & z1 in N) by A2,GROUP_2:103;
A4: ( ( x * z1 ) * ( x " ) ) in N by A1,A3;
( ( ( x * z1 ) * ( x " ) ) * x ) = z by A3,GROUP_3:1;
hence thesis by A4,GROUP_2:104;
end;
hence thesis by GROUP_3:118;
