theorem
(for G being Group holds (for A,B being non  empty (Subset of G) holds (for N being  normal (Subgroup of G) holds ( ( N ~ A ) * ( N ~ B ) ) = ( N ~ ( A * B ) ))))
proof
let G being Group;
let A being non  empty (Subset of G);
let B being non  empty (Subset of G);
let N being  normal (Subgroup of G);
thus ( ( N ~ A ) * ( N ~ B ) ) c= ( N ~ ( A * B ) )
proof
let x being set;
assume A1: x in ( ( N ~ A ) * ( N ~ B ) );
then reconsider x as (Element of G);
consider x1,x2 being (Element of G) such that A2: ((x = ( x1 * x2 ) & x1 in ( N ~ A )) & x2 in ( N ~ B )) by A1;
A3: ( x1 * N ) meets A by A2,CKB16:1;
A4: ( x2 * N ) meets B by A2,CKB16:1;
consider x19 being set such that A5: (x19 in ( x1 * N ) & x19 in A) by A3,XBOOLE_0:3;
consider x29 being set such that A6: (x29 in ( x2 * N ) & x29 in B) by A4,XBOOLE_0:3;
reconsider x19 as (Element of G) by A5;
reconsider x29 as (Element of G) by A6;
A7: ( x19 * x29 ) in ( A * B ) by A5,A6;
( x19 * x29 ) in ( ( x1 * N ) * ( x2 * N ) ) by A5,A6;
then ( ( x1 * N ) * ( x2 * N ) ) meets ( A * B ) by A7,XBOOLE_0:3;
then ( ( x1 * x2 ) * N ) meets ( A * B ) by CKB1:1;
hence thesis by A2;
end;

let x being set;
assume A8: x in ( N ~ ( A * B ) );
then reconsider x as (Element of G);
( x * N ) meets ( A * B ) by A8,CKB30:1;
then consider x1 being set such that A9: (x1 in ( x * N ) & x1 in ( A * B )) by XBOOLE_0:3;
reconsider x1 as (Element of G) by A9;
consider y1,y2 being (Element of G) such that A10: ((x1 = ( y1 * y2 ) & y1 in A) & y2 in B) by A9;
( x * N ) = ( ( y1 * y2 ) * N ) by A9,A10,CKB2:1
.= ( ( y1 * N ) * ( y2 * N ) ) by CKB1:1;
then x in ( ( y1 * N ) * ( y2 * N ) ) by GROUP_2:108;
then consider g1,g2 being (Element of G) such that A11: ((x = ( g1 * g2 ) & g1 in ( y1 * N )) & g2 in ( y2 * N ));
(( y1 * N ) = ( g1 * N ) & ( y2 * N ) = ( g2 * N )) by A11,CKB2:1;
then (y1 in ( g1 * N ) & y2 in ( g2 * N )) by GROUP_2:108;
then (( g1 * N ) meets A & ( g2 * N ) meets B) by A10,XBOOLE_0:3;
then (g1 in ( N ~ A ) & g2 in ( N ~ B ));
hence thesis by A11;
