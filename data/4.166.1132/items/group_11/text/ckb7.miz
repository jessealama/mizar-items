theorem
Th7: (for G being Group holds (for N1,N2 being  strict  normal (Subgroup of G) holds (ex M being  strict (Subgroup of G) st (the carrier of M) = ( N1 * N2 ))))
proof
let G being Group;
let N1 being  strict  normal (Subgroup of G),N2 being  strict  normal (Subgroup of G);
A1: ( 1_ G ) in ( N1 * N2 )
proof
A2: (( 1_ G ) in N1 & ( 1_ G ) in N2) by GROUP_2:46;
( ( 1_ G ) * ( 1_ G ) ) = ( 1_ G ) by GROUP_1:def 4;
hence thesis by A2,CKB6:1;
end;
A3: (for x,y being (Element of G) holds ((x in ( N1 * N2 ) & y in ( N1 * N2 )) implies ( x * y ) in ( N1 * N2 )))
proof
let x being (Element of G),y being (Element of G);
assume that
A4: x in ( N1 * N2 )
and
A5: y in ( N1 * N2 );
consider a being (Element of G),b being (Element of G) such that A6: ((x = ( a * b ) & a in N1) & b in N2) by A4,CKB6:1;
consider c being (Element of G),d being (Element of G) such that A7: ((y = ( c * d ) & c in N1) & d in N2) by A5,CKB6:1;
A8: ( x * y ) = ( ( ( a * b ) * c ) * d ) by A6,A7,GROUP_1:def 3
.= ( ( a * ( b * c ) ) * d ) by GROUP_1:def 3;
( b * c ) in ( N2 * N1 ) by A6,A7,CKB6:1;
then ( b * c ) in ( N1 * N2 ) by GROUP_3:125;
then consider b9 being (Element of G),c9 being (Element of G) such that A9: ((( b * c ) = ( b9 * c9 ) & b9 in N1) & c9 in N2) by CKB6:1;
A10: ( x * y ) = ( ( ( a * b9 ) * c9 ) * d ) by A8,A9,GROUP_1:def 3
.= ( ( a * b9 ) * ( c9 * d ) ) by GROUP_1:def 3;
A11: ( a * b9 ) in N1 by A6,A9,GROUP_2:50;
( c9 * d ) in N2 by A7,A9,GROUP_2:50;
hence thesis by A10,A11,CKB6:1;

(for x being (Element of G) holds (x in ( N1 * N2 ) implies ( x " ) in ( N1 * N2 )))
proof
let x being (Element of G);
assume x in ( N1 * N2 );
then consider a being (Element of G),b being (Element of G) such that A12: ((x = ( a * b ) & a in N1) & b in N2) by CKB6:1;
A13: ( x " ) = ( ( b " ) * ( a " ) ) by A12,GROUP_1:17;
(( b " ) in N2 & ( a " ) in N1) by A12,GROUP_2:51;
then ( x " ) in ( N2 * N1 ) by A13,CKB6:1;
hence thesis by GROUP_3:125;

hence thesis by A1,A3,GROUP_2:52;
