theorem
Th8: (for G being Group holds (for N1,N2 being  strict  normal (Subgroup of G) holds (ex M being  strict  normal (Subgroup of G) st (the carrier of M) = ( N1 * N2 ))))
proof
let G being Group;
let N1 being  strict  normal (Subgroup of G),N2 being  strict  normal (Subgroup of G);
consider M being  strict (Subgroup of G) such that A1: (the carrier of M) = ( N1 * N2 ) by CKB7:1;
(for x,y being (Element of G) holds (y in M implies ( ( x * y ) * ( x " ) ) in M))
proof
let x being (Element of G),y being (Element of G);
assume y in M;
then y in (the carrier of M) by STRUCT_0:def 5;
then consider a being (Element of G),b being (Element of G) such that A2: ((y = ( a * b ) & a in N1) & b in N2) by A1,CKB6:1;
A3: ( ( x * y ) * ( x " ) ) = ( ( ( x * a ) * b ) * ( x " ) ) by A2,GROUP_1:def 3
.= ( ( x * a ) * ( b * ( x " ) ) ) by GROUP_1:def 3
.= ( ( ( x * a ) * ( 1_ G ) ) * ( b * ( x " ) ) ) by GROUP_1:def 4
.= ( ( ( x * a ) * ( ( x " ) * x ) ) * ( b * ( x " ) ) ) by GROUP_1:def 5
.= ( ( ( ( x * a ) * ( x " ) ) * x ) * ( b * ( x " ) ) ) by GROUP_1:def 3
.= ( ( ( x * a ) * ( x " ) ) * ( x * ( b * ( x " ) ) ) ) by GROUP_1:def 3
.= ( ( ( x * a ) * ( x " ) ) * ( ( x * b ) * ( x " ) ) ) by GROUP_1:def 3;
(( ( x * a ) * ( x " ) ) in N1 & ( ( x * b ) * ( x " ) ) in N2) by A2,CKB4:1;
then ( ( x * y ) * ( x " ) ) in ( N1 * N2 ) by A3,CKB6:1;
hence thesis by A1,STRUCT_0:def 5;
end;
then M is  normal  normal (Subgroup of G) by CKB5:1;
hence thesis by A1;
