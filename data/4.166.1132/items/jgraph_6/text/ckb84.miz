Th68: (for a,b,c,d being  real number holds (for p1,p2 being (Point of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) holds ((((a < b & c < d) & p1 in ( LSeg (|[ a,c ]|,|[ b,c ]|) )) & p2 in ( LSeg (|[ a,c ]|,|[ b,c ]|) )) implies (( LE p1,p2,( rectangle (a,b,c,d) ) & p1 <> ( W-min ( rectangle (a,b,c,d) ) )) iff (( p1 `1 ) >= ( p2 `1 ) & p2 <> ( W-min ( rectangle (a,b,c,d) ) ))))))
