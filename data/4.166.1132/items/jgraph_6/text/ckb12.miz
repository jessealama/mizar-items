Th17: (for X being non  empty TopSpace holds (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL n )) holds (for f being (Function of X,( R^1 )) holds (f is  continuous implies (ex g being (Function of X,( TOP-REAL n )) st ((for r being (Point of X) holds ( g . r ) = ( ( f . r ) * p )) & g is  continuous)))))))
proof
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
let p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL n ));
let f being (Function of X,( R^1 ));

(ex g being (Function of (the carrier of X),(the carrier of ( TOP-REAL n ))) st (for x being (Element of X) holds P[ x,( g . x ) ])) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A2);
then consider g being (Function of (the carrier of X),(the carrier of ( TOP-REAL n ))) such that A3: (for x being (Element of X) holds P[ x,( g . x ) ]);
reconsider g as (Function of X,( TOP-REAL n ));
(for r0 being (Point of X) holds (for V being (Subset of ( TOP-REAL n )) holds ((( g . r0 ) in V & V is  open) implies (ex W being (Subset of X) st ((r0 in W & W is  open) & ( g .: W ) c= V)))))
proof
let r0 being (Point of X);
let V being (Subset of ( TOP-REAL n ));

proof
let y being set;

proof
let r being (Point of X);

proof
let y being set;
assume y in ( g .: W2 );
then (ex x being set st ((x in ( dom g ) & x in W2) & y = ( g . x ))) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
hence thesis by A23,A24;

hence thesis;
