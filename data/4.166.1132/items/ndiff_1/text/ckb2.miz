theorem
Th2: (for X being (Subset of S) holds (X is  open implies (for r being (Point of S) holds (r in X implies (ex N being (Neighbourhood of r) st N c= X)))))
proof
let X being (Subset of S);
assume X is  open;
then A1: ( X ` ) is  closed by NFCONT_1:def 4;
let r being (Point of S);
assume that
A2: r in X
and
A3: (for N being (Neighbourhood of r) holds (not N c= X));
defpred P[ (Element of ( NAT )),(Point of S) ]
 means
($2 in { y where y is (Point of S): ||. ( y - r ) .|| < ( 1 / ( $1 + 1 ) ) } & $2 in ( X ` ));
A4:now
let g being Real;
assume that
A5: ( 0 ) < g;
set N = { y where y is (Point of S): ||. ( y - r ) .|| < g };
N is (Neighbourhood of r) by A5,NFCONT_1:3;
then (not N c= X) by A3;
then consider x being set such that A6: x in N and A7: (not x in X) by TARSKI:def 3;
consider s being (Point of S) such that A8: x = s and A9: ||. ( s - r ) .|| < g by A6;
take s;
thus s in N by A9;
thus s in ( X ` ) by A7,A8,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
A10: (for n holds (ex s being (Point of S) st P[ n,s ]))
proof
let n;
( 0 ) <= n by NAT_1:2;
then ( 0 ) < ( 1 * ( ( n + 1 ) " ) );
then ( 0 ) < ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ) by XCMPLX_0:def 9;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
consider s1 being (sequence of S) such that A11: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ n,( s1 . n ) ]) from FUNCT_2:sch 3(A10);
A12: ( rng s1 ) c= ( X ` )
proof
let x;
assume x in ( rng s1 );
then consider y being set such that A13: y in ( dom s1 ) and A14: ( s1 . y ) = x by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider y as (Element of ( NAT )) by A13;
( s1 . y ) in ( X ` ) by A11;
hence thesis by A14;
end;
A15:now
let p being Real;
assume A16: ( 0 ) < p;
consider n such that A17: ( p " ) < n by SEQ_4:3;
( ( p " ) + ( 0 ) ) < ( n + 1 ) by A17,XREAL_1:8;
then ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ) < ( 1 / ( p " ) ) by A16,XREAL_1:76;
then A18: ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ) < p by XCMPLX_1:216;
take n;
let m being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume n <= m;
then A19: ( n + 1 ) <= ( m + 1 ) by XREAL_1:6;
( s1 . m ) in { y where y is (Point of S): ||. ( y - r ) .|| < ( 1 / ( m + 1 ) ) } by A11;
then A20: (ex y being (Point of S) st (( s1 . m ) = y & ||. ( y - r ) .|| < ( 1 / ( m + 1 ) )));
( 0 ) <= n by NAT_1:2;
then ( 1 / ( m + 1 ) ) <= ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ) by A19,XREAL_1:118;
then ||. ( ( s1 . m ) - r ) .|| < ( 1 / ( n + 1 ) ) by A20,XXREAL_0:2;
hence ||. ( ( s1 . m ) - r ) .|| < p by A18,XXREAL_0:2;
end;
then A21: s1 is  convergent by NORMSP_1:def 6;
then ( lim s1 ) = r by A15,NORMSP_1:def 7;
then r in ( X ` ) by A21,A12,A1,NFCONT_1:def 3;
hence contradiction by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
