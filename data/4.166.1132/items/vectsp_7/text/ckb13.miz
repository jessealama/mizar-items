theorem
Th13: (x in A implies x in ( Lin A ))
proof
deffunc F(set) = ( 0. GF );
assume A1: x in A;
then reconsider v = x as (Vector of V);
consider f being (Function of (the carrier of V),(the carrier of GF)) such that A2: ( f . v ) = ( 1_ GF ) and A3: (for u holds (u <> v implies ( f . u ) = F(u))) from FUNCT_2:sch 6;
reconsider f as (Element of ( Funcs ((the carrier of V),(the carrier of GF)) )) by FUNCT_2:8;
(ex T st (for u holds ((not u in T) implies ( f . u ) = ( 0. GF ))))
proof
take T = { v };
let u;
assume (not u in T);
then u <> v by TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
then reconsider f as (Linear_Combination of V) by VECTSP_6:def 1;
A4: ( Carrier f ) c= { v }
proof
let x;
assume x in ( Carrier f );
then consider u such that A5: x = u and A6: ( f . u ) <> ( 0. GF );
u = v by A3,A6;
hence thesis by A5,TARSKI:def 1;
end;

{ v } c= A by A1,ZFMISC_1:31;
then ( Carrier f ) c= A by A4,XBOOLE_1:1;
then reconsider f as (Linear_Combination of A) by VECTSP_6:def 4;
( Sum f ) = v by A7;
hence thesis by CKB12:1;
