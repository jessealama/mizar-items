func Lin A ->  strict (Subspace of V) means 
:Def2: (the carrier of it) = { ( Sum l ): (not contradiction) };
existence
proof
set A1 = { ( Sum l ): (not contradiction) };
A1 c= (the carrier of V)
proof
let x;
assume x in A1;
then (ex l st x = ( Sum l ));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider A1 as (Subset of V);
reconsider l = ( ZeroLC V ) as (Linear_Combination of A) by VECTSP_6:5;
A1: A1 is  linearly-closed
proof
thus (for v holds (for u holds ((v in A1 & u in A1) implies ( v + u ) in A1)))
proof
let v;
let u;
assume that
A2: v in A1
and
A3: u in A1;
consider l1 being (Linear_Combination of A) such that A4: v = ( Sum l1 ) by A2;
consider l2 being (Linear_Combination of A) such that A5: u = ( Sum l2 ) by A3;
reconsider f = ( l1 + l2 ) as (Linear_Combination of A) by VECTSP_6:24;
( v + u ) = ( Sum f ) by A4,A5,VECTSP_6:44;
hence thesis;
end;

let a;
let v;
assume v in A1;
then consider l such that A6: v = ( Sum l );
reconsider f = ( a * l ) as (Linear_Combination of A) by VECTSP_6:31;
( a * v ) = ( Sum f ) by A6,VECTSP_6:45;
hence thesis;
end;
( Sum l ) = ( 0. V ) by VECTSP_6:15;
