theorem
(for a being Real holds (for i being Nat holds (for A being (Matrix of ( REAL )) holds ((( len A ) > ( 0 ) & i in ( dom A )) implies ((ex p being (FinSequence of ( REAL )) st p = ( A . i )) & (for q being (FinSequence of ( REAL )) holds (q = ( A . i ) implies ( ( a * A ) . i ) = ( a * q ))))))))
proof
let a being Real;
let i being Nat;
let A being (Matrix of ( REAL ));
assume that
A1: ( len A ) > ( 0 )
and
A2: i in ( dom A );
consider n3 being Nat such that A3: (for x being set holds (x in ( rng A ) implies (ex s2 being FinSequence st (s2 = x & ( len s2 ) = n3)))) by MATRIX_1:def 1;
( A . i ) in ( rng A ) by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then A4: (ex qq0 being FinSequence st (qq0 = ( A . i ) & ( len qq0 ) = n3)) by A3;
( len ( a * A ) ) = ( len A ) by CKB34:1;
then consider s being FinSequence such that A5: s in ( rng ( a * A ) ) and A6: ( len s ) = ( width ( a * A ) ) by A1,MATRIX_1:def 3;
A7: ( width ( a * A ) ) = ( width A ) by CKB34:1;
consider s3 being FinSequence such that A8: s3 in ( rng A ) and A9: ( len s3 ) = ( width A ) by A1,MATRIX_1:def 3;
consider n2 being Nat such that A10: (for x being set holds (x in ( rng ( a * A ) ) implies (ex s2 being FinSequence st (s2 = x & ( len s2 ) = n2)))) by MATRIX_1:def 1;
( len ( a * A ) ) = ( len A ) by CKB34:1;
then A11: ( dom ( a * A ) ) = ( dom A ) by FINSEQ_3:29;
then ( ( a * A ) . i ) in ( rng ( a * A ) ) by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then consider qq being FinSequence such that A12: qq = ( ( a * A ) . i ) and A13: ( len qq ) = n2 by A10;
consider n being Nat such that A14: (for x being set holds (x in ( rng A ) implies (ex p being (FinSequence of ( REAL )) st (x = p & ( len p ) = n)))) by MATRIX_1:9;
( A . i ) in ( rng A ) by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then (ex p2 being (FinSequence of ( REAL )) st (( A . i ) = p2 & ( len p2 ) = n)) by A14;
hence (ex p being (FinSequence of ( REAL )) st p = ( A . i ));
let q being (FinSequence of ( REAL ));
assume A15: q = ( A . i );
A16: (ex s4 being FinSequence st (s4 = s3 & ( len s4 ) = n3)) by A8,A3;
then A17: ( len ( a * q ) ) = ( width A ) by A15,A9,A4,RVSUM_1:117;
A18: (for j being Nat holds ((1 <= j & j <= ( len ( a * q ) )) implies ( qq . j ) = ( ( a * q ) . j )))
proof
let j being Nat;
assume (1 <= j & j <= ( len ( a * q ) ));
then A19: j in ( Seg ( width A ) ) by A17,FINSEQ_1:1;
then A20: [ i,j ] in ( Indices A ) by A2,ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider j as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
[ i,j ] in ( Indices ( a * A ) ) by A2,A7,A11,A19,ZFMISC_1:87;
then A21: (ex p being (FinSequence of ( REAL )) st (p = ( ( a * A ) . i ) & ( ( a * A ) * (i,j) ) = ( p . j ))) by MATRIX_1:def 5;
(ex p2 being (FinSequence of ( REAL )) st (p2 = ( A . i ) & ( A * (i,j) ) = ( p2 . j ))) by A20,MATRIX_1:def 5;
then ( qq . j ) = ( a * ( q . j ) ) by A15,A12,A20,A21,CKB36:1;
hence thesis by RVSUM_1:44;
end;
(ex s2 being FinSequence st (s2 = s & ( len s2 ) = n2)) by A5,A10;
then ( width A ) = ( len qq ) by A6,A13,CKB34:1;
hence thesis by A15,A9,A16,A12,A4,A18,FINSEQ_1:14,RVSUM_1:117;
