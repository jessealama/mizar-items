func dist_cart2S (X,Y) -> (Function of [: [: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of Y) :],[: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of Y) :] :],( REAL ))
means
:Def10: (for x1,y1 being (Element of X) holds (for x2,y2 being (Element of Y) holds (for x,y being (Element of [: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of Y) :]) holds ((x = [ x1,x2 ] & y = [ y1,y2 ]) implies ( it . (x,y) ) = ( sqrt ( ( ( dist (x1,y1) ) ^2 ) + ( ( dist (x2,y2) ) ^2 ) ) )))));
existence
proof
deffunc G((Element of X),(Element of X),(Element of Y),(Element of Y)) = ( sqrt ( ( ( dist ($1,$2) ) ^2 ) + ( ( dist ($3,$4) ) ^2 ) ) );
consider F being (Function of [: [: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of Y) :],[: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of Y) :] :],( REAL )) such that A1: (for x1,y1 being (Element of X) holds (for x2,y2 being (Element of Y) holds (for x,y being (Element of [: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of Y) :]) holds ((x = [ x1,x2 ] & y = [ y1,y2 ]) implies ( F .

take F;
let x1 being (Element of X),y1 being (Element of X);
let x2 being (Element of Y),y2 being (Element of Y);

uniqueness
proof

(for x,y being (Element of [: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of Y) :]) holds ( f1 . (x,y) ) = ( f2 . (x,y) ))
proof
let x being (Element of [: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of Y) :]),y being (Element of [: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of Y) :]);
consider x1 being (Element of X),x2 being (Element of Y) such that A4: x = [ x1,x2 ] by DOMAIN_1:1;
consider y1 being (Element of X),y2 being (Element of Y) such that A5: y = [ y1,y2 ] by DOMAIN_1:1;
thus ( f1 . (x,y) ) = ( sqrt ( ( ( dist (x1,y1) ) ^2 ) + ( ( dist (x2,y2) ) ^2 ) ) ) by A2,A4,A5
.= ( f2 . (x,y) ) by A3,A4,A5;
