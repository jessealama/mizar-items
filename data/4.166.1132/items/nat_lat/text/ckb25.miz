reserve n for Nat;
definition
func NATPLUS -> (Subset of ( NAT )) means 
:Def9: (for n being Nat holds (n in it iff ( 0 ) < n));
existence
proof
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
( 0 ) < $1;
consider X being (Subset of ( NAT )) such that A1: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n in X iff P[ n ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
take X;
let n being Nat;
thus (n in X implies ( 0 ) < n) by A1;
n in ( NAT ) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let X being (Subset of ( NAT ));
let Y being (Subset of ( NAT ));
assume that
A2: (for n being Nat holds (n in X iff ( 0 ) < n))
and
A3: (for n being Nat holds (n in Y iff ( 0 ) < n));
thus X c= Y
proof
let x being set;
assume A4: x in X;
then reconsider x as Nat;
( 0 ) < x by A2,A4;
hence thesis by A3;
end;

let x being set;
assume A5: x in Y;
then reconsider x as Nat;
( 0 ) < x by A3,A5;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
end;
