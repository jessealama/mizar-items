reserve X for set;
reserve C for (C_Measure of X);
theorem
Th12: (for W,Z being (Subset of X) holds ( C . ( W \/ Z ) ) <= ( ( C . W ) + ( C . Z ) ))
proof
let W being (Subset of X),Z being (Subset of X);
reconsider P = ( {} ) as (Subset of X) by XBOOLE_1:2;
consider F being (Function of ( NAT ),( bool X )) such that A1: ( rng F ) = { W,Z,P } and A2: ( F . ( 0 ) ) = W and A3: ( F . 1 ) = Z and A4: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (1 < n implies ( F . n ) = P)) by MEASURE1:17;
A5: ( ( C * F ) . 1 ) = ( C . Z ) by A3,FUNCT_2:15;
set G = ( C * F );
A6: ( union { W,Z,P } ) = ( W \/ Z )
proof
thus ( union { W,Z,P } ) c= ( W \/ Z )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( union { W,Z,P } );
then (ex Y being set st (x in Y & Y in { W,Z,P })) by TARSKI:def 4;
then ((x in W or x in Z) or x in P) by ENUMSET1:def 1;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;

let x being set;
assume A7: x in ( W \/ Z );
now
per cases  by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A8: x in W;

take Y = W;
thus (x in Y & Y in { W,Z,P }) by A8,ENUMSET1:def 1;
end;
suppose A9: x in Z;

take Y = Z;
thus (x in Y & Y in { W,Z,P }) by A9,ENUMSET1:def 1;
end;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 4;
end;
A10: C is  zeroed by CKB4:def 1;
A11: (for r being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (2 <= r implies ( ( C * F ) . r ) = ( 0. )))
proof
let r being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume 2 <= r;
then ( 1 + 1 ) <= r;
then 1 < r by NAT_1:13;
then A12: ( F . r ) = ( {} ) by A4;
C is  zeroed by CKB4:def 1;
then ( C . ( F . r ) ) = ( 0. ) by A12,VALUED_0:def 19;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:15;
end;
C is  nonnegative by CKB4:def 1;
then A13: ( C * F ) is  nonnegative by MEASURE1:25;
( F . 2 ) = P by A4;
then A14: ( ( C * F ) . 2 ) = ( C . P ) by FUNCT_2:15;
A15: ( ( C * F ) . ( 0 ) ) = ( C . W ) by A2,FUNCT_2:15;
consider y1 being R_eal,y2 being R_eal such that A16: y1 = ( ( Ser G ) . 1 ) and A17: y2 = ( ( Ser G ) . ( 0 ) );
( ( Ser G ) . 2 ) = ( y1 + ( G . ( 1 + 1 ) ) ) by A16,SUPINF_2:44
.= ( ( ( Ser G ) . 1 ) + ( 0. ) ) by A14,A16,A10,VALUED_0:def 19
.= ( ( Ser G ) . 1 ) by XXREAL_3:4
.= ( y2 + ( G . ( ( 0 ) + 1 ) ) ) by A17,SUPINF_2:44
.= ( ( C . W ) + ( C . Z ) ) by A5,A15,A17,SUPINF_2:44;
then ( SUM ( C * F ) ) = ( ( C . W ) + ( C . Z ) ) by A13,A11,SUPINF_2:48;
hence thesis by A1,A6,CKB4:def 1;
