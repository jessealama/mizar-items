theorem
Th4: (for S being non empty (Subset-Family of X) holds (for F,G being (Function of ( NAT ),S) holds (for A being (Element of S) holds ((for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( G . n ) = ( A /\ ( F . n ) )) implies ( union ( rng G ) ) = ( A /\ ( union ( rng F ) ) )))))
proof
let S being non empty (Subset-Family of X);
let F being (Function of ( NAT ),S),G being (Function of ( NAT ),S);
let A being (Element of S);
assume A1: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( G . n ) = ( A /\ ( F . n ) ));
thus ( union ( rng G ) ) c= ( A /\ ( union ( rng F ) ) )
proof
let r being set;
assume r in ( union ( rng G ) );
then consider E being set such that A2: r in E and A3: E in ( rng G ) by TARSKI:def 4;
consider s being set such that A4: s in ( dom G ) and A5: E = ( G . s ) by A3,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider s as (Element of ( NAT )) by A4;
A6: r in ( A /\ ( F . s ) ) by A1,A2,A5;
then A7: r in A by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A8: ( F . s ) in ( rng F ) by FUNCT_2:4;
r in ( F . s ) by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then r in ( union ( rng F ) ) by A8,TARSKI:def 4;
hence thesis by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;

let r being set;
assume A9: r in ( A /\ ( union ( rng F ) ) );
then A10: r in A by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
r in ( union ( rng F ) ) by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider E being set such that A11: r in E and A12: E in ( rng F ) by TARSKI:def 4;
consider s being set such that A13: s in ( dom F ) and A14: E = ( F . s ) by A12,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider s as (Element of ( NAT )) by A13;
A15: ( G . s ) in ( rng G ) by FUNCT_2:4;
( A /\ E ) = ( G . s ) by A1,A14;
then r in ( G . s ) by A10,A11,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by A15,TARSKI:def 4;
