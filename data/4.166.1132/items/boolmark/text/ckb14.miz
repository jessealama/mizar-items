theorem
(for PTN being Petri_net holds (for Sd being non  empty (Subset of (the carrier of PTN)) holds (Sd is  Deadlock-like iff (for M0 being (Boolean_marking of PTN) holds (( M0 .: Sd ) = { ( FALSE ) } implies (for t being (transition of PTN) holds (t is_firable_on M0 implies ( ( Firing (t,M0) ) .: Sd ) = { ( FALSE ) })))))))
proof
let PTN being Petri_net;
let Sd being non  empty (Subset of (the carrier of PTN));
thus (Sd is  Deadlock-like implies (for M0 being (Boolean_marking of PTN) holds (( M0 .: Sd ) = { ( FALSE ) } implies (for t being (transition of PTN) holds (t is_firable_on M0 implies ( ( Firing (t,M0) ) .: Sd ) = { ( FALSE ) })))))
proof
assume Sd is  Deadlock-like;
then A1: ( *' Sd ) is (Subset of ( Sd *' )) by PETRI:def 8;
let M0 being (Boolean_marking of PTN);
assume that
A2: ( M0 .: Sd ) = { ( FALSE ) };
let t being (transition of PTN);
assume t is_firable_on M0;
then ( M0 .: ( *' { t } ) ) c= { ( TRUE ) } by CKB6:def 1;
then A3: ( M0 .: ( *' { t } ) ) misses { ( FALSE ) } by XBOOLE_1:63,ZFMISC_1:11;
then ( *' { t } ) misses Sd by A2,CKB2:1;
then (not t in ( *' Sd )) by A1,PETRI:19;
then ( { t } *' ) misses Sd by PETRI:20;
hence ( ( Firing (t,M0) ) .: Sd ) = ( ( M0 +* ( ( *' { t } ) --> ( FALSE ) ) ) .: Sd ) by CKB3:1
.= { ( FALSE ) } by A2,A3,CKB2:1,CKB3:1;

thus thesis by Lm1;
