let V being  finite-dimensional RealUnitarySpace;
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
func n Subspaces_of V -> set means

existence
proof
set S = { ( Lin A ) where A is (Subset of V): (A is  linearly-independent & ( card A ) = n) };
take S;
(for x being set holds (x in S iff (ex W being  strict (Subspace of V) st (W = x & ( dim W ) = n))))
proof
let x being set;
hereby
assume x in S;
then A1: (ex A being (Subset of V) st ((x = ( Lin A ) & A is  linearly-independent) & ( card A ) = n));
then reconsider W = x as  strict (Subspace of V);
( dim W ) = n by A1,CKB17:1;
hence (ex W being  strict (Subspace of V) st (W = x & ( dim W ) = n));
end;
given W being  strict (Subspace of V) such that
A2: W = x
and
A3: ( dim W ) = n;

consider A being  finite (Subset of W) such that A4: A is (Basis of W) by CKB5:def 1;
reconsider A as (Subset of W);
A is  linearly-independent by A4,RUSUB_3:def 2;
then reconsider B = A as  linearly-independent (Subset of V) by RUSUB_3:22;
A5: x = ( Lin A ) by A2,A4,RUSUB_3:def 2
.= ( Lin B ) by RUSUB_3:28;
then ( card B ) = n by A2,A3,CKB17:1;
hence thesis by A5;
end;
hence thesis;

uniqueness
proof
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex W being  strict (Subspace of V) st (W = $1 & ( dim W ) = n));
(for X1,X2 being set holds (((for x being set holds (x in X1 iff P[ x ])) & (for x being set holds (x in X2 iff P[ x ]))) implies X1 = X2)) from XBOOLE_0:sch 3;
hence thesis;
