theorem
Th42: (for S1,S2 being non void non empty ManySortedSign holds (for X being  non-empty (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of S2)) holds (for f being (Function of (the carrier of S1),(the carrier of S2)) holds (for g being Function holds (f,g form_morphism_between S1,S2 implies (for t being (Term of S1,( X * f )) holds (( ( ( hom (f,g,X,S1,S2) ) . ( the_sort_of t ) ) . t ) is (CompoundTerm of S2,X) iff t is (CompoundTerm of S1,( X * f )))))))))
proof
let S1 being non void non empty ManySortedSign,S2 being non void non empty ManySortedSign;
let X being  non-empty (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of S2));
let f being (Function of (the carrier of S1),(the carrier of S2));
let g being Function;
assume A1: f,g form_morphism_between S1,S2;
then reconsider h = g as (Function of (the carrier' of S1),(the carrier' of S2)) by CKB16:1;
let t being (Term of S1,( X * f ));
hereby
assume ( ( ( hom (f,g,X,S1,S2) ) . ( the_sort_of t ) ) . t ) is (CompoundTerm of S2,X);
then reconsider w = ( ( ( hom (f,g,X,S1,S2) ) . ( the_sort_of t ) ) . t ) as (CompoundTerm of S2,X);
assume (not t is (CompoundTerm of S1,( X * f )));
then (not ( t . ( {} ) ) in [: (the carrier' of S1),{ (the carrier of S1) } :]) by MSATERM:def 6;
then consider s being (SortSymbol of S1),v being (Element of ( ( X * f ) . s )) such that A2: ( t . ( {} ) ) = [ v,s ] by MSATERM:2;
t = ( root-tree [ v,s ] ) by A2,MSATERM:5;
then (( ( ( hom (f,g,X,S1,S2) ) . s ) . t ) = ( root-tree [ v,( f . s ) ] ) & ( the_sort_of t ) = s) by A1,CKB57:def 1,MSATERM:14;
then (( w . ( {} ) ) in [: (the carrier' of S2),{ (the carrier of S2) } :] & ( w . ( {} ) ) = [ v,( f . s ) ]) by MSATERM:def 6,TREES_4:3;
then A3: ( f . s ) = (the carrier of S2) by ZFMISC_1:106;
( f . s ) in (the carrier of S2);
hence contradiction by A3;
end;
assume t is (CompoundTerm of S1,( X * f ));
then reconsider t as (CompoundTerm of S1,( X * f ));
( t . ( {} ) ) in [: (the carrier' of S1),{ (the carrier of S1) } :] by MSATERM:def 6;
then consider o being set,r being set such that A4: o in (the carrier' of S1) and A5: r in { (the carrier of S1) } and A6: ( t . ( {} ) ) = [ o,r ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider o as (OperSymbol of S1) by A4;
r = (the carrier of S1) by A5,TARSKI:def 1;
then consider a being (ArgumentSeq of ( Sym (o,( X * f )) )) such that A7: t = ( [ o,(the carrier of S1) ] -tree a ) by A6,MSATERM:10;
reconsider a as (Element of ( Args (o,( FreeMSA ( X * f ) )) )) by CKB1:1;
reconsider b = ( ( hom (f,g,X,S1,S2) ) # a ) as (Element of ( Args (( h . o ),( FreeMSA X )) )) by A1,CKB38:1;
A8: ( ( ( hom (f,g,X,S1,S2) ) . ( the_result_sort_of o ) ) . ( [ o,(the carrier of S1) ] -tree a ) ) = ( [ ( g . o ),(the carrier of S2) ] -tree b ) by A1,CKB58:1;
( t . ( {} ) ) = [ o,(the carrier of S1) ] by A7,TREES_4:def 4;
then A9: ( the_sort_of t ) = ( the_result_sort_of o ) by MSATERM:17;
reconsider b as (ArgumentSeq of ( Sym (( h . o ),X) )) by CKB1:1;
( ( Sym (( h . o ),X) ) -tree b ) = ( [ ( h . o ),(the carrier of S2) ] -tree b ) by MSAFREE:def 9;
then reconsider T = ( [ ( h . o ),(the carrier of S2) ] -tree b ) as (Term of S2,X);
(( T . ( {} ) ) = [ ( g . o ),(the carrier of S2) ] & [ ( h . o ),(the carrier of S2) ] in [: (the carrier' of S2),{ (the carrier of S2) } :]) by TREES_4:def 4,ZFMISC_1:106;
hence thesis by A7,A9,A8,MSATERM:def 6;
