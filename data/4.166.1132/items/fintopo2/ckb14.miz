theorem
(for x being (Element of FT) holds (for A being (Subset of FT) holds (x in ( A ^b ) iff (ex y1 being (Element of FT) st ( P_1 (x,y1,A) ) = ( TRUE )))))
proof
let x being (Element of FT);
let A being (Subset of FT);
A1: (x in ( A ^b ) implies (ex y1 being (Element of FT) st ( P_1 (x,y1,A) ) = ( TRUE )))
proof
reconsider z = x as (Element of FT);
assume x in ( A ^b );
then ( U_FT z ) meets A by FIN_TOPO:8;
then consider w being set such that A2: w in ( U_FT z ) and A3: w in A by XBOOLE_0:3;
reconsider w as (Element of FT) by A2;
take w;
thus thesis by A2,A3,CKB6:def 1;
end;
((ex y1 being (Element of FT) st ( P_1 (x,y1,A) ) = ( TRUE )) implies x in ( A ^b ))
proof
given y being (Element of FT) such that
A4: ( P_1 (x,y,A) ) = ( TRUE );

(y in ( U_FT x ) & y in A) by A4,CKB6:def 1;
then y in ( ( U_FT x ) /\ A ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then ( U_FT x ) meets A by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
