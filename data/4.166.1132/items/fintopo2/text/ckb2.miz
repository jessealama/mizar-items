begin
reserve FT for non empty RelStr;
reserve A for (Subset of FT);
theorem
Th2: ( A ^delta ) = ( ( A ^b ) /\ ( ( A ^i ) ` ) )
proof
(for x being set holds (x in ( A ^delta ) iff x in ( ( A ^b ) /\ ( ( A ^i ) ` ) )))
proof
let x being set;
thus (x in ( A ^delta ) implies x in ( ( A ^b ) /\ ( ( A ^i ) ` ) ))
proof
assume A1: x in ( A ^delta );
then reconsider y = x as (Element of FT);
( U_FT y ) meets ( A ` ) by A1,FIN_TOPO:5;
then y in ( ( ( ( A ` ) ^b ) ` ) ` );
then A2: y in ( ( A ^i ) ` ) by FIN_TOPO:17;
( U_FT y ) meets A by A1,FIN_TOPO:5;
then y in ( A ^b );
hence thesis by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;

assume A3: x in ( ( A ^b ) /\ ( ( A ^i ) ` ) );
then reconsider y = x as (Element of FT);
x in ( ( A ^i ) ` ) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then x in ( ( ( ( A ` ) ^b ) ` ) ` ) by FIN_TOPO:17;
then A4: ( U_FT y ) meets ( A ` ) by FIN_TOPO:8;
x in ( A ^b ) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then ( U_FT y ) meets A by FIN_TOPO:8;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
