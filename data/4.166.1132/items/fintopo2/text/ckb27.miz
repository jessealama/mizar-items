definition
let T;
func NeighSp T -> non  empty  strict FMT_Space_Str means 
((the carrier of it) = (the carrier of T) & (for x being (Point of it) holds ( U_FMT x ) = { V where V is (Subset of T): (V in (the topology of T) & x in V) }));
existence
proof
(ex IT being non  empty  strict FMT_Space_Str st ((the carrier of IT) = (the carrier of T) & (for x being (Point of IT) holds ( U_FMT x ) = { V where V is (Subset of T): (V in (the topology of T) & x in V) })))
proof
deffunc F(set) = { V where V is (Subset of T): (V in (the topology of T) & $1 in V) };
A1: (for x being (Element of T) holds F(x) in ( bool ( bool (the carrier of T) ) ))
proof
let x being (Element of T);
now
let Y being set;
assume Y in { V where V is (Subset of T): (V in (the topology of T) & x in V) };
then (ex V being (Subset of T) st ((V = Y & V in (the topology of T)) & x in V));
hence Y in ( bool (the carrier of T) );
end;
then { V where V is (Subset of T): (V in (the topology of T) & x in V) } c= ( bool (the carrier of T) ) by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis;
end;
consider f being (Function of (the carrier of T),( bool ( bool (the carrier of T) ) )) such that A2: (for x being (Element of T) holds ( f . x ) = F(x)) from FUNCT_2:sch 8(A1);
reconsider IT = FMT_Space_Str (# (the carrier of T),f #) as non  empty  strict FMT_Space_Str;
take IT;
thus thesis by A2;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let it1 being non  empty  strict FMT_Space_Str;
let it2 being non  empty  strict FMT_Space_Str;
assume that
A3: (the carrier of it1) = (the carrier of T)
and
A4: (for x being (Point of it1) holds ( U_FMT x ) = { V where V is (Subset of T): (V in (the topology of T) & x in V) })
and
A5: (the carrier of it2) = (the carrier of T)
and
A6: (for x being (Point of it2) holds ( U_FMT x ) = { V where V is (Subset of T): (V in (the topology of T) & x in V) });
A7: (for x being (Element of it2) holds ( (the BNbd of it2) . x ) = { V where V is (Subset of T): (V in (the topology of T) & x in V) })
proof
let x being (Element of it2);
( (the BNbd of it2) . x ) = ( U_FMT x );
hence thesis by A6;
end;
A8: (for x being (Element of it1) holds ( (the BNbd of it1) . x ) = { V where V is (Subset of T): (V in (the topology of T) & x in V) })
proof
let x being (Element of it1);
( (the BNbd of it1) . x ) = ( U_FMT x );
hence thesis by A4;
end;
now
let x being (Point of it1);
thus ( (the BNbd of it1) . x ) = { V where V is (Subset of T): (V in (the topology of T) & x in V) } by A8
.= ( (the BNbd of it2) . x ) by A3,A5,A7;
