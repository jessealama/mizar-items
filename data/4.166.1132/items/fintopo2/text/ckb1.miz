begin
reserve FT for non  empty RelStr;
reserve A for (Subset of FT);
theorem
(for FT being non  empty RelStr holds (for A,B being (Subset of FT) holds (A c= B implies ( A ^i ) c= ( B ^i ))))
proof
let FT being non  empty RelStr;
let A being (Subset of FT);
let B being (Subset of FT);
assume A1: A c= B;
let x being set;
assume A2: x in ( A ^i );
then reconsider y = x as (Element of FT);
A3: ( U_FT y ) c= A by A2,FIN_TOPO:7;
(for t being (Element of FT) holds (t in ( U_FT y ) implies t in B))
proof
let t being (Element of FT);
assume t in ( U_FT y );
then t in A by A3;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
then ( U_FT y ) c= B by SUBSET_1:2;
hence thesis;
end;
