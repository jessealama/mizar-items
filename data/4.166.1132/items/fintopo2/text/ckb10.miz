theorem
Th8: (for x being (Element of FT) holds (for A being (Subset of FT) holds (x in ( A ^delta ) iff (ex y1,y2 being (Element of FT) st (( P_1 (x,y1,A) ) = ( TRUE ) & ( P_2 (x,y2,A) ) = ( TRUE ))))))
proof
let x being (Element of FT);
let A being (Subset of FT);
A1: (x in ( A ^delta ) implies (ex y1,y2 being (Element of FT) st (( P_1 (x,y1,A) ) = ( TRUE ) & ( P_2 (x,y2,A) ) = ( TRUE ))))
proof
reconsider z = x as (Element of FT);
assume A2: x in ( A ^delta );
then ( U_FT z ) meets A by FIN_TOPO:5;
then consider w1 being set such that A3: w1 in ( U_FT z ) and A4: w1 in A by XBOOLE_0:3;
reconsider w1 as (Element of FT) by A3;
take w1;
( U_FT z ) meets ( A ` ) by A2,FIN_TOPO:5;
then consider w2 being set such that A5: (w2 in ( U_FT z ) & w2 in ( A ` )) by XBOOLE_0:3;
take w2;
thus thesis by A3,A4,A5,CKB6:def 1,CKB7:def 1;
end;
((ex y1,y2 being (Element of FT) st (( P_1 (x,y1,A) ) = ( TRUE ) & ( P_2 (x,y2,A) ) = ( TRUE ))) implies x in ( A ^delta ))
proof
given y1 being (Element of FT),y2 being (Element of FT) such that
A6: ( P_1 (x,y1,A) ) = ( TRUE )
and
A7: ( P_2 (x,y2,A) ) = ( TRUE );

(y1 in ( U_FT x ) & y1 in A) by A6,CKB6:def 1;
then ( ( U_FT x ) /\ A ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A8: ( U_FT x ) meets A by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
(y2 in ( U_FT x ) & y2 in ( A ` )) by A7,CKB7:def 1;
then ( U_FT x ) meets ( A ` ) by XBOOLE_0:3;
hence thesis by A8;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
