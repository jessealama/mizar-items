theorem
(for FMT being non  empty FMT_Space_Str holds (for A,B being (Subset of FMT) holds ((for x being (Element of FMT) holds (for V1,V2 being (Subset of FMT) holds ((V1 in ( U_FMT x ) & V2 in ( U_FMT x )) implies (ex W being (Subset of FMT) st (W in ( U_FMT x ) & W c= ( V1 /\ V2 )))))) implies ( ( A \/ B ) ^Fodelta ) c= ( ( A ^Fodelta ) \/ ( B ^Fodelta ) ))))
proof
let FMT being non  empty FMT_Space_Str;
let A being (Subset of FMT);
let B being (Subset of FMT);
assume A1: (for x being (Element of FMT) holds (for V1,V2 being (Subset of FMT) holds ((V1 in ( U_FMT x ) & V2 in ( U_FMT x )) implies (ex W being (Subset of FMT) st (W in ( U_FMT x ) & W c= ( V1 /\ V2 ))))));
(for x being (Element of FMT) holds (x in ( ( A \/ B ) ^Fodelta ) implies x in ( ( A ^Fodelta ) \/ ( B ^Fodelta ) )))
proof
let x being (Element of FMT);
assume A2: x in ( ( A \/ B ) ^Fodelta );
A3: (for W1 being (Subset of FMT) holds (W1 in ( U_FMT x ) implies ((W1 meets A & W1 meets ( A ` )) or (W1 meets B & W1 meets ( B ` )))))
proof
let W1 being (Subset of FMT);
assume A4: W1 in ( U_FMT x );
then W1 meets ( ( A \/ B ) ` ) by A2,CKB30:1;
then ( W1 /\ ( ( A \/ B ) ` ) ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A5: ( W1 /\ ( ( A ` ) /\ ( B ` ) ) ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_1:53;
then ( ( W1 /\ ( A ` ) ) /\ ( B ` ) ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_1:16;
then ( W1 /\ ( A ` ) ) meets ( B ` ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A6: (ex z1 being set st z1 in ( ( W1 /\ ( A ` ) ) /\ ( B ` ) )) by XBOOLE_0:4;
( ( W1 /\ ( B ` ) ) /\ ( A ` ) ) <> ( {} ) by A5,XBOOLE_1:16;
then ( W1 /\ ( B ` ) ) meets ( A ` ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A7: (ex z2 being set st z2 in ( ( W1 /\ ( B ` ) ) /\ ( A ` ) )) by XBOOLE_0:4;
W1 meets ( A \/ B ) by A2,A4,CKB30:1;
then ( W1 /\ ( A \/ B ) ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then ( ( W1 /\ A ) \/ ( W1 /\ B ) ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_1:23;
then ((( W1 /\ A ) <> ( {} ) & ( W1 /\ ( A ` ) ) <> ( {} )) or (( W1 /\ B ) <> ( {} ) & ( W1 /\ ( B ` ) ) <> ( {} ))) by A6,A7;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 7;

(for V1,V2 being (Subset of FMT) holds ((V1 in ( U_FMT x ) & V2 in ( U_FMT x )) implies ((V1 meets A & V1 meets ( A ` )) or (V2 meets B & V2 meets ( B ` )))))
proof
let V1 being (Subset of FMT);
let V2 being (Subset of FMT);
assume (V1 in ( U_FMT x ) & V2 in ( U_FMT x ));
then consider W being (Subset of FMT) such that A8: W in ( U_FMT x ) and A9: W c= ( V1 /\ V2 ) by A1;
( V1 /\ V2 ) c= V2 by XBOOLE_1:17;
then W c= V2 by A9,XBOOLE_1:1;
then A10: (( W /\ B ) c= ( V2 /\ B ) & ( W /\ ( B ` ) ) c= ( V2 /\ ( B ` ) )) by XBOOLE_1:26;
( V1 /\ V2 ) c= V1 by XBOOLE_1:17;
then W c= V1 by A9,XBOOLE_1:1;
then A11: (( W /\ A ) c= ( V1 /\ A ) & ( W /\ ( A ` ) ) c= ( V1 /\ ( A ` ) )) by XBOOLE_1:26;
((V1 meets A & V1 meets ( A ` )) or (V2 meets B & V2 meets ( B ` )))
proof
now
per cases  by A3,A8;
case (W meets A & W meets ( A ` ));
then ((ex z1 being set st z1 in ( W /\ A )) & (ex z2 being set st z2 in ( W /\ ( A ` ) ))) by XBOOLE_0:4;
hence thesis by A11,XBOOLE_0:4;
end;
case (W meets B & W meets ( B ` ));
then ((ex z3 being set st z3 in ( W /\ B )) & (ex z4 being set st z4 in ( W /\ ( B ` ) ))) by XBOOLE_0:4;
hence thesis by A10,XBOOLE_0:4;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
then ((for V1 being (Subset of FMT) holds (V1 in ( U_FMT x ) implies (V1 meets A & V1 meets ( A ` )))) or (for V2 being (Subset of FMT) holds (V2 in ( U_FMT x ) implies (V2 meets B & V2 meets ( B ` )))));
then (x in ( A ^Fodelta ) or x in ( B ^Fodelta ));
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 3;

hence thesis by SUBSET_1:2;
