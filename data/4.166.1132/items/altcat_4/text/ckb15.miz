theorem
(((o1 is  initial & o2 is  terminal) & <^ o2,o1 ^> <> ( {} )) implies (o2 is  initial & o1 is  terminal))
proof
assume that
A1: o1 is  initial
and
A2: o2 is  terminal;
consider l being (Morphism of o1,o2) such that A3: l in <^ o1,o2 ^> and (for M1 being (Morphism of o1,o2) holds (M1 in <^ o1,o2 ^> implies l = M1)) by A1,ALTCAT_3:25;
assume <^ o2,o1 ^> <> ( {} );
then consider m being set such that A4: m in <^ o2,o1 ^> by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
reconsider m as (Morphism of o2,o1) by A4;
(for o3 being (object of C) holds (ex M being (Morphism of o2,o3) st (M in <^ o2,o3 ^> & (for M1 being (Morphism of o2,o3) holds (M1 in <^ o2,o3 ^> implies M = M1)))))
proof
let o3 being (object of C);
consider M being (Morphism of o1,o3) such that A5: M in <^ o1,o3 ^> and A6: (for M1 being (Morphism of o1,o3) holds (M1 in <^ o1,o3 ^> implies M = M1)) by A1,ALTCAT_3:25;
take ( M * m );
<^ o2,o3 ^> <> ( {} ) by A4,A5,ALTCAT_1:def 2;
hence ( M * m ) in <^ o2,o3 ^>;
let M1 being (Morphism of o2,o3);
assume that
A7: M1 in <^ o2,o3 ^>;
consider i2 being (Morphism of o2,o2) such that i2 in <^ o2,o2 ^> and A8: (for M1 being (Morphism of o2,o2) holds (M1 in <^ o2,o2 ^> implies i2 = M1)) by A2,ALTCAT_3:27;
thus ( M * m ) = ( ( M1 * l ) * m ) by A5,A6
.= ( M1 * ( l * m ) ) by A4,A3,A7,ALTCAT_1:21
.= ( M1 * i2 ) by A8
.= ( M1 * ( idm o2 ) ) by A8
.= M1 by A7,ALTCAT_1:def 17;
end;
hence o2 is  initial by ALTCAT_3:25;
(for o3 being (object of C) holds (ex M being (Morphism of o3,o1) st (M in <^ o3,o1 ^> & (for M1 being (Morphism of o3,o1) holds (M1 in <^ o3,o1 ^> implies M = M1)))))
proof
let o3 being (object of C);
consider M being (Morphism of o3,o2) such that A9: M in <^ o3,o2 ^> and A10: (for M1 being (Morphism of o3,o2) holds (M1 in <^ o3,o2 ^> implies M = M1)) by A2,ALTCAT_3:27;
take ( m * M );
<^ o3,o1 ^> <> ( {} ) by A4,A9,ALTCAT_1:def 2;
hence ( m * M ) in <^ o3,o1 ^>;
let M1 being (Morphism of o3,o1);
assume that
A11: M1 in <^ o3,o1 ^>;
consider i1 being (Morphism of o1,o1) such that i1 in <^ o1,o1 ^> and A12: (for M1 being (Morphism of o1,o1) holds (M1 in <^ o1,o1 ^> implies i1 = M1)) by A1,ALTCAT_3:25;
thus ( m * M ) = ( m * ( l * M1 ) ) by A9,A10
.= ( ( m * l ) * M1 ) by A4,A3,A11,ALTCAT_1:21
.= ( i1 * M1 ) by A12
.= ( ( idm o1 ) * M1 ) by A12
.= M1 by A11,ALTCAT_1:20;
end;
hence thesis by ALTCAT_3:27;
