theorem
Th10: (for T being  up-complete  Scott non empty TopPoset holds T is  order_consistent)
proof
let T being  up-complete  Scott non empty TopPoset;
(for x being (Element of T) holds (( downarrow x ) = ( Cl { x } ) & (for N being  eventually-directed (net of T) holds (x = ( sup N ) implies (for V being (a_neighborhood of x) holds N is_eventually_in V)))))
proof
let x being (Element of T);
(for N being  eventually-directed (net of T) holds (x = ( sup N ) implies (for V being (a_neighborhood of x) holds N is_eventually_in V)))
proof
let N being  eventually-directed (net of T);
assume x = ( sup N );
then x = ( Sup (the mapping of N) ) by WAYBEL_2:def 1;
then A1: x = ( sup ( rng (the mapping of N) ) ) by YELLOW_2:def 5;
let V being (a_neighborhood of x);
A2: x in ( Int V ) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
reconsider rngN = ( rng ( netmap (N,T) ) ) as (Subset of T);
rngN is  directed by WAYBEL_2:18;
then ( Int V ) meets rngN by A1,A2,WAYBEL11:def 1;
then consider z being set such that A4: z in ( Int V ) and A5: z in rngN by XBOOLE_0:3;
reconsider z9 = z as (Element of T) by A4;
consider i being set such that A6: i in ( dom (the mapping of N) ) and A7: z9 = ( (the mapping of N) . i ) by A5,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider i as (Element of N) by A6;
consider j being (Element of N) such that A8: (for k being (Element of N) holds (j <= k implies ( N . i ) <= ( N . k ))) by WAYBEL_0:11;
take j;
let l being (Element of N);
assume j <= l;
then ( N . i ) <= ( N . l ) by A8;
then A9: ( N . l ) in ( Int V ) by A4,A7,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
( Int V ) c= V by TOPS_1:16;
hence thesis by A9;
end;
hence thesis by CKB12:1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB3:def 1;
