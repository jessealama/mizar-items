theorem
Th1: (for T being  upper  up-complete non  empty TopPoset holds (for A being (Subset of T) holds (A is  open implies A is  upper)))
proof
let T being  upper  up-complete non  empty TopPoset;
let A being (Subset of T);
assume A is  open;
then A1: A in (the topology of T) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
reconsider BB = { ( ( downarrow x ) ` ) where x is (Element of T): (not contradiction) } as (prebasis of T) by CKB1:def 1;
consider F being (Basis of T) such that A2: F c= ( FinMeetCl BB ) by CANTOR_1:def 4;
(the topology of T) c= ( UniCl F ) by CANTOR_1:def 2;
then consider Y being (Subset-Family of T) such that A3: Y c= F and A4: A = ( union Y ) by A1,CANTOR_1:def 1;
let x being (Element of T);
let y being (Element of T);
assume x in A;
then consider Z being set such that A5: x in Z and A6: Z in Y by A4,TARSKI:def 4;
Z in F by A3,A6;
then consider X being (Subset-Family of T) such that A7: X c= BB and X is  finite and A8: Z = ( Intersect X ) by A2,CANTOR_1:def 3;
assume A9: x <= y;
now
let Q being set;
assume A10: Q in X;
then Q in BB by A7;
then consider z being (Element of T) such that A11: Q = ( ( downarrow z ) ` );
A12: x in Q by A5,A8,A10,SETFAM_1:43;
( downarrow z ) misses Q by A11,XBOOLE_1:79;
then (not x in ( downarrow z )) by A12,XBOOLE_0:3;
then (not x <= z) by WAYBEL_0:17;
then (not y <= z) by A9,ORDERS_2:3;
then (not y in ( downarrow z )) by WAYBEL_0:17;
hence y in Q by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
then y in Z by A8,SETFAM_1:43;
hence thesis by A4,A6,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
