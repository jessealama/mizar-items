theorem
(for T being  up-complete non empty TopPoset holds (T is  upper implies T is  order_consistent))
proof
let T being  up-complete non empty TopPoset;
assume A1: T is  upper;
then reconsider BB = { ( ( downarrow x ) ` ) where x is (Element of T): (not contradiction) } as (prebasis of T) by CKB1:def 1;
(for x being (Element of T) holds (( downarrow x ) = ( Cl { x } ) & (for N being  eventually-directed (net of T) holds (x = ( sup N ) implies (for V being (a_neighborhood of x) holds N is_eventually_in V)))))
proof
let x being (Element of T);
A2: ( downarrow x ) c= ( Cl { x } )
proof
let a being set;
assume A3: a in ( downarrow x );
then reconsider a9 = a as (Point of T);
(for G being (Subset of T) holds (G is  open implies (a9 in G implies { x } meets G)))
proof
let G being (Subset of T);
assume that
A4: G is  open;
assume A5: a9 in G;
reconsider v = a9 as (Element of T);
A6: v <= x by A3,WAYBEL_0:17;
G is  upper by A1,A4,CKB6:1;
then A7: x in G by A5,A6,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
x in { x } by TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A7,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
hence thesis by PRE_TOPC:24;
end;
( Cl { x } ) c= ( downarrow x )
proof
let a being set;
assume A8: a in ( Cl { x } );
reconsider BB as (Subset-Family of T);
( ( downarrow x ) ` ) in BB;
then A9: ( ( downarrow x ) ` ) is  open by TOPS_2:def 1;
( ( downarrow x ) ` ) = ( ( [#] T ) \ ( downarrow x ) );
then A10: ( downarrow x ) is  closed by A9,PRE_TOPC:def 3;
x <= x;
then x in ( downarrow x ) by WAYBEL_0:17;
then { x } c= ( downarrow x ) by ZFMISC_1:31;
hence thesis by A8,A10,PRE_TOPC:15;
end;
hence ( downarrow x ) = ( Cl { x } ) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
thus (for N being  eventually-directed (net of T) holds (x = ( sup N ) implies (for V being (a_neighborhood of x) holds N is_eventually_in V)))
proof
let N being  eventually-directed (net of T);
assume x = ( sup N );
then A11: x = ( Sup (the mapping of N) ) by WAYBEL_2:def 1
.= ( sup ( rng ( netmap (N,T) ) ) ) by YELLOW_2:def 5;
let V being (a_neighborhood of x);
A12: x in ( Int V ) by CONNSP_2:def 1;
( FinMeetCl BB ) is (Basis of T) by YELLOW_9:23;
then A13: (the topology of T) = ( UniCl ( FinMeetCl BB ) ) by YELLOW_9:22;
( Int V ) in (the topology of T) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then consider Y being (Subset-Family of T) such that A14: Y c= ( FinMeetCl BB ) and A15: ( Int V ) = ( union Y ) by A13,CANTOR_1:def 1;
consider Y1 being set such that A16: x in Y1 and A17: Y1 in Y by A12,A15,TARSKI:def 4;
consider Z being (Subset-Family of T) such that A18: Z c= BB and A19: Z is  finite and A20: Y1 = ( Intersect Z ) by A14,A17,CANTOR_1:def 3;
reconsider rngN = ( rng ( netmap (N,T) ) ) as (Subset of T);
rngN is  directed by WAYBEL_2:18;
then (ex a being (Element of T) st (a is_>=_than rngN & (for b being (Element of T) holds (b is_>=_than rngN implies a <= b)))) by WAYBEL_0:def 39;
then A21:  ex_sup_of rngN,T by YELLOW_0:15;
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(for i,j being (Element of N) holds ((i = $2 & j >= i) implies ( N . j ) in $1));
A22: (for Q being set holds (Q in Z implies (ex b being set st (b in (the carrier of N) & P[ Q,b ]))))
proof
let Q being set;
assume A23: Q in Z;
then Q in BB by A18;
then consider v1 being (Element of T) such that A24: Q = ( ( downarrow v1 ) ` );
x in ( ( downarrow v1 ) ` ) by A16,A20,A23,A24,SETFAM_1:43;
then (not x in ( downarrow v1 )) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then A25: (not x <= v1) by WAYBEL_0:17;
(not rngN c= ( downarrow v1 ))
proof
assume A26: rngN c= ( downarrow v1 );
 ex_sup_of ( downarrow v1 ),T by WAYBEL_0:34;
then ( sup rngN ) <= ( sup ( downarrow v1 ) ) by A21,A26,YELLOW_0:34;
hence contradiction by A11,A25,WAYBEL_0:34;
end;
then consider w being set such that A27: w in rngN and A28: (not w in ( downarrow v1 )) by TARSKI:def 3;
reconsider w9 = w as (Element of T) by A27;
consider i being set such that A29: i in ( dom (the mapping of N) ) and A30: w9 = ( (the mapping of N) . i ) by A27,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider i as (Element of N) by A29;
consider b being (Element of N) such that A31: (for l being (Element of N) holds (b <= l implies ( N . i ) <= ( N . l ))) by WAYBEL_0:11;
take b;
thus b in (the carrier of N);
thus (for j,k being (Element of N) holds ((j = b & k >= j) implies ( N . k ) in Q))
proof
let j being (Element of N),k being (Element of N);
assume that
A32: j = b
and
A33: k >= j;
A34: ( N . i ) <= ( N . k ) by A31,A32,A33;
(not ( N . i ) <= v1) by A28,A30,WAYBEL_0:17;
then (not ( N . k ) <= v1) by A34,ORDERS_2:3;
then (not ( N . k ) in ( downarrow v1 )) by WAYBEL_0:17;
hence thesis by A24,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;

end;
consider f being Function such that A35: (( dom f ) = Z & ( rng f ) c= (the carrier of N)) and A36: (for Q being set holds (Q in Z implies P[ Q,( f . Q ) ])) from FUNCT_1:sch 5(A22);
reconsider rngf = ( rng f ) as  finite (Subset of ( [#] N )) by A19,A35,FINSET_1:8;
( [#] N ) is  directed by WAYBEL_0:def 6;
then consider k being (Element of N) such that k in ( [#] N ) and A37: k is_>=_than rngf by WAYBEL_0:1;
take k;
let k1 being (Element of N);
assume that
A38: k <= k1;
now
let Q being set;
assume A39: Q in Z;
then A40: ( f . Q ) in rngf by A35,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then reconsider j = ( f . Q ) as (Element of N);
j <= k by A37,A40,LATTICE3:def 9;
hence ( N . k1 ) in Q by A36,A38,A39,ORDERS_2:3;
end;
then A41: ( N . k1 ) in Y1 by A20,SETFAM_1:43;
Y1 c= ( union Y ) by A17,ZFMISC_1:74;
then A42: ( N . k1 ) in ( Int V ) by A15,A41;
( Int V ) c= V by TOPS_1:16;
hence thesis by A42;

hence thesis by CKB3:def 1;
