theorem
Th11: (for R being  /\-complete Semilattice holds (for Z being (net of R) holds (for D being (Subset of R) holds (D = { ( "/\" ({ ( Z . k ) where k is (Element of Z): k >= j },R) ) where j is (Element of Z): (not contradiction) } implies D is non  empty  directed))))
proof
let R being  /\-complete Semilattice;
let Z being (net of R);
let D being (Subset of R);
assume A1: D = { ( "/\" ({ ( Z . k ) where k is (Element of Z): k >= j },R) ) where j is (Element of Z): (not contradiction) };
set j = the (Element of Z);
( "/\" ({ ( Z . k ) where k is (Element of Z): k >= j },R) ) in D by A1;
hence D is non  empty;
let x being (Element of R);
let y being (Element of R);
assume x in D;
then consider jx being (Element of Z) such that A2: x = ( "/\" ({ ( Z . k ) where k is (Element of Z): k >= jx },R) ) by A1;
assume y in D;
then consider jy being (Element of Z) such that A3: y = ( "/\" ({ ( Z . k ) where k is (Element of Z): k >= jy },R) ) by A1;
reconsider jx,jy as (Element of Z);
consider j being (Element of Z) such that A4: j >= jx and A5: j >= jy by YELLOW_6:def 3;
consider j9 being (Element of Z) such that A6: j9 >= j and j9 >= j by YELLOW_6:def 3;
deffunc F((Element of Z)) = ( Z . $1 );
defpred Px[ (Element of Z) ]
 means
$1 >= jx;
defpred Py[ (Element of Z) ]
 means
$1 >= jy;
defpred P[ (Element of Z) ]
 means
$1 >= j;
set Ex = { F(k) where k is (Element of Z): Px[ k ] };
set Ey = { F(k) where k is (Element of Z): Py[ k ] };
set E = { F(k) where k is (Element of Z): P[ k ] };
A7: ( Z . j ) in Ex by A4;
A8: ( Z . j ) in Ey by A5;
A9: ( Z . j9 ) in E by A6;
A10: Ex is (Subset of R) from DOMAIN_1:sch 8;
A11: Ey is (Subset of R) from DOMAIN_1:sch 8;
A12: E is (Subset of R) from DOMAIN_1:sch 8;
take z = ( "/\" ({ ( Z . k ) where k is (Element of Z): k >= j },R) );
reconsider Ex9 = Ex as non  empty (Subset of R) by A7,A10;
reconsider Ey9 = Ey as non  empty (Subset of R) by A8,A11;
reconsider E9 = E as non  empty (Subset of R) by A9,A12;
A13:  ex_inf_of E9,R by WAYBEL_0:76;
A14:  ex_inf_of Ex9,R by WAYBEL_0:76;
A15:  ex_inf_of Ey9,R by WAYBEL_0:76;
thus z in D by A1;
E9 c= Ex9
proof
let e being set;
assume e in E9;
then consider k being (Element of Z) such that A16: e = ( Z . k ) and A17: k >= j;
reconsider k as (Element of Z);
k >= jx by A4,A17,YELLOW_0:def 2;
hence thesis by A16;
end;
hence x <= z by A2,A13,A14,YELLOW_0:35;
E9 c= Ey9
proof
let e being set;
assume e in E9;
then consider k being (Element of Z) such that A18: e = ( Z . k ) and A19: k >= j;
reconsider k as (Element of Z);
k >= jy by A5,A19,YELLOW_0:def 2;
hence thesis by A18;
end;
hence y <= z by A3,A13,A15,YELLOW_0:35;
end;
