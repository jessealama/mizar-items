theorem
(for R being  order_consistent  up-complete  /\-complete non empty TopLattice holds (for N being  eventually-directed (net of R) holds (for x being (Element of R) holds (x <= ( lim_inf N ) iff x is_a_cluster_point_of N))))
proof
let R being  order_consistent  up-complete  /\-complete non empty TopLattice;
let N being  eventually-directed (net of R);
let x being (Element of R);
thus (x <= ( lim_inf N ) implies x is_a_cluster_point_of N) by CKB48:1;
thus (x is_a_cluster_point_of N implies x <= ( lim_inf N ))
proof
assume A1: x is_a_cluster_point_of N;
defpred P[ (Element of N) ]
 means
(not contradiction);
deffunc F((Element of N)) = ( "/\" ({ ( N . i ) where i is (Element of N): i >= $1 },R) );
set X = { F(j) where j is (Element of N): P[ j ] };
X is (Subset of R) from DOMAIN_1:sch 8;
then reconsider D = X as (Subset of R);
reconsider D as non empty  directed (Subset of R) by CKB14:1;
(for G being (Subset of R) holds (G is  open implies (x in G implies { ( sup D ) } meets G)))
proof
let G being (Subset of R);
assume that
A2: G is  open;
assume x in G;
then reconsider G as (a_neighborhood of x) by A2,CONNSP_2:3;
A3: N is_often_in G by A1,WAYBEL_9:def 9;
now
let i being (Element of N);
consider j1 being (Element of N) such that i <= j1 and A4: ( N . j1 ) in G by A3,WAYBEL_0:def 12;
consider j2 being (Element of N) such that A5: (for k being (Element of N) holds (j2 <= k implies ( N . j1 ) <= ( N . k ))) by WAYBEL_0:11;
defpred P[ (Element of N) ]
 means
$1 >= j2;
deffunc F((Element of N)) = ( N . $1 );
set E = { F(k) where k is (Element of N): P[ k ] };
A6: E is (Subset of R) from DOMAIN_1:sch 8;
consider j9 being (Element of N) such that A7: j9 >= j2 and j9 >= j2 by YELLOW_6:def 3;
( N . j9 ) in E by A7;
then reconsider E9 = E as non empty (Subset of R) by A6;
A8:  ex_inf_of E9,R by WAYBEL_0:76;
( N . j1 ) is_<=_than E9
proof
let b being (Element of R);
assume b in E9;
then (ex k being (Element of N) st (b = ( N . k ) & k >= j2));
hence ( N . j1 ) <= b by A5;
end;
then A9: ( N . j1 ) <= ( "/\" (E9,R) ) by A8,YELLOW_0:31;
(for a being (Element of R) holds ( downarrow a ) = ( Cl { a } )) by CKB3:def 1;
then A10: G is  upper by A2,CKB33:1;
then A11: ( "/\" (E9,R) ) in G by A4,A9,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
( "/\" (E9,R) ) in D;
then ( "/\" (E9,R) ) <= ( sup D ) by CKB26:1;
hence ( sup D ) in G by A10,A11,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
end;
then A12: ( sup D ) in G;
( sup D ) in { ( sup D ) } by TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A12,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;
then x in ( Cl { ( sup D ) } ) by PRE_TOPC:24;
then x in ( downarrow ( sup D ) ) by CKB3:def 1;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:17;
end;
