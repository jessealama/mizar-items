theorem
(for S being  up-complete  /\-complete Semilattice holds (for T being  Scott (TopAugmentation of S) holds ( sigma S ) = (the topology of T)))
proof
let S being  up-complete  /\-complete Semilattice;
let T being  Scott (TopAugmentation of S);
thus ( sigma S ) c= (the topology of T)
proof
let e being set;
assume A1: e in ( sigma S );
then reconsider A = e as (Subset of S);
A2: ( the RelStr of S ) = ( the RelStr of T ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
then reconsider A9 = A as (Subset of T);
A is  inaccessible  upper by A1,CKB17:1;
then A9 is  inaccessible  upper by A2,WAYBEL_0:25,YELLOW_9:47;
hence thesis by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
end;

let e being set;
assume A3: e in (the topology of T);
then reconsider A = e as (Subset of T);
A4: A is  open by A3,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
A5: ( the RelStr of S ) = ( the RelStr of T ) by YELLOW_9:def 4;
then reconsider A9 = A as (Subset of S);
A9 is  inaccessible
proof
let D being non empty  directed (Subset of S);
assume that
A6: ( sup D ) in A9;
reconsider E = D as (Subset of T) by A5;
(ex a being (Element of S) st (a is_>=_than D & (for b being (Element of S) holds (b is_>=_than D implies a <= b)))) by WAYBEL_0:def 39;
then A7:  ex_sup_of D,S by YELLOW_0:15;
A8: E is  directed by A5,WAYBEL_0:3;
( sup D ) = ( sup E ) by A5,A7,YELLOW_0:26;
hence thesis by A4,A6,A8,WAYBEL11:def 1;
end;
then A9 is  inaccessible  upper by A4,A5,WAYBEL_0:25;
hence thesis by CKB17:1;
