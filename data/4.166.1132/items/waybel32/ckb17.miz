theorem
Th14: (for R being  /\-complete Semilattice holds (for S being (Subset of R) holds (S in (the topology of ( ConvergenceSpace ( Scott-Convergence R ) )) iff S is  inaccessible  upper)))
proof
let R being  /\-complete Semilattice;
set SC = ( Scott-Convergence R );
set T = ( ConvergenceSpace SC );
A1: (the topology of T) = { V where V is (Subset of R): (for p being (Element of R) holds (p in V implies (for N being (net of R) holds ([ N,p ] in SC implies N is_eventually_in V)))) } by YELLOW_6:def 24;
let S being (Subset of R);
hereby
assume S in (the topology of T);
then A2: (ex V being (Subset of R) st (S = V & (for p being (Element of R) holds (p in V implies (for N being (net of R) holds ([ N,p ] in SC implies N is_eventually_in V)))))) by A1;
thus S is  inaccessible
proof
let D being non empty  directed (Subset of R);
assume that
A3: ( sup D ) in S;
A4: ( dom ( id D ) ) = D by RELAT_1:45;
A5: ( rng ( id D ) ) = D by RELAT_1:45;

then ( sup D ) is_S-limit_of N by WAYBEL11:def 7;
then [ N,( sup D ) ] in SC by A6,WAYBEL11:def 8;
then N is_eventually_in S by A2,A3;
then consider i0 being (Element of N) such that A7: (for j being (Element of N) holds (i0 <= j implies ( N . j ) in S)) by WAYBEL_0:def 11;

thus S is  upper

then [ ( Net-Str y ),x ] in SC by A13,WAYBEL11:def 8;
then ( Net-Str y ) is_eventually_in S by A2,A11;
