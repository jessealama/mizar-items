proof
set l1 = ( linfty_Space );
A1: ( 0. l1 ) = ( 0. ( Linear_Space_of_RealSequences ) ) by RSSPACE:def 10
.= ( Zeroseq ) by RSSPACE:def 7;
A2: (for x being set holds (x is (Element of l1) iff (x is Real_Sequence & ( seq_id x ) is  bounded)))
proof
let x being set;
(x in ( the_set_of_RealSequences ) iff x is Real_Sequence) by RSSPACE:def 1;
hence thesis by CKB3:def 1;
end;
A3: (for u,v being (VECTOR of l1) holds ( u + v ) = ( ( seq_id u ) + ( seq_id v ) ))
proof
let u being (VECTOR of l1),v being (VECTOR of l1);
reconsider u1 = u,v1 = v as (VECTOR of ( Linear_Space_of_RealSequences )) by CKB6:1,RLSUB_1:10;
set L1 = ( Linear_Space_of_RealSequences );
set W = ( the_set_of_BoundedRealSequences );
( dom (the addF of L1) ) = [: (the carrier of L1),(the carrier of L1) :] by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A4: ( dom ( (the addF of ( Linear_Space_of_RealSequences )) || W ) ) = [: W,W :] by RELAT_1:62;
( u + v ) = ( ( (the addF of ( Linear_Space_of_RealSequences )) || W ) . [ u,v ] ) by RSSPACE:def 8
.= ( u1 + v1 ) by A4,FUNCT_1:47;
hence thesis by RSSPACE:2,RSSPACE:def 7;
end;
A5: (for r being Real holds (for u being (VECTOR of l1) holds ( r * u ) = ( r (#) ( seq_id u ) )))
proof
let r being Real;
let u being (VECTOR of l1);
reconsider u1 = u as (VECTOR of ( Linear_Space_of_RealSequences )) by CKB6:1,RLSUB_1:10;
set L1 = ( Linear_Space_of_RealSequences );
set W = ( the_set_of_BoundedRealSequences );
( dom (the Mult of L1) ) = [: ( REAL ),(the carrier of L1) :] by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A6: ( dom ( (the Mult of ( Linear_Space_of_RealSequences )) | [: ( REAL ),W :] ) ) = [: ( REAL ),W :] by RELAT_1:62,ZFMISC_1:96;
( r * u ) = ( ( (the Mult of ( Linear_Space_of_RealSequences )) | [: ( REAL ),W :] ) . [ r,u ] ) by RSSPACE:def 9
.= ( r * u1 ) by A6,FUNCT_1:47;
hence thesis by RSSPACE:3,RSSPACE:def 7;
end;
A7: (for u being (VECTOR of l1) holds u = ( seq_id u ))
proof
let u being (VECTOR of l1);
u is (VECTOR of ( Linear_Space_of_RealSequences )) by CKB6:1,RLSUB_1:10;
hence thesis by RSSPACE:def 2,RSSPACE:def 7;
end;
A8: (for u being (VECTOR of l1) holds (( - u ) = ( - ( seq_id u ) ) & ( seq_id ( - u ) ) = ( - ( seq_id u ) )))
proof
let u being (VECTOR of l1);
( - u ) = ( ( - 1 ) * u ) by RLVECT_1:16
.= ( - ( seq_id u ) ) by A5;
hence thesis by A7;
end;
(for u,v being (VECTOR of l1) holds ( u - v ) = ( ( seq_id u ) - ( seq_id v ) ))
proof
let u being (VECTOR of l1),v being (VECTOR of l1);
thus ( u - v ) = ( ( seq_id u ) + ( seq_id ( - v ) ) ) by A3
.= ( ( seq_id u ) - ( seq_id v ) ) by A8;
end;
hence thesis by A2,A7,A3,A5,A8,A1,CKB9:def 1;
