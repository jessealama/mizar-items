[: X,( product <* Y *> ) :] )) & (for v being (Point of [: X,Y :]) holds ||. ( I . v ) .|| = ||. v .||))))
proof
let X being non empty RealNormSpace,Y being non empty RealNormSpace;
consider J being (Function of Y,( product <* Y *> )) such that A1: ((((((J is  one-to-one & J is  onto) & (for y being (Point of Y) holds ( J . y ) = <* y *>)) & (for v,w being (Point of Y) holds ( J .

defpred P[ set,set,set ]
 means
$3 = [ $1,<* $2 *> ];
A2: (for x,y being set holds ((x in (the carrier of X) & y in (the carrier of Y)) implies (ex z being set st (z in (the carrier of [: X,( product <* Y *> ) :]) & P[ x,y,z ]))))
proof
let x being set,y being set;
assume A3: (x in (the carrier of X) & y in (the carrier of Y));
then reconsider y0 = y as (Point of Y);
( J . y0 ) = <* y0 *> by A1;
then [ x,<* y *> ] in [: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of ( product <* Y *> )) :] by A3,ZFMISC_1:87;
hence thesis;
end;
consider I being (Function of [: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of Y) :],(the carrier of [: X,( product <* Y *> ) :])) such that A4: (for x,y being set holds ((x in (the carrier of X) & y in (the carrier of Y)) implies P[ x,y,( I . (x,y) ) ])) from BINOP_1:sch 1(A2);
reconsider I as (Function of [: X,Y :],[: X,( product <* Y *> ) :]);
take I;
thus I is  one-to-one
proof
now
let z1 being set,z2 being set;
assume A5: ((z1 in (the carrier of [: X,Y :]) & z2 in (the carrier of [: X,Y :])) & ( I . z1 ) = ( I . z2 ));
then consider x1 being set,y1 being set such that A6: ((x1 in (the carrier of X) & y1 in (the carrier of Y)) & z1 = [ x1,y1 ]) by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
consider x2 being set,y2 being set such that A7: ((x2 in (the carrier of X) & y2 in (the carrier of Y)) & z2 = [ x2,y2 ]) by A5,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
A8: [ x1,<* y1 *> ] = ( I . (x1,y1) ) by A4,A6
.= ( I . (x2,y2) ) by A5,A6,A7
.= [ x2,<* y2 *> ] by A4,A7;
then <* y1 *> = <* y2 *> by ZFMISC_1:27;
then y1 = y2 by FINSEQ_1:76;
hence z1 = z2 by A6,A7,A8,ZFMISC_1:27;
end;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:19;
end;

thus I is  onto
proof
now
let w being set;
assume w in (the carrier of [: X,( product <* Y *> ) :]);
then consider x being set,y1 being set such that A9: ((x in (the carrier of X) & y1 in (the carrier of ( product <* Y *> ))) & w = [ x,y1 ]) by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
y1 in ( rng J ) by A1,A9,FUNCT_2:def 3;

hence thesis by FUNCT_2:def 3;

thus (for x being (Point of X) holds (for y being (Point of Y) holds ( I . (x,y) ) = [ x,<* y *> ])) by A4;
thus (for v,w being (Point of [: X,Y :]) holds ( I . ( v + w ) ) = ( ( I . v ) + ( I . w ) ))
proof
let v being (Point of [: X,Y :]),w being (Point of [: X,Y :]);
consider x1 being (Point of X),x2 being (Point of Y) such that A12: v = [ x1,x2 ] by CKB8:1;
consider y1 being (Point of X),y2 being (Point of Y) such that A13: w = [ y1,y2 ] by CKB8:1;

A16: (( J . x2 ) = <* x2 *> & ( J . y2 ) = <* y2 *>) by A1;
then reconsider xx2 = <* x2 *> as (Point of ( product <* Y *> ));

<* ( x2 + y2 ) *> = ( J . ( x2 + y2 ) ) by A1
.= ( xx2 + yy2 ) by A16,A1;
hence ( ( I . v ) + ( I . w ) ) = ( I . ( v + w ) ) by A14,A15,CKB9:def 1;
end;

thus (for v being (Point of [: X,Y :]) holds (for r being (Element of ( REAL )) holds ( I . ( r * v ) ) = ( r * ( I . v ) )))
proof
let v being (Point of [: X,Y :]);
let r being (Element of ( REAL ));
consider x1 being (Point of X),x2 being (Point of Y) such that A17: v = [ x1,x2 ] by CKB8:1;

A20: ( J . x2 ) = <* x2 *> by A1;
then reconsider xx2 = <* x2 *> as (Point of ( product <* Y *> ));
<* ( r * x2 ) *> = ( J . ( r * x2 ) ) by A1

hence ( r * ( I . v ) ) = ( I . ( r * v ) ) by A18,A19,CKB50:1;

A21: <* ( 0. Y ) *> = ( 0. ( product <* Y *> ) ) by A1;
( I . ( 0. [: X,Y :] ) ) = ( I . (( 0. X ),( 0. Y )) );
hence ( I . ( 0. [: X,Y :] ) ) = ( 0. [: X,( product <* Y *> ) :] ) by A21,A4;
thus (for v being (Point of [: X,Y :]) holds ||. ( I . v ) .|| = ||. v .||)
proof
let v being (Point of [: X,Y :]);
consider x1 being (Point of X),x2 being (Point of Y) such that A22: v = [ x1,x2 ] by CKB8:1;
A23: ( J . x2 ) = <* x2 *> by A1;
