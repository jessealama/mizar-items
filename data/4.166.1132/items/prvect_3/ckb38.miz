( product <* G,F *> ) ) = <* ( 0. G ),( 0. F ) *>) & (for x being (Point of ( product <* G,F *> )) holds (for x1 being (Point of G) holds (for x2 being (Point of F) holds (x = <* x1,x2 *> implies ( - x ) = <* ( - x1 ),( - x2 ) *>))))) & (for x being (Point of ( product <* G,F *> )) holds (for x1 being (Point of G) holds (for x2 being (Point of F) holds (for a being  real number holds (x = <* x1,x2 *> implies ( a * x ) = <* ( a * x1 ),( a * x2 ) *>)))))))
proof
let G being RealLinearSpace,F being RealLinearSpace;
consider I being (Function of [: G,F :],( product <* G,F *> )) such that A1: (((((I is  one-to-one & I is  onto) & (for x being (Point of G) holds (for y being (Point of F) holds ( I . (x,y) ) = <* x,y *>))) & (for v,w being (Point of [: G,F :]) holds ( I . ( v + w ) ) = ( ( I . v ) + ( I . w ) ))) & (for v being (Point of [: G,F :]) holds (for r being (Element of ( REAL )) holds ( I . ( r * v ) ) = ( r * ( I . v ) )))) & ( 0. ( product <* G,F *> ) ) = ( I . ( 0. [: G,F :] ) )) by CKB35:1;
thus A2: (for x being set holds (x is (Point of ( product <* G,F *> )) iff (ex x1 being (Point of G) st (ex x2 being (Point of F) st x = <* x1,x2 *>))))
proof
let y being set;
hereby
assume y is (Point of ( product <* G,F *> ));
then y in (the carrier of ( product <* G,F *> ));
then y in ( rng I ) by A1,FUNCT_2:def 3;
then consider x being (Element of (the carrier of [: G,F :])) such that A3: y = ( I . x ) by FUNCT_2:113;
consider x1 being (Point of G),x2 being (Point of F) such that A4: x = [ x1,x2 ] by CKB8:1;
take x1;
take x2;
( I . (x1,x2) ) = <* x1,x2 *> by A1;
hence y = <* x1,x2 *> by A3,A4;
end;
now
assume (ex x1 being (Point of G) st (ex x2 being (Point of F) st y = <* x1,x2 *>));
then consider x1 being (Point of G),x2 being (Point of F) such that A5: y = <* x1,x2 *>;
A6: ( I . [ x1,x2 ] ) in ( rng I ) by FUNCT_2:112;
( I . (x1,x2) ) = <* x1,x2 *> by A1;
hence y is (Point of ( product <* G,F *> )) by A5,A6;
end;
hence thesis;
end;

thus A7: (for x,y being (Point of ( product <* G,F *> )) holds (for x1,y1 being (Point of G) holds (for x2,y2 being (Point of F) holds ((x = <* x1,x2 *> & y = <* y1,y2 *>) implies ( x + y ) = <* ( x1 + y1 ),( x2 + y2 ) *>))))
proof
let x being (Point of ( product <* G,F *> )),y being (Point of ( product <* G,F *> ));
let x1 being (Point of G),y1 being (Point of G);
let x2 being (Point of F),y2 being (Point of F);
assume A8: (x = <* x1,x2 *> & y = <* y1,y2 *>);
reconsider z = [ x1,x2 ],w = [ y1,y2 ] as (Point of [: G,F :]);
A9: ( z + w ) = [ ( x1 + y1 ),( x2 + y2 ) ] by CKB9:def 1;
((( I . (( x1 + y1 ),( x2 + y2 )) ) = <* ( x1 + y1 ),( x2 + y2 ) *> & ( I . (x1,x2) ) = <* x1,x2 *>) & ( I . (y1,y2) ) = <* y1,y2 *>) by A1;
hence <* ( x1 + y1 ),( x2 + y2 ) *> = ( x + y ) by A1,A9,A8;
end;

thus A10: ( 0. ( product <* G,F *> ) ) = <* ( 0. G ),( 0. F ) *>
proof
( I . (( 0. G ),( 0. F )) ) = <* ( 0. G ),( 0. F ) *> by A1;
hence thesis by A1;
end;

thus (for x being (Point of ( product <* G,F *> )) holds (for x1 being (Point of G) holds (for x2 being (Point of F) holds (x = <* x1,x2 *> implies ( - x ) = <* ( - x1 ),( - x2 ) *>))))
proof
let x being (Point of ( product <* G,F *> ));
let x1 being (Point of G);
let x2 being (Point of F);
assume A11: x = <* x1,x2 *>;
reconsider y = <* ( - x1 ),( - x2 ) *> as (Point of ( product <* G,F *> )) by A2;
( x + y ) = <* ( x1 + ( - x1 ) ),( x2 + ( - x2 ) ) *> by A7,A11
.= <* ( 0. G ),( x2 + ( - x2 ) ) *> by RLVECT_1:def 10
.= ( 0. ( product <* G,F *> ) ) by A10,RLVECT_1:def 10;
hence thesis by RLVECT_1:def 10;
end;

thus (for x being (Point of ( product <* G,F *> )) holds (for x1 being (Point of G) holds (for x2 being (Point of F) holds (for a being  real number holds (x = <* x1,x2 *> implies ( a * x ) = <* ( a * x1 ),( a * x2 ) *>)))))
proof
let x being (Point of ( product <* G,F *> ));
let x1 being (Point of G);
let x2 being (Point of F);
let a being  real number;
assume A12: x = <* x1,x2 *>;
reconsider a0 = a as (Element of ( REAL )) by XREAL_0:def 1;
reconsider y = [ x1,x2 ] as (Point of [: G,F :]);
A13: <* x1,x2 *> = ( I . (x1,x2) ) by A1;
( I . ( a * y ) ) = ( I . (( a0 * x1 ),( a0 * x2 )) ) by CKB25:1
.= <* ( a0 * x1 ),( a0 * x2 ) *> by A1;
hence thesis by A1,A12,A13;
