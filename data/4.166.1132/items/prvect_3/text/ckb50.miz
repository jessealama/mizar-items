theorem
Th18: (for G,F being RealNormSpace holds ((((((for x being set holds (x is (Point of [: G,F :]) iff (ex x1 being (Point of G) st (ex x2 being (Point of F) st x = [ x1,x2 ])))) & (for x,y being (Point of [: G,F :]) holds (for x1,y1 being (Point of G) holds (for x2,y2 being (Point of F) holds ((x = [ x1,x2 ] & y = [ y1,y2 ]) implies ( x + y ) = [ ( x1 + y1 ),( x2 + y2 ) ]))))) & ( 0. [: G,F :] ) = [ ( 0. G ),( 0. F ) ]) & (for x being (Point of [: G,F :]) holds (for x1 being (Point of G) holds (for x2 being (Point of F) holds (x = [ x1,x2 ] implies ( - x ) = [ ( - x1 ),( - x2 ) ]))))) & (for x being (Point of [: G,F :]) holds (for x1 being (Point of G) holds (for x2 being (Point of F) holds (for a being  real number holds (x = [ x1,x2 ] implies ( a * x ) = [ ( a * x1 ),( a * x2 ) ])))))) & (for x being (Point of [: G,F :]) holds (for x1 being (Point of G) holds (for x2 being (Point of F) holds (x = [ x1,x2 ] implies (ex w being (Element of ( REAL 2 )) st (w = <* ||. x1 .||,||. x2 .|| *> & ||. x .|| = |. w .|))))))))
proof
let G being RealNormSpace,F being RealNormSpace;
thus (for x being set holds (x is (Point of [: G,F :]) iff (ex x1 being (Point of G) st (ex x2 being (Point of F) st x = [ x1,x2 ])))) by CKB8:1;
thus (for x,y being (Point of [: G,F :]) holds (for x1,y1 being (Point of G) holds (for x2,y2 being (Point of F) holds ((x = [ x1,x2 ] & y = [ y1,y2 ]) implies ( x + y ) = [ ( x1 + y1 ),( x2 + y2 ) ])))) by CKB9:def 1;
thus ( 0. [: G,F :] ) = [ ( 0. G ),( 0. F ) ];
thus (for x being (Point of [: G,F :]) holds (for x1 being (Point of G) holds (for x2 being (Point of F) holds (x = [ x1,x2 ] implies ( - x ) = [ ( - x1 ),( - x2 ) ]))))
proof
let x being (Point of [: G,F :]);
let x1 being (Point of G);
let x2 being (Point of F);
assume A1: x = [ x1,x2 ];
reconsider y = [ ( - x1 ),( - x2 ) ] as (Point of [: G,F :]);
( x + y ) = [ ( x1 + ( - x1 ) ),( x2 + ( - x2 ) ) ] by A1,CKB9:def 1
.= [ ( 0. G ),( x2 + ( - x2 ) ) ] by RLVECT_1:def 10
.= ( 0. [: G,F :] ) by RLVECT_1:def 10;
hence thesis by RLVECT_1:def 10;
end;

thus (for x being (Point of [: G,F :]) holds (for x1 being (Point of G) holds (for x2 being (Point of F) holds (for a being  real number holds (x = [ x1,x2 ] implies ( a * x ) = [ ( a * x1 ),( a * x2 ) ])))))
proof
let x being (Point of [: G,F :]);
let x1 being (Point of G);
let x2 being (Point of F);
let a being  real number;
assume A2: x = [ x1,x2 ];
reconsider a0 = a as (Element of ( REAL )) by XREAL_0:def 1;
thus ( a * x ) = ( ( prod_MLT (G,F) ) . (a0,x) )
.= [ ( a * x1 ),( a * x2 ) ] by A2,CKB10:def 1;
end;

thus (for x being (Point of [: G,F :]) holds (for x1 being (Point of G) holds (for x2 being (Point of F) holds (x = [ x1,x2 ] implies (ex w being (Element of ( REAL 2 )) st (w = <* ||. x1 .||,||. x2 .|| *> & ||. x .|| = |. w .|))))))
proof
let x being (Point of [: G,F :]);
let x1 being (Point of G);
let x2 being (Point of F);
assume A3: x = [ x1,x2 ];
(ex w being (Element of ( REAL 2 )) st (w = <* ||. x1 .||,||. x2 .|| *> & ( ( prod_NORM (G,F) ) . (x1,x2) ) = |. w .|)) by CKB39:def 1;
hence thesis by A3;
