proof
let x being set;

assume A2: (x in ( REAL ) & y in [: CarrG,CarrF :]);
then reconsider r = x as (Element of ( REAL ));
consider y1 being (Point of G),y2 being (Point of F) such that A3: y = [ y1,y2 ] by A2,CKB8:1;

now
let r being (Element of ( REAL ));
let x being (Element of [: (the carrier of G),(the carrier of F) :]);
consider x1 being (Point of G),x2 being (Point of F) such that A3: x = [ x1,x2 ] by CKB8:1;
thus ( H1 . (r,x) ) = [ ( r * x1 ),( r * x2 ) ] by A1,A3
