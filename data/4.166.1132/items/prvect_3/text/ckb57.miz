proof

consider J being (Function of [: ( product X ),( product <* Y *> ) :],( product ( X ^ <* Y *> ) )) such that A2: ((((((J is  one-to-one & J is  onto) & (for x being (Point of ( product X )) holds (for y being (Point of ( product <* Y *> )) holds (ex x1,y1 being FinSequence st ((x = x1 & y = y1) & ( J .

set K = ( J * I );
reconsider K as (Function of [: ( product X ),Y :],( product ( X ^ <* Y *> ) ));
take K;
thus K is  one-to-one by A1,A2;
A3: ( rng J ) = (the carrier of ( product ( X ^ <* Y *> ) )) by A2,FUNCT_2:def 3;
( rng I ) = (the carrier of [: ( product X ),( product <* Y *> ) :]) by A1,FUNCT_2:def 3;

.= (the carrier of ( product ( X ^ <* Y *> ) )) by A3,RELSET_1:22;
hence K is  onto by FUNCT_2:def 3;
thus (for x being (Point of ( product X )) holds (for y being (Point of Y) holds (ex x1,y1 being FinSequence st ((x = x1 & <* y *> = y1) & ( K . (x,y) ) = ( x1 ^ y1 )))))

A4: ( I . (x,y) ) = [ x,<* y *> ] by A1;
[ x,y ] in (the carrier of [: ( product X ),Y :]);
then [ x,<* y *> ] in (the carrier of [: ( product X ),( product <* Y *> ) :]) by A4,FUNCT_2:5;
then reconsider yy = <* y *> as (Point of ( product <* Y *> )) by ZFMISC_1:87;
consider x1,y1 being FinSequence such that A5: ((x = x1 & yy = y1) & ( J . (x,yy) ) = ( x1 ^ y1 )) by A2;
( J . (x,yy) ) = ( J . ( I . [ x,y ] ) ) by A4

hence thesis by A5;

thus (for v,w being (Point of [: ( product X ),Y :]) holds ( K . ( v + w ) ) = ( ( K . v ) + ( K . w ) ))
proof
let v being (Point of [: ( product X ),Y :]);
let w being (Point of [: ( product X ),Y :]);
thus ( K . ( v + w ) ) = ( J . ( I . ( v + w ) ) ) by FUNCT_2:15

end;

thus (for v being (Point of [: ( product X ),Y :]) holds (for r being (Element of ( REAL )) holds ( K . ( r * v ) ) = ( r * ( K . v ) )))
proof
let v being (Point of [: ( product X ),Y :]);
let r being (Element of ( REAL ));
thus ( K . ( r * v ) ) = ( J . ( I . ( r * v ) ) ) by FUNCT_2:15
.= ( J . ( r * ( I . v ) ) ) by A1
.= ( r * ( J . ( I . v ) ) ) by A2

end;

thus ( K . ( 0. [: ( product X ),Y :] ) ) = ( 0. ( product ( X ^ <* Y *> ) ) ) by A1,A2,FUNCT_2:15;
thus (for v being (Point of [: ( product X ),Y :]) holds ||. ( K . v ) .|| = ||. v .||)
proof
let v being (Point of [: ( product X ),Y :]);
thus ||. ( K . v ) .|| = ||. ( J . ( I . v ) ) .|| by FUNCT_2:15
