Th21: (for X,Y being non  empty RealLinearSpace holds (ex I being (Function of [: X,Y :],[: X,( product <* Y *> ) :]) st (((((I is  one-to-one & I is  onto) & (for x being (Point of X) holds (for y being (Point of Y) holds ( I .

( v + w ) ) = ( ( I . v ) + ( I . w ) ))) & (for v being (Point of [: X,Y :]) holds (for r being (Element of ( REAL )) holds ( I . ( r * v ) ) = ( r * ( I . v ) )))) & ( I . ( 0. [: X,Y :] ) ) = ( 0. [: X,( product <* Y *> ) :] ))))
proof
let X being non  empty RealLinearSpace;
let Y being non  empty RealLinearSpace;
consider J being (Function of Y,( product <* Y *> )) such that A1: (((((J is  one-to-one & J is  onto) & (for y being (Point of Y) holds ( J . y ) = <* y *>)) & (for v,w being (Point of Y) holds ( J .

defpred P[ set,set,set ]
 means
$3 = [ $1,<* $2 *> ];
A2: (for x,y being set holds ((x in (the carrier of X) & y in (the carrier of Y)) implies (ex z being set st (z in (the carrier of [: X,( product <* Y *> ) :]) & P[ x,y,z ]))))
proof
let x being set;
let y being set;
assume A3: (x in (the carrier of X) & y in (the carrier of Y));
then reconsider y0 = y as (Point of Y);
( J . y0 ) = <* y0 *> by A1;
then [ x,<* y *> ] in [: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of ( product <* Y *> )) :] by A3,ZFMISC_1:87;
hence thesis;
end;
consider I being (Function of [: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of Y) :],(the carrier of [: X,( product <* Y *> ) :])) such that A4: (for x,y being set holds ((x in (the carrier of X) & y in (the carrier of Y)) implies P[ x,y,( I . (x,y) ) ])) from BINOP_1:sch 1(A2);
reconsider I as (Function of [: X,Y :],[: X,( product <* Y *> ) :]);
take I;
now
let z1 being set;
let z2 being set;
assume A5: ((z1 in (the carrier of [: X,Y :]) & z2 in (the carrier of [: X,Y :])) & ( I . z1 ) = ( I . z2 ));
consider x1,y1 being set such that A6: ((x1 in (the carrier of X) & y1 in (the carrier of Y)) & z1 = [ x1,y1 ]) by A5,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
consider x2,y2 being set such that A7: ((x2 in (the carrier of X) & y2 in (the carrier of Y)) & z2 = [ x2,y2 ]) by A5,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
[ x1,<* y1 *> ] = ( I . (x1,y1) ) by A4,A6
.= ( I . (x2,y2) ) by A5,A6,A7
.= [ x2,<* y2 *> ] by A4,A7;
then (x1 = x2 & <* y1 *> = <* y2 *>) by ZFMISC_1:27;
hence z1 = z2 by A6,A7,FINSEQ_1:76;
end;
hence I is  one-to-one by FUNCT_2:19;
now
let w being set;
assume w in (the carrier of [: X,( product <* Y *> ) :]);
then consider x,y1 being set such that A8: ((x in (the carrier of X) & y1 in (the carrier of ( product <* Y *> ))) & w = [ x,y1 ]) by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
y1 in ( rng J ) by A1,A8,FUNCT_2:def 3;
then consider y being set such that A9: (y in (the carrier of Y) & y1 = ( J . y )) by FUNCT_2:11;
reconsider z = [ x,y ] as (Element of [: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of Y) :]) by A8,A9,ZFMISC_1:87;
( J . y ) = <* y *> by A9,A1;
then w = ( I . (x,y) ) by A4,A8,A9;
then w = ( I . z );
hence w in ( rng I ) by FUNCT_2:4;
end;
then (the carrier of [: X,( product <* Y *> ) :]) c= ( rng I ) by TARSKI:def 3;
then (the carrier of [: X,( product <* Y *> ) :]) = ( rng I ) by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence I is  onto by FUNCT_2:def 3;
thus (for x being (Point of X) holds (for y being (Point of Y) holds ( I . (x,y) ) = [ x,<* y *> ])) by A4;
thus (for v,w being (Point of [: X,Y :]) holds ( I . ( v + w ) ) = ( ( I . v ) + ( I . w ) ))
proof
let v being (Point of [: X,Y :]);
let w being (Point of [: X,Y :]);
consider x1 being (Point of X),x2 being (Point of Y) such that A10: v = [ x1,x2 ] by CKB8:1;
consider y1 being (Point of X),y2 being (Point of Y) such that A11: w = [ y1,y2 ] by CKB8:1;
A12: ( I . ( v + w ) ) = ( I . (( x1 + y1 ),( x2 + y2 )) ) by A10,A11,CKB9:def 1

(( I . v ) = ( I . (x1,x2) ) & ( I . w ) = ( I . (y1,y2) )) by A10,A11;
then A13: (( I . v ) = [ x1,<* x2 *> ] & ( I . w ) = [ y1,<* y2 *> ]) by A4;
A14: (( J . x2 ) = <* x2 *> & ( J . y2 ) = <* y2 *>) by A1;
then reconsider xx2 = <* x2 *> as (Point of ( product <* Y *> ));
reconsider yy2 = <* y2 *> as (Point of ( product <* Y *> )) by A14;
<* ( x2 + y2 ) *> = ( J . ( x2 + y2 ) ) by A1
.= ( xx2 + yy2 ) by A14,A1;
hence ( ( I . v ) + ( I . w ) ) = ( I . ( v + w ) ) by A12,A13,CKB9:def 1;
end;

thus (for v being (Point of [: X,Y :]) holds (for r being (Element of ( REAL )) holds ( I . ( r * v ) ) = ( r * ( I . v ) )))
proof
let v being (Point of [: X,Y :]);
let r being (Element of ( REAL ));
consider x1 being (Point of X),x2 being (Point of Y) such that A15: v = [ x1,x2 ] by CKB8:1;
A16: ( I . ( r * v ) ) = ( I . (( r * x1 ),( r * x2 )) ) by A15,CKB25:1
.= [ ( r * x1 ),<* ( r * x2 ) *> ] by A4;
A17: ( I . v ) = ( I . (x1,x2) ) by A15
.= [ x1,<* x2 *> ] by A4;
A18: ( J . x2 ) = <* x2 *> by A1;
then reconsider xx2 = <* x2 *> as (Point of ( product <* Y *> ));
<* ( r * x2 ) *> = ( J . ( r * x2 ) ) by A1
.= ( r * xx2 ) by A18,A1;
hence ( r * ( I . v ) ) = ( I . ( r * v ) ) by A16,A17,CKB25:1;
end;

A19: <* ( 0. Y ) *> = ( 0. ( product <* Y *> ) ) by A1;
( I . ( 0. [: X,Y :] ) ) = ( I . (( 0. X ),( 0. Y )) );
hence ( I . ( 0. [: X,Y :] ) ) = ( 0. [: X,( product <* Y *> ) :] ) by A19,A4;
end;
