theorem
Th2: (for f being non  empty (FinSequence of ( NAT )) holds (for X being set holds (( Terminals ( DTConUA (f,X) ) ) c= X & ( NonTerminals ( DTConUA (f,X) ) ) = ( dom f ))))
proof
let f being non  empty (FinSequence of ( NAT ));
let X being set;
set A = ( DTConUA (f,X) );
set D = ( ( dom f ) \/ X );
A1: (the carrier of A) = ( ( Terminals A ) \/ ( NonTerminals A ) ) by LANG1:1;
( Terminals A ) misses ( NonTerminals A ) by DTCONSTR:8;
then A2: ( ( Terminals A ) /\ ( NonTerminals A ) ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
thus ( Terminals A ) c= X
proof
let x;
assume A3: x in ( Terminals A );
then reconsider xd = x as (Element of D) by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
reconsider xa = x as (Element of (the carrier of A)) by A1,A3,XBOOLE_0:def 3;

reconsider a = ( fx |-> xd ) as (FinSequence of D);
reconsider a as (Element of ( D * )) by FINSEQ_1:def 11;
( len a ) = ( f . xd ) by CARD_1:def 7;
then [ xd,a ] in ( REL (f,X) ) by A6,CKB18:def 1;
then xa ==> a by LANG1:def 1;
then xa in { t where t is (Symbol of A): (ex n being FinSequence st t ==> n) };
then x in ( NonTerminals A ) by LANG1:def 3;
hence contradiction by A2,A3,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
x in ( ( dom f ) \/ X ) by A1,A3,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
hence thesis by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;

thus ( NonTerminals A ) c= ( dom f )
proof
let x;
assume x in ( NonTerminals A );
then x in { t where t is (Symbol of A): (ex n being FinSequence st t ==> n) } by LANG1:def 3;
then consider t being (Symbol of A) such that A7: x = t and A8: (ex n being FinSequence st t ==> n);
consider n being FinSequence such that A9: t ==> n by A8;
[ t,n ] in (the Rules of A) by A9,LANG1:def 1;
then reconsider n as (Element of ( D * )) by ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider t as (Element of D);
[ t,n ] in ( REL (f,X) ) by A9,LANG1:def 1;
hence thesis by A7,CKB18:def 1;
