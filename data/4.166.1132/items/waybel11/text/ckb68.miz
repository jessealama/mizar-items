Th31: (for L being  complete LATTICE holds (for S being (Subset of L) holds (S in (the topology of ( ConvergenceSpace ( Scott-Convergence L ) )) iff S is  inaccessible  upper)))
proof
let L being  complete LATTICE;

set T = ( ConvergenceSpace SC );
A1: (the topology of T) = { V where V is (Subset of L): (for p being (Element of L) holds (p in V implies (for N being (net of L) holds ([ N,p ] in SC implies N is_eventually_in V)))) } by YELLOW_6:def 24;
let S being (Subset of L);
hereby
assume S in (the topology of T);
then A2: (ex V being (Subset of L) st (S = V & (for p being (Element of L) holds (p in V implies (for N being (net of L) holds ([ N,p ] in SC implies N is_eventually_in V)))))) by A1;
thus S is  inaccessible

then N is_eventually_in S by A2,A3;
