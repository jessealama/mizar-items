theorem
(for T being non empty  transitive  reflexive TopRelStr holds ((the topology of T) = { S where S is (Subset of T): S is  property(S) } implies T is  TopSpace-like))
proof
let T being non empty  transitive  reflexive TopRelStr;
assume that
A1: (the topology of T) = { S where S is (Subset of T): S is  property(S) };
( [#] T ) is  property(S) by CKB40:1;
hence (the carrier of T) in (the topology of T) by A1;
hereby
let a being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A2: a c= (the topology of T);
( union a ) is  property(S)
proof
let D being non empty  directed (Subset of T);
assume ( sup D ) in ( union a );
then consider x being set such that A3: ( sup D ) in x and A4: x in a by TARSKI:def 4;
x in (the topology of T) by A2,A4;
then consider X being (Subset of T) such that A5: x = X and A6: X is  property(S) by A1;
consider y being (Element of T) such that A7: y in D and A8: (for x being (Element of T) holds ((x in D & x >= y) implies x in X)) by A3,A5,A6,CKB16:def 1;
take y;
thus y in D by A7;
let u being (Element of T);
assume that
A9: u in D
and
A10: u >= y;
u in X by A8,A9,A10;
hence thesis by A4,A5,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
hence ( union a ) in (the topology of T) by A1;
end;
let a being (Subset of T),b being (Subset of T);
assume a in (the topology of T);
then consider A being (Subset of T) such that A11: a = A and A12: A is  property(S) by A1;
assume b in (the topology of T);
then consider B being (Subset of T) such that A13: b = B and A14: B is  property(S) by A1;
( A /\ B ) is  property(S)
proof
let D being non empty  directed (Subset of T);
assume A15: ( sup D ) in ( A /\ B );
then ( sup D ) in A by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider x being (Element of T) such that A16: x in D and A17: (for z being (Element of T) holds ((z in D & z >= x) implies z in A)) by A12,CKB16:def 1;
( sup D ) in B by A15,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider y being (Element of T) such that A18: y in D and A19: (for z being (Element of T) holds ((z in D & z >= y) implies z in B)) by A14,CKB16:def 1;
consider z being (Element of T) such that A20: z in D and A21: x <= z and A22: y <= z by A16,A18,WAYBEL_0:def 1;
take z;
thus z in D by A20;
let u being (Element of T);
assume that
A23: u in D;
assume A24: u >= z;
then u >= x by A21,YELLOW_0:def 2;
then A25: u in A by A17,A23;
u >= y by A22,A24,YELLOW_0:def 2;
then u in B by A19,A23;
hence thesis by A25,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
hence thesis by A1,A11,A13;
end;
