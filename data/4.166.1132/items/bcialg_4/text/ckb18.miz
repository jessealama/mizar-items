proof

proof
thus G is  Abelian
proof
let a being (Element of G),b being (Element of G);

uniqueness
proof
thus (for G1,G2 being  strict AbGroup holds (((((((the carrier of G1) = (the carrier of X) & (for x,y being (Element of X) holds ( (the addF of G1) . (x,y) ) = ( x \ ( ( 0. X ) \ y ) ))) & ( 0.

proof
let G1 being  strict AbGroup,G2 being  strict AbGroup;
assume that
A7: (the carrier of G1) = (the carrier of X)
and
A8: (for x,y being (Element of X) holds ( (the addF of G1) . (x,y) ) = ( x \ ( ( 0. X ) \ y ) ))
and
A9: (( 0. G1 ) = ( 0. X ) & (the carrier of G2) = (the carrier of X))
and
A10: (for x,y being (Element of X) holds ( (the addF of G2) . (x,y) ) = ( x \ ( ( 0. X ) \ y ) ))
and
A11: ( 0. G2 ) = ( 0. X );
now
let a being (Element of G1),b being (Element of G1);
reconsider x = a,y = b as (Element of X) by A7;
thus ( (the addF of G1) . (a,b) ) = ( x \ ( ( 0. X ) \ y ) ) by A8
