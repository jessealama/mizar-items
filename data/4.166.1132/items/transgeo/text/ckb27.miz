theorem
(((((for a holds (for b holds (for x holds (for y holds (for z holds (for t holds ((([ [ x,y ],[ a,b ] ] in R & [ [ a,b ],[ z,t ] ] in R) & a <> b) implies [ [ x,y ],[ z,t ] ] in R))))))) & (for x holds (for y holds (for z holds [ [ x,x ],[ y,z ] ] in R)))) & R is_symmetric_in [: A,A :]) & f is_FormalIz_of R) implies f is_automorphism_of R)
proof
assume that
