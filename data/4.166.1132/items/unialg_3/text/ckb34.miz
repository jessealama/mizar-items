existence
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(for U1 being  strict (SubAlgebra of U01) holds (U1 = $1 implies (for S being (Subset of U02) holds (S = ( F .: (the carrier of U1) ) implies $2 = ( GenUnivAlg ( F .: (the carrier of U1) ) )))));
A1: (for u1 being set holds (u1 in (the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U01 )) implies (ex u2 being set st (u2 in (the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U02 )) & P[ u1,u2 ]))))
proof
let u1 being set;
assume u1 in (the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U01 ));
then consider U2 being  strict (SubAlgebra of U01) such that A2: U2 = u1 by CKB7:1;
reconsider u2 = ( GenUnivAlg ( F .: (the carrier of U2) ) ) as  strict (SubAlgebra of U02);
reconsider u2 as (Element of ( UnSubAlLattice U02 )) by UNIALG_2:def 14;
take u2;
thus thesis by A2;
end;
consider f1 being (Function of (the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U01 )),(the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U02 ))) such that A3: (for u1 being set holds (u1 in (the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U01 )) implies P[ u1,( f1 . u1 ) ])) from FUNCT_2:sch 1(A1);
take f1;
thus thesis
proof
let U1 being  strict (SubAlgebra of U01);
let S being (Subset of U02);
A4: U1 is (Element of ( Sub U01 )) by UNIALG_2:def 14;
assume S = ( F .: (the carrier of U1) );
hence thesis by A3,A4;

uniqueness
proof
let F1 being (Function of (the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U01 )),(the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U02 ))),F2 being (Function of (the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U01 )),(the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U02 )));
assume that
A5: (for U1 being  strict (SubAlgebra of U01) holds (for H being (Subset of U02) holds (H = ( F .: (the carrier of U1) ) implies ( F1 . U1 ) = ( GenUnivAlg H ))))
and
A6: (for U1 being  strict (SubAlgebra of U01) holds (for H being (Subset of U02) holds (H = ( F .: (the carrier of U1) ) implies ( F2 . U1 ) = ( GenUnivAlg H ))));
(for l being set holds (l in (the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U01 )) implies ( F1 . l ) = ( F2 . l )))
proof
let l being set;
assume l in (the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U01 ));
then consider U1 being  strict (SubAlgebra of U01) such that A7: U1 = l by CKB7:1;
consider H being (Subset of U02) such that A8: H = ( F .: (the carrier of U1) );
( F1 . l ) = ( GenUnivAlg H ) by A5,A7,A8;
hence thesis by A6,A7,A8;
end;
hence F1 = F2 by FUNCT_2:12;
