reserve U0 for Universal_Algebra;
theorem
(for U0 being  with_const_op  strict Universal_Algebra holds (for F being (Function of (the carrier of U0),(the carrier of U0)) holds (F = ( id (the carrier of U0) ) implies ( FuncLatt F ) = ( id (the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U0 )) ))))
proof
let U0 being  with_const_op  strict Universal_Algebra;
let F being (Function of (the carrier of U0),(the carrier of U0));
assume that
A1: F = ( id (the carrier of U0) );
A2: (for a being set holds (a in (the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U0 )) implies ( ( FuncLatt F ) . a ) = a))
proof
let a being set;
assume a in (the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U0 ));
then reconsider a as  strict (SubAlgebra of U0) by UNIALG_2:def 14;
(for a1 being set holds (a1 in (the carrier of a) implies a1 in ( F .: (the carrier of a) )))
proof
let a1 being set;
assume A3: a1 in (the carrier of a);
(the carrier of a) c= (the carrier of U0) by CKB9:1;
then reconsider a1 as (Element of U0) by A3;
( F . a1 ) = a1 by A1,FUNCT_1:17;
hence thesis by A3,FUNCT_2:35;
end;
then A4: (the carrier of a) c= ( F .: (the carrier of a) ) by TARSKI:def 3;
(for a1 being set holds (a1 in ( F .: (the carrier of a) ) implies a1 in (the carrier of a)))
proof
let a1 being set;
assume A5: a1 in ( F .: (the carrier of a) );
then reconsider a1 as (Element of U0);
(ex H being (Element of U0) st (H in (the carrier of a) & a1 = ( F . H ))) by A5,FUNCT_2:65;
hence thesis by A1,FUNCT_1:17;
end;
then A6: ( F .: (the carrier of a) ) c= (the carrier of a) by TARSKI:def 3;
then reconsider H1 = (the carrier of a) as (Subset of U0) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
( F .: (the carrier of a) ) = (the carrier of a) by A6,A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then ( ( FuncLatt F ) . a ) = ( GenUnivAlg H1 ) by CKB34:def 1;
hence thesis by UNIALG_2:19;
end;
( dom ( FuncLatt F ) ) = (the carrier of ( UnSubAlLattice U0 )) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence thesis by A2,FUNCT_1:17;
