theorem
Th17: (for U0 being  with_const_op Universal_Algebra holds (for l1,l2 being (Element of ( UnSubAlLattice U0 )) holds (for U1,U2 being  strict (SubAlgebra of U0) holds ((l1 = U1 & l2 = U2) implies (l1 [= l2 iff (the carrier of U1) c= (the carrier of U2))))))
proof
let U0 being  with_const_op Universal_Algebra;
let l1 being (Element of ( UnSubAlLattice U0 )),l2 being (Element of ( UnSubAlLattice U0 ));
let U1 being  strict (SubAlgebra of U0),U2 being  strict (SubAlgebra of U0);
reconsider l1 = U1 as (Element of ( UnSubAlLattice U0 )) by UNIALG_2:def 14;
reconsider l2 = U2 as (Element of ( UnSubAlLattice U0 )) by UNIALG_2:def 14;
A1: (l1 [= l2 implies (the carrier of U1) c= (the carrier of U2))
proof
reconsider U21 = (the carrier of U2) as (Subset of U0) by UNIALG_2:def 7;
reconsider U11 = (the carrier of U1) as (Subset of U0) by UNIALG_2:def 7;
reconsider U3 = ( U11 \/ U21 ) as non empty (Subset of U0);
assume l1 [= l2;
then ( l1 "\/" l2 ) = l2 by LATTICES:def 3;
then ( U1 "\/" U2 ) = U2 by UNIALG_2:def 15;
then ( GenUnivAlg U3 ) = U2 by UNIALG_2:def 13;
then A2: ( (the carrier of U1) \/ (the carrier of U2) ) c= (the carrier of U2) by UNIALG_2:def 12;
(the carrier of U2) c= ( (the carrier of U1) \/ (the carrier of U2) ) by XBOOLE_1:7;
then ( (the carrier of U1) \/ (the carrier of U2) ) = (the carrier of U2) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_1:7;
end;
((the carrier of U1) c= (the carrier of U2) implies l1 [= l2)
proof
reconsider U21 = (the carrier of U2) as (Subset of U0) by UNIALG_2:def 7;
reconsider U11 = (the carrier of U1) as (Subset of U0) by UNIALG_2:def 7;
reconsider U3 = ( U11 \/ U21 ) as non empty (Subset of U0);
assume (the carrier of U1) c= (the carrier of U2);
then ( GenUnivAlg U3 ) = U2 by UNIALG_2:19,XBOOLE_1:12;
then ( U1 "\/" U2 ) = U2 by UNIALG_2:def 13;
then ( l1 "\/" l2 ) = l2 by UNIALG_2:def 15;
hence thesis by LATTICES:def 3;
end;
hence thesis by A1;
