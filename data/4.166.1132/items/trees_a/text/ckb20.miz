theorem
( tree (T,{ t },T1) ) = ( T with-replacement (t,T1) )
proof
A1: ( dom ( tree (T,{ t },T1) ) ) = ( tree (( dom T ),{ t },( dom T1 )) ) by CKB13:def 1
.= ( ( dom T ) with-replacement (t,( dom T1 )) ) by CKB12:1
.= ( dom ( T with-replacement (t,T1) ) ) by TREES_2:def 11;
(for q holds (q in ( dom ( tree (T,{ t },T1) ) ) implies ( ( tree (T,{ t },T1) ) . q ) = ( ( T with-replacement (t,T1) ) . q )))
proof
let q;
assume A2: q in ( dom ( tree (T,{ t },T1) ) );
then A3: q in ( tree (( dom T ),{ t },( dom T1 )) ) by CKB13:def 1;
A4: ( tree (( dom T ),{ t },( dom T1 )) ) = ( { t1 where t1 is (Element of ( dom T )): (for p holds (p in { t } implies (not p is_a_prefix_of t1))) } \/ { ( p ^ s ) where p is (Element of ( dom T )),s is (Element of ( dom T1 )): p in { t } } ) by CKB8:1;
per cases  by A3,A4,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A5: q in { t1 where t1 is (Element of ( dom T )): (for p holds (p in { t } implies (not p is_a_prefix_of t1))) };

then consider t9 being (Element of ( dom T )) such that A6: q = t9 and A7: (for p holds (p in { t } implies (not p is_a_prefix_of t9)));
consider p such that A8: p = t;
p in { t } by A8,TARSKI:def 1;
then A9: (not p is_a_prefix_of t9) by A7;
((q in ( dom ( T with-replacement (t,T1) ) ) & q in { t1 where t1 is (Element of ( dom T )): (not p is_a_prefix_of t1) }) implies ( ( T with-replacement (t,T1) ) . q ) = ( T . q )) by A8,CKB17:1;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A5,A6,A9,CKB16:1;
end;
suppose A10: q in { ( p9 ^ s ) where p9 is (Element of ( dom T )),s is (Element of ( dom T1 )): p9 in { t } };

then consider p being (Element of ( dom T )),r being (Element of ( dom T1 )) such that A11: q = ( p ^ r ) and A12: p in { t };
A13: q in { ( p ^ s ) where s is (Element of ( dom T1 )): s = s } by A11;
consider p1 being (Element of ( dom T )),r1 being (Element of ( dom T1 )) such that A14: q = ( p1 ^ r1 ) and A15: p1 in { t } and A16: ( ( tree (T,{ t },T1) ) . q ) = ( T1 . r1 ) by A2,A10,CKB18:1;
A17: p1 = t by A15,TARSKI:def 1;
A18: p = t by A12,TARSKI:def 1;
then (ex r2 being (Element of ( dom T1 )) st (q = ( p ^ r2 ) & ( ( T with-replacement (p,T1) ) . q ) = ( T1 . r2 ))) by A1,A2,A13,CKB19:1;
hence thesis by A14,A16,A17,A18,FINSEQ_1:33;
