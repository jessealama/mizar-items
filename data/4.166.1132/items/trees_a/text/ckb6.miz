theorem
Th5: ( { t1 where t1 is (Element of T): (for p holds (p in P implies (not p is_a_proper_prefix_of t1))) } \ { t1 where t1 is (Element of T): (for p holds (p in P implies (not p is_a_prefix_of t1))) } ) = P
proof
now
let x being set;
assume A1: x in ( { t1 where t1 is (Element of T): (for p holds (p in P implies (not p is_a_proper_prefix_of t1))) } \ { t1 where t1 is (Element of T): (for p holds (p in P implies (not p is_a_prefix_of t1))) } );
then A2: x in { t1 where t1 is (Element of T): (for p holds (p in P implies (not p is_a_proper_prefix_of t1))) };
A3: (not x in { t1 where t1 is (Element of T): (for p holds (p in P implies (not p is_a_prefix_of t1))) }) by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
assume A4: (not x in P);
(ex t1 being (Element of T) st (x = t1 & (for p holds (p in P implies (not p is_a_prefix_of t1)))))
proof
consider t9 being (Element of T) such that A5: x = t9 and A6: (for p holds (p in P implies (not p is_a_proper_prefix_of t9))) by A2;
now
let p;
assume A7: p in P;
then A8: (not p is_a_proper_prefix_of t9) by A6;
per cases  by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 8;
suppose (not p is_a_prefix_of t9);

hence (not p is_a_prefix_of t9);
end;
suppose p = t9;

hence (not p is_a_prefix_of t9) by A4,A5,A7;
end;
end;
hence thesis by A5;
end;
hence contradiction by A3;
end;
hence ( { t1 where t1 is (Element of T): (for p holds (p in P implies (not p is_a_proper_prefix_of t1))) } \ { t1 where t1 is (Element of T): (for p holds (p in P implies (not p is_a_prefix_of t1))) } ) c= P by TARSKI:def 3;

assume A9: x in P;
A10: P c= { t1 where t1 is (Element of T): (for p holds (p in P implies (not p is_a_proper_prefix_of t1))) } by CKB5:1;
(not x in { t1 where t1 is (Element of T): (for p holds (p in P implies (not p is_a_prefix_of t1))) })
proof
assume x in { t1 where t1 is (Element of T): (for p holds (p in P implies (not p is_a_prefix_of t1))) };
then (ex t9 being (Element of T) st (x = t9 & (for p holds (p in P implies (not p is_a_prefix_of t9)))));
hence contradiction by A9;
