theorem
(p in P implies T1 = ( ( tree (T,P,T1) ) | p ))
proof
assume A1: p in P;
(ex q st (ex r st ((q in P & r in T1) & p = ( q ^ r ))))
proof
consider q such that A2: q = p;
consider r such that A3: r = ( <*> ( NAT ) );
A4: r in T1 by A3,TREES_1:22;
p = ( q ^ r ) by A2,A3,FINSEQ_1:34;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A4;
end;
then A5: p in ( tree (T,P,T1) ) by CKB2:def 1;
let x being (FinSequence of ( NAT ));
thus (x in T1 implies x in ( ( tree (T,P,T1) ) | p ))
proof
assume x in T1;
then ( p ^ x ) in ( tree (T,P,T1) ) by A1,CKB2:def 1;
hence thesis by A5,TREES_1:def 6;
end;

thus (x in ( ( tree (T,P,T1) ) | p ) implies x in T1)
proof
assume x in ( ( tree (T,P,T1) ) | p );
then A6: ( p ^ x ) in ( tree (T,P,T1) ) by A5,TREES_1:def 6;
A7:now
assume that
( p ^ x ) in T
and
A8: (for r holds (r in P implies (not r is_a_proper_prefix_of ( p ^ x ))));
A9: (not p is_a_proper_prefix_of ( p ^ x )) by A1,A8;
p is_a_prefix_of ( p ^ x ) by TREES_1:1;
then ( p ^ x ) = p by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 8
.= ( p ^ ( <*> ( NAT ) ) ) by FINSEQ_1:34;
then x = ( {} ) by FINSEQ_1:33;
hence thesis by TREES_1:22;
end;
now
given s,r such that
A10: s in P
and
A11: r in T1
and
A12: ( p ^ x ) = ( s ^ r );

now
assume s <> p;
then (not s,p are_c=-comparable ) by A1,A10,TREES_1:def 10;
hence contradiction by A12,CKB1:1;
end;
hence thesis by A11,A12,FINSEQ_1:33;
end;
hence thesis by A1,A6,A7,CKB2:def 1;
