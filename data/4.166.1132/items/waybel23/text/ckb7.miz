theorem
Th5: (for L being  complete sup-Semilattice holds (for S being  join-inheriting non  empty  full (SubRelStr of L) holds (( Bottom L ) in (the carrier of S) implies (for X being (Subset of L) holds (for Y being (Subset of S) holds (X = Y implies ( finsups Y ) c= ( finsups X )))))))
proof
let L being  complete sup-Semilattice;
let S being  join-inheriting non  empty  full (SubRelStr of L);
assume A1: ( Bottom L ) in (the carrier of S);
let X being (Subset of L);
let Y being (Subset of S);
assume A2: X = Y;
let x being set;
assume x in ( finsups Y );
then x in { ( "\/" (V,S) ) where V is  finite (Subset of Y):  ex_sup_of V,S } by WAYBEL_0:def 27;
then consider Z being  finite (Subset of Y) such that A3: x = ( "\/" (Z,S) ) and A4:  ex_sup_of Z,S;
reconsider Z as  finite (Subset of X) by A2;
now
per cases ;
suppose Z is non  empty;

then reconsider Z1 = Z as  finite non  empty (Subset of S) by XBOOLE_1:1;
reconsider xl = ( "\/" (Z1,L) ) as (Element of S) by WAYBEL21:15;
A5:  ex_sup_of Z1,L by YELLOW_0:17;
A6:now
let b being (Element of S);
reconsider b1 = b as (Element of L) by YELLOW_0:58;
assume A7: b is_>=_than Z1;
b1 is_>=_than Z1
proof
let c1 being (Element of L);
assume A8: c1 in Z1;
then reconsider c = c1 as (Element of S);
c <= b by A7,A8,LATTICE3:def 9;
hence c1 <= b1 by YELLOW_0:59;
end;
then ( "\/" (Z1,L) ) <= b1 by A5,YELLOW_0:30;
hence xl <= b by YELLOW_0:60;
end;
A9: ( "\/" (Z1,L) ) is_>=_than Z1 by A5,YELLOW_0:30;
xl is_>=_than Z1
proof
let b being (Element of S);
reconsider b1 = b as (Element of L) by YELLOW_0:58;
assume b in Z1;
then b1 <= ( "\/" (Z1,L) ) by A9,LATTICE3:def 9;
hence b <= xl by YELLOW_0:60;
end;
then ( "\/" (Z1,S) ) = ( "\/" (Z1,L) ) by A6,YELLOW_0:30;
then x in { ( "\/" (V,L) ) where V is  finite (Subset of X):  ex_sup_of V,L } by A3,A5;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:def 27;
end;
suppose A10: Z is  empty;

reconsider dL = ( Bottom L ) as (Element of S) by A1;
reconsider dS = ( Bottom S ) as (Element of L) by YELLOW_0:58;
S is  lower-bounded by A4,A10,WAYBEL20:6;
then ( Bottom S ) <= dL by YELLOW_0:44;
then A11: dS <= ( Bottom L ) by YELLOW_0:59;
A12:  ex_sup_of Z,L by YELLOW_0:17;
( Bottom L ) <= dS by YELLOW_0:44;
then dS = ( Bottom L ) by A11,YELLOW_0:def 3;
then x in { ( "\/" (V,L) ) where V is  finite (Subset of X):  ex_sup_of V,L } by A3,A10,A12;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:def 27;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
