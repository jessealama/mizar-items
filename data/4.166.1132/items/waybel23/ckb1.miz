theorem
Th1: (for L being non empty Poset holds (for x being (Element of L) holds ( compactbelow x ) = ( ( waybelow x ) /\ (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) )))
proof
let L being non empty Poset;
let x being (Element of L);
A1: ( compactbelow x ) c= ( ( waybelow x ) /\ (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) )
proof
let y being set;
assume A2: y in ( compactbelow x );
then reconsider y1 = y as (Element of L);
A3: y in ( ( downarrow x ) /\ (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) ) by A2,WAYBEL_8:5;
then y in ( downarrow x ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A4: y1 <= x by WAYBEL_0:17;
A5: y in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then y1 is  compact by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
then y1 << y1 by WAYBEL_3:def 2;
then y1 << x by A4,WAYBEL_3:2;
then y1 in ( waybelow x ) by WAYBEL_3:7;
hence thesis by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
( ( waybelow x ) /\ (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) ) c= ( compactbelow x )
proof
let y being set;
assume A6: y in ( ( waybelow x ) /\ (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) );
then reconsider y1 = y as (Element of L);
y in ( waybelow x ) by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then y1 << x by WAYBEL_3:7;
then y1 <= x by WAYBEL_3:1;
then A7: y in ( downarrow x ) by WAYBEL_0:17;
y in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then y in ( ( downarrow x ) /\ (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) ) by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_8:5;
