theorem
Th2: (for L being  reflexive  antisymmetric  with_infima RelStr holds (for a being (Element of L) holds ( a "/\" a ) = a))
proof
let L being  reflexive  antisymmetric  with_infima RelStr;
let a being (Element of L);
a <= a;
then (( a "/\" a ) <= a & a <= ( a "/\" a )) by YELLOW_0:23;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:def 3;
