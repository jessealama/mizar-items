theorem
(for L being  antisymmetric  transitive  with_suprema  with_infima RelStr holds (for a,b,c being (Element of L) holds ( a "/\" b ) <= ( a "\/" c )))
proof
let L being  antisymmetric  transitive  with_suprema  with_infima RelStr;
let a being (Element of L),b being (Element of L),c being (Element of L);
(( a "/\" b ) <= a & a <= ( a "\/" c )) by YELLOW_0:22,YELLOW_0:23;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:def 2;
