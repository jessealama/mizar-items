theorem
Th6: (for L being  antisymmetric  transitive  with_infima RelStr holds (for a,b,c being (Element of L) holds (a <= b implies ( a "/\" c ) <= ( b "/\" c ))))
proof
let L being  antisymmetric  transitive  with_infima RelStr;
let a being (Element of L),b being (Element of L),c being (Element of L);
A1: ( a "/\" c ) <= a by YELLOW_0:23;
A2: ( a "/\" c ) <= c by YELLOW_0:23;
assume a <= b;
then ( a "/\" c ) <= b by A1,YELLOW_0:def 2;
hence thesis by A2,YELLOW_0:23;
