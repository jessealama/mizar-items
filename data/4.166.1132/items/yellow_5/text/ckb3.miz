theorem
(for L being  transitive  antisymmetric  with_suprema RelStr holds (for a,b,c being (Element of L) holds (( a "\/" b ) <= c implies a <= c)))
proof
let L being  transitive  antisymmetric  with_suprema RelStr;
let a being (Element of L);
let b being (Element of L);
let c being (Element of L);
A1: a <= ( a "\/" b ) by YELLOW_0:22;
assume ( a "\/" b ) <= c;
hence thesis by A1,YELLOW_0:def 2;
