theorem
(for L being  transitive  antisymmetric  with_infima RelStr holds (for a,b,c being (Element of L) holds (c <= ( a "/\" b ) implies c <= a)))
proof
let L being  transitive  antisymmetric  with_infima RelStr;
let a being (Element of L),b being (Element of L),c being (Element of L);
A1: ( a "/\" b ) <= a by YELLOW_0:23;
assume c <= ( a "/\" b );
hence thesis by A1,YELLOW_0:def 2;
