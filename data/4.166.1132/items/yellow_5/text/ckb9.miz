theorem
Th9: (for L being sup-Semilattice holds (for a,b,c being (Element of L) holds ((a <= c & b <= c) implies ( a "\/" b ) <= c)))
proof
let L being sup-Semilattice;
let a being (Element of L);
let b being (Element of L);
let c being (Element of L);
assume that
A1: a <= c
and
A2: b <= c;
( c "\/" b ) = c by A2,CKB8:1;
hence thesis by A1,CKB7:1;
end;
