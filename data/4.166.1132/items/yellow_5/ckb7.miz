theorem
Th7: (for L being  antisymmetric  transitive  with_suprema RelStr holds (for a,b,c being (Element of L) holds (a <= b implies ( a "\/" c ) <= ( b "\/" c ))))
proof
let L being non empty  antisymmetric  transitive  with_suprema RelStr;
let a being (Element of L),b being (Element of L),c being (Element of L);
A1: b <= ( b "\/" c ) by YELLOW_0:22;
A2: c <= ( b "\/" c ) by YELLOW_0:22;
assume a <= b;
then a <= ( b "\/" c ) by A1,YELLOW_0:def 2;
hence thesis by A2,YELLOW_0:22;
