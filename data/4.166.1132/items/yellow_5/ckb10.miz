theorem
Th10: (for L being Semilattice holds (for a,b being (Element of L) holds (b <= a implies ( a "/\" b ) = b)))
proof
let L being Semilattice;
let a being (Element of L),b being (Element of L);
assume b <= a;
then ( b "/\" b ) <= ( a "/\" b ) by CKB6:1;
then (( a "/\" b ) <= b & b <= ( a "/\" b )) by CKB2:1,YELLOW_0:23;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:def 3;
