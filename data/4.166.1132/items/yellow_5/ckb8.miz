theorem
Th8: (for L being sup-Semilattice holds (for a,b being (Element of L) holds (a <= b implies ( a "\/" b ) = b)))
proof
let L being sup-Semilattice;
let a being (Element of L),b being (Element of L);
A1: b <= b;
assume a <= b;
then (b <= ( a "\/" b ) & ( a "\/" b ) <= b) by A1,YELLOW_0:22;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:def 3;
