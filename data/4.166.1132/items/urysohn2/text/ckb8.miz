theorem
Th10: (for A being non  empty Interval holds (for x being Real holds (x <> ( 0 ) implies (A is  closed_interval implies ( x ** A ) is  closed_interval))))
proof
let A being non  empty Interval;
let x being Real;
assume A1: x <> ( 0 );
assume A is  closed_interval;
then consider a,b being  real number such that A2: A = [. a,b .] by MEASURE5:def 3;
