theorem
Th12: (for A being non empty Interval holds (for x being Real holds (x < ( 0 ) implies (A is  right_open_interval implies ( x ** A ) is  left_open_interval))))
proof
let A being non empty Interval;
let x being Real;
assume A1: x < ( 0 );
assume A is  right_open_interval;
then consider a being  real number,b being R_eal such that A2: A = [. a,b .[ by MEASURE5:def 4;
A3: a < b by A2,XXREAL_1:27;
reconsider a as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
now
per cases  by A3,CKB5:1;
case (a = ( -infty ) & b = ( -infty ));
hence thesis;
end;
case (a = ( -infty ) & b in ( REAL ));
hence thesis;
end;
case (a = ( -infty ) & b = ( +infty ));
hence thesis;
end;

then consider r being Real such that A5: r = b;
( x * r ) is R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
then consider g being R_eal such that A6: g = ( x * r );

( x * s ) is R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
then consider d being R_eal such that A8: d = ( x * s );
