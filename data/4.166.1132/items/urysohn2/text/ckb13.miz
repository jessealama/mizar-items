theorem
(for A being non  empty Interval holds (for x being Real holds (( 0 ) < x implies (for B being non  empty Interval holds (B = ( x ** A ) implies (A = [. ( inf A ),( sup A ) .] implies (B = [. ( inf B ),( sup B ) .] & (for s,t being Real holds ((s = ( inf A ) & t = ( sup A )) implies (( inf B ) = ( x * s ) & ( sup B ) = ( x * t )))))))))))
proof
let A being non  empty Interval;
let x being Real;
assume A1: ( 0 ) < x;
let B being non  empty Interval;
assume A2: B = ( x ** A );
(A = [. ( inf A ),( sup A ) .] implies (B = [. ( inf B ),( sup B ) .] & (for s,t being Real holds ((s = ( inf A ) & t = ( sup A )) implies (( inf B ) = ( x * s ) & ( sup B ) = ( x * t ))))))
proof
assume A3: A = [. ( inf A ),( sup A ) .];
A4: (for s,t being Real holds ((s = ( inf A ) & t = ( sup A )) implies (( inf B ) = ( x * s ) & ( sup B ) = ( x * t ))))
proof
let s being Real;
let t being Real;
assume that
A5: s = ( inf A )
and
A6: t = ( sup A );
(( inf B ) = ( x * s ) & ( sup B ) = ( x * t ))
proof
s <= t by A5,A6,XXREAL_2:40;
then A7: ( x * s ) <= ( x * t ) by A1,XREAL_1:64;
( x * s ) is R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
then consider d being R_eal such that A8: d = ( x * s );
( x * t ) is R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
then consider g being R_eal such that A9: g = ( x * t );
A10: [. d,g .] c= ( x ** A )
proof
let q being set;
assume A11: q in [. d,g .];
then reconsider q as Real by A8,A9,XREAL_0:def 1;
set q2 = ( q / x );
reconsider q1 = q as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
A12: q2 in A
proof
q2 is R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
then consider q3 being R_eal such that A13: q3 = q2;
A14: q3 <= ( sup A )
proof
q1 <= g by A11,XXREAL_1:1;
then consider p,o being Real such that A15: (p = q1 & o = g) and A16: p <= o by A9;
( p / x ) <= ( o / x ) by A1,A16,XREAL_1:72;
hence thesis by A1,A6,A9,A13,A15,XCMPLX_1:89;
end;
( inf A ) <= q3
proof
(d <= q1 & ( x * q2 ) = q) by A1,A11,XCMPLX_1:87,XXREAL_1:1;
hence thesis by A1,A5,A8,A13,XREAL_1:68;
end;
hence thesis by A3,A13,A14,XXREAL_1:1;
end;
q = ( x * q2 ) by A1,XCMPLX_1:87;
hence thesis by A12,MEMBER_1:193;
end;
( x ** A ) c= [. d,g .]
proof
let q being set;
assume A17: q in ( x ** A );
then reconsider q as Real;
consider z2 being Real such that A18: z2 in A and A19: q = ( x * z2 ) by A17,INTEGRA2:39;
reconsider z2 as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
( inf A ) <= z2 by A3,A18,XXREAL_1:1;
then consider 1o,1ra being Real such that A20: (1o = ( inf A ) & 1ra = z2) and A21: 1o <= 1ra by A5;
A22: ( x * 1o ) <= ( x * 1ra ) by A1,A21,XREAL_1:64;
z2 <= ( sup A ) by A3,A18,XXREAL_1:1;
then consider 2o,2r being Real such that A23: (2o = z2 & 2r = ( sup A )) and A24: 2o <= 2r by A6;
(( x * 2o ) is R_eal & ( x * 2r ) is R_eal) by XXREAL_0:def 1;
then consider 2o1,2r1 being R_eal such that A25: (2o1 = ( x * 2o ) & 2r1 = ( x * 2r ));
2o1 <= 2r1 by A1,A24,A25,XREAL_1:64;
hence thesis by A5,A6,A8,A9,A19,A20,A23,A22,A25,XXREAL_1:1;
end;
then ( x ** A ) = [. d,g .] by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by A2,A8,A9,A7,MEASURE6:10,MEASURE6:14;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
( inf A ) <= ( sup A ) by XXREAL_2:40;
then (( inf A ) in A & ( sup A ) in A) by A3,XXREAL_1:1;
then A is  closed_interval by A3,MEASURE5:def 3;
then ( x ** A ) is  closed_interval by A1,CKB8:1;
hence thesis by A2,A4,MEASURE6:17;
end;
hence thesis;
