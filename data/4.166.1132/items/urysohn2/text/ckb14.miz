theorem
(for A being non empty Interval holds (for x being Real holds (( 0 ) < x implies (for B being non empty Interval holds (B = ( x ** A ) implies (A = ]. ( inf A ),( sup A ) .] implies (B = ]. ( inf B ),( sup B ) .] & (for s,t being Real holds ((s = ( inf A ) & t = ( sup A )) implies (( inf B ) = ( x * s ) & ( sup B ) = ( x * t )))))))))))
proof
let A being non empty Interval;
let x being Real;
assume A1: ( 0 ) < x;
let B being non empty Interval;
assume A2: B = ( x ** A );
A3: ( inf A ) <= ( sup A ) by XXREAL_2:40;
assume A4: A = ]. ( inf A ),( sup A ) .];
then ( inf A ) <> ( sup A );
then ( inf A ) < ( sup A ) by A3,XXREAL_0:1;
then ( sup A ) in A by A4,XXREAL_1:2;
then reconsider b = ( sup A ) as  real number;
A5: (for s,t being Real holds ((s = ( inf A ) & t = ( sup A )) implies (( inf B ) = ( x * s ) & ( sup B ) = ( x * t ))))
proof
let s being Real,t being Real;
assume that
A6: s = ( inf A )
and
A7: t = ( sup A );
(( inf B ) = ( x * s ) & ( sup B ) = ( x * t ))
proof
s <= t by A6,A7,XXREAL_2:40;
then A8: ( x * s ) <= ( x * t ) by A1,XREAL_1:64;
( x * s ) is R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
then consider d being R_eal such that A9: d = ( x * s );
( x * t ) is R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
then consider g being R_eal such that A10: g = ( x * t );
A11: ]. d,g .] c= ( x ** A )
proof
let q being set;
assume A12: q in ]. d,g .];
then reconsider q as Real by A10,XREAL_0:def 1;
set q2 = ( q / x );
reconsider q1 = q as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
A13: q2 in A
proof
reconsider q3 = q2 as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
A14: q3 <= ( sup A )
proof
q1 <= g by A12,XXREAL_1:2;
then consider p being Real,o being Real such that A15: (p = q1 & o = g) and A16: p <= o by A10;
( p / x ) <= ( o / x ) by A1,A16,XREAL_1:72;
hence thesis by A1,A7,A10,A15,XCMPLX_1:89;
end;
(d < q1 & ( x * q2 ) = q) by A1,A12,XCMPLX_1:87,XXREAL_1:2;
then ( inf A ) < q3 by A1,A6,A9,XREAL_1:64;
hence thesis by A4,A14,XXREAL_1:2;
end;
q = ( x * q2 ) by A1,XCMPLX_1:87;
hence thesis by A13,MEMBER_1:193;
end;
( x ** A ) c= ]. d,g .]
proof
let q being set;
assume A17: q in ( x ** A );
then reconsider q as Real;
consider z2 being Real such that A18: z2 in A and A19: q = ( x * z2 ) by A17,INTEGRA2:39;
reconsider z2 as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
reconsider q as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
( inf A ) <= z2 by A4,A18,XXREAL_1:2;
then consider 1o being Real,1ra being Real such that A20: (1o = ( inf A ) & 1ra = z2) and 1o <= 1ra by A6;
1o < 1ra by A4,A18,A20,XXREAL_1:2;
then A21: d < q by A1,A6,A9,A19,A20,XREAL_1:68;
z2 <= ( sup A ) by A4,A18,XXREAL_1:2;
then consider 2o being Real,2r being Real such that A22: (2o = z2 & 2r = ( sup A )) and A23: 2o <= 2r by A7;
( x * 2o ) <= ( x * 2r ) by A1,A23,XREAL_1:64;
hence thesis by A7,A10,A19,A22,A21,XXREAL_1:2;
end;
then ( x ** A ) = ]. d,g .] by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by A2,A9,A10,A8,MEASURE6:9,MEASURE6:13;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
A = ]. ( inf A ),b .] by A4;
then A is  left_open_interval by MEASURE5:def 5;
then B is  left_open_interval by A1,A2,CKB11:1;
hence thesis by A5,MEASURE6:19;
