theorem
Th11: (for A being non  empty Interval holds (for x being Real holds (( 0 ) < x implies (A is  right_open_interval implies ( x ** A ) is  right_open_interval))))
proof
let A being non  empty Interval;
let x being Real;
assume A1: ( 0 ) < x;
assume A is  right_open_interval;
then consider a being  real number,b being R_eal such that A2: A = [. a,b .[ by MEASURE5:def 4;

reconsider a as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
