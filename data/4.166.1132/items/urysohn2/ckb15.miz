theorem
(for A being non empty Interval holds (for x being Real holds (( 0 ) < x implies (for B being non empty Interval holds (B = ( x ** A ) implies (A = ]. ( inf A ),( sup A ) .[ implies (B = ]. ( inf B ),( sup B ) .[ & (for s,t being Real holds ((s = ( inf A ) & t = ( sup A )) implies (( inf B ) = ( x * s ) & ( sup B ) = ( x * t )))))))))))
proof
let A being non empty Interval;
let x being Real;
assume A1: ( 0 ) < x;
let B being non empty Interval;
assume A2: B = ( x ** A );
(A = ]. ( inf A ),( sup A ) .[ implies (B = ]. ( inf B ),( sup B ) .[ & (for s,t being Real holds ((s = ( inf A ) & t = ( sup A )) implies (( inf B ) = ( x * s ) & ( sup B ) = ( x * t ))))))
proof
assume A3: A = ]. ( inf A ),( sup A ) .[;
A4: (for s,t being Real holds ((s = ( inf A ) & t = ( sup A )) implies ((( inf B ) = ( x * s ) & ( sup B ) = ( x * t )) & B is  open_interval)))
proof
let s being Real,t being Real;
assume that
A5: s = ( inf A )
and
A6: t = ( sup A );
((( inf B ) = ( x * s ) & ( sup B ) = ( x * t )) & B is  open_interval)
proof
s <= t by A5,A6,XXREAL_2:40;
then A7: ( x * s ) <= ( x * t ) by A1,XREAL_1:64;
( x * s ) is R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
then consider d being R_eal such that A8: d = ( x * s );
( x * t ) is R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
then consider g being R_eal such that A9: g = ( x * t );
A10: ]. d,g .[ c= ( x ** A )
proof
let q being set;
assume A11: q in ]. d,g .[;
then reconsider q as Real;
set q2 = ( q / x );
q is R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
then consider q1 being R_eal such that A12: q1 = q;
A13: q1 < g by A11,A12,MEASURE5:def 1;
A14: q2 in A
proof
q2 is R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
then consider q3 being R_eal such that A15: q3 = q2;
A16: q3 < ( sup A )
proof
consider p being Real,o being Real such that A17: (p = q1 & o = g) and p <= o by A9,A12,A13;
( p / x ) < ( o / x ) by A1,A13,A17,XREAL_1:74;
hence thesis by A1,A6,A9,A12,A15,A17,XCMPLX_1:89;
end;
(d < q1 & ( x * q2 ) = q) by A1,A11,A12,MEASURE5:def 1,XCMPLX_1:87;
then ( inf A ) < q3 by A1,A5,A8,A12,A15,XREAL_1:64;
hence thesis by A3,A15,A16,MEASURE5:def 1;
end;
q = ( x * ( q / x ) ) by A1,XCMPLX_1:87;
hence thesis by A14,MEMBER_1:193;
end;
( x ** A ) c= ]. d,g .[
proof
let q being set;
assume A18: q in ( x ** A );
then reconsider q as Real;
consider z2 being Real such that A19: z2 in A and A20: q = ( x * z2 ) by A18,INTEGRA2:39;
reconsider z2 as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
( inf A ) <= z2 by A3,A19,MEASURE5:def 1;
then consider 1o being Real,1ra being Real such that A21: (1o = ( inf A ) & 1ra = z2) and 1o <= 1ra by A5;
1o < 1ra by A3,A19,A21,MEASURE5:def 1;
then A22: ( x * 1o ) < ( x * 1ra ) by A1,XREAL_1:68;
z2 <= ( sup A ) by A3,A19,MEASURE5:def 1;
then consider 2o being Real,2r being Real such that A23: (2o = z2 & 2r = ( sup A )) and 2o <= 2r by A6;
(( x * 2o ) is R_eal & ( x * 2r ) is R_eal) by XXREAL_0:def 1;
then consider 2o1 being R_eal,2r1 being R_eal such that A24: (2o1 = ( x * 2o ) & 2r1 = ( x * 2r ));
2o < 2r by A3,A19,A23,MEASURE5:def 1;
then 2o1 < 2r1 by A1,A24,XREAL_1:68;
hence thesis by A5,A6,A8,A9,A20,A21,A23,A22,A24,MEASURE5:def 1;
end;
then ( x ** A ) = ]. d,g .[ by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by A2,A8,A9,A7,MEASURE5:def 2,MEASURE6:8,MEASURE6:12;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
A is  open_interval by A3,MEASURE5:def 2;
then ( x ** A ) is  open_interval by A1,CKB7:1;
hence thesis by A2,A4,MEASURE6:16;

hence thesis;
