reserve x for set;
reserve k for (Element of ( NAT ));
theorem
Lm2: (for k holds ((x = ( - k ) & k <> x) implies x in ( [: { ( 0 ) },( NAT ) :] \ { [ ( 0 ),( 0 ) ] } )))
proof
let k;
assume that
A1: x = ( - k )
and
A2: k <> x;
reconsider r = x as (Element of ( REAL )) by A1;
( r + k ) = ( 0 ) by A1;
then consider x1 being (Element of ( REAL )),x2 being (Element of ( REAL )),y1 being (Element of ( REAL )),y2 being (Element of ( REAL )) such that A3: r = [* x1,x2 *] and A4: k = [* y1,y2 *] and A5: ( 0 ) = [* ( + (x1,y1) ),( + (x2,y2) ) *] by XCMPLX_0:def 4;
A6: y2 = ( 0 ) by A4,ARYTM_0:24;
then A7: y1 = k by A4,ARYTM_0:def 5;
( + (x2,y2) ) = ( 0 ) by A5,ARYTM_0:24;
then A8: ( + (x1,y1) ) = ( 0 ) by A5,ARYTM_0:def 5;
A9: k in ( omega );
A10:now
assume x1 in ( REAL+ );
then consider x9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )),y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A11: x1 = x9 and A12: y1 = y9 and A13: ( 0 ) = ( x9 + y9 ) by A9,A7,A8,ARYTM_0:def 1,ARYTM_2:2;
A14: y9 = ( 0 ) by A13,ARYTM_2:5;
x9 = ( 0 ) by A13,ARYTM_2:5;
hence contradiction by A2,A3,A4,A6,A11,A12,A14,ARYTM_0:24;
end;
x2 = ( 0 ) by A3,ARYTM_0:24;
then A15: x1 = r by A3,ARYTM_0:def 5;
r in ( ( REAL+ ) \/ [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] ) by NUMBERS:def 1,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then x in [: { ( 0 ) },( REAL+ ) :] by A15,A10,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then consider x9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )),y9 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A16: x1 = [ ( 0 ),x9 ] and A17: y1 = y9 and A18: ( 0 ) = ( y9 - x9 ) by A9,A15,A7,A8,ARYTM_0:def 1,ARYTM_2:2;
A19: ( 0 ) in { ( 0 ) } by TARSKI:def 1;
A20: (not r in { [ ( 0 ),( 0 ) ] }) by NUMBERS:def 1,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
x9 = y9 by A18,ARYTM_0:6;
then x in [: { ( 0 ) },( NAT ) :] by A15,A7,A16,A17,A19,ZFMISC_1:87;
hence thesis by A20,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
