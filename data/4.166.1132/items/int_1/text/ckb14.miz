proof
consider l such that A1: (i2 = l or i2 = ( - l )) by CKB10:1;
consider k such that A2: (i1 = k or i1 = ( - k )) by CKB10:1;
A3:now
A4:now
assume ( l - k ) <= ( 0 );
then l <= ( ( 0 ) + k ) by XREAL_1:20;
then consider z being Nat such that A5: k = ( l + z ) by NAT_1:10;
( - z ) = ( ( - k ) + l ) by A5;
hence ( l - k ) is Integer by CKB9:1;
end;
assume that
A6: i1 = ( - k )
and
A7: i2 = l;
now
assume ( 0 ) <= ( l - k );
then ( ( 0 ) + k ) <= l by XREAL_1:19;
then (ex z being Nat st l = ( k + z )) by NAT_1:10;
hence ( l - k ) is Integer;
end;
hence ( i1 + i2 ) is Integer by A6,A7,A4;
end;
A8:now
A9:now
assume ( k - l ) <= ( 0 );
then k <= ( ( 0 ) + l ) by XREAL_1:20;
then consider z being Nat such that A10: l = ( k + z ) by NAT_1:10;
( - z ) = ( ( - l ) + k ) by A10;
hence ( k - l ) is Integer by CKB9:1;
end;
assume that
A11: i1 = k
and
A12: i2 = ( - l );
now
assume ( 0 ) <= ( k - l );
then ( ( 0 ) + l ) <= k by XREAL_1:19;
then (ex z being Nat st k = ( l + z )) by NAT_1:10;
hence ( k - l ) is Integer;
end;
hence ( i1 + i2 ) is Integer by A11,A12,A9;
end;
now
assume that
A13: i1 = ( - k )
and
A14: i2 = ( - l );
( i1 + i2 ) = ( - ( k + l ) ) by A13,A14;
hence ( i1 + i2 ) is Integer by CKB9:1;
end;
hence thesis by A2,A1,A8,A3;
