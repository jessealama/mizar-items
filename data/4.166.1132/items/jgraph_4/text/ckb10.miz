theorem
Th14: (for X being non  empty TopSpace holds (for f1,f2 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) holds (for a,b being  real number holds ((((f1 is  continuous & f2 is  continuous) & b <> ( 0 )) & (for q being (Point of X) holds ( f2 . q ) <> ( 0 ))) implies (ex g being (Function of X,( R^1 )) st ((for p being (Point of X) holds (for r1,r2 being  real number holds ((( f1 . p ) = r1 & ( f2 . p ) = r2) implies ( g . p ) = ( r2 * ( - ( sqrt ( abs ( 1 - ( ( ( ( r1 / r2 ) - a ) / b ) ^2 ) ) ) ) ) )))) & g is  continuous))))))
proof
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
let f1 being (Function of X,( R^1 ));
let f2 being (Function of X,( R^1 ));
let a being  real number;
let b being  real number;
assume that
A1: f1 is  continuous
and
A2: f2 is  continuous
and
A3: (b <> ( 0 ) & (for q being (Point of X) holds ( f2 . q ) <> ( 0 )));
consider g1 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) such that A4: (for p being (Point of X) holds (for r1,r2 being  real number holds ((( f1 . p ) = r1 & ( f2 . p ) = r2) implies ( g1 . p ) = ( ( ( r1 / r2 ) - a ) / b )))) and A5: g1 is  continuous by A1,A2,A3,CKB5:1;
consider g2 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) such that A6: (for p being (Point of X) holds (for s being  real number holds (( g1 . p ) = s implies ( g2 . p ) = ( s ^2 )))) and A7: g2 is  continuous by A5,CKB7:1;
consider g0 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) such that A8: (for p being (Point of X) holds ( g0 . p ) = 1) and A9: g0 is  continuous by JGRAPH_2:20;
consider g3 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) such that A10: (for p being (Point of X) holds (for s,t being  real number holds ((( g0 . p ) = s & ( g2 . p ) = t) implies ( g3 . p ) = ( s - t )))) and A11: g3 is  continuous by A7,A9,JGRAPH_2:21;
consider g4 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) such that A12: (for p being (Point of X) holds (for s being  real number holds (( g3 . p ) = s implies ( g4 . p ) = ( abs s )))) and A13: g4 is  continuous by A11,CKB8:1;
(for q being (Point of X) holds (ex r being  real number st (( g4 . q ) = r & r >= ( 0 ))))
proof
let q being (Point of X);
reconsider s = ( g3 . q ) as Real by TOPMETR:17;
( g4 . q ) = ( abs s ) by A12;
hence thesis by COMPLEX1:46;
end;
then consider g5 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) such that A14: (for p being (Point of X) holds (for s being  real number holds (( g4 . p ) = s implies ( g5 . p ) = ( sqrt s )))) and A15: g5 is  continuous by A13,JGRAPH_3:5;
consider g6 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) such that A16: (for p being (Point of X) holds (for s being  real number holds (( g5 . p ) = s implies ( g6 . p ) = ( - s )))) and A17: g6 is  continuous by A15,CKB9:1;
consider g7 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) such that A18: (for p being (Point of X) holds (for r1,r0 being  real number holds ((( f2 . p ) = r1 & ( g6 . p ) = r0) implies ( g7 . p ) = ( r1 * r0 )))) and A19: g7 is  continuous by A2,A17,JGRAPH_2:25;
(for p being (Point of X) holds (for r1,r2 being  real number holds ((( f1 . p ) = r1 & ( f2 . p ) = r2) implies ( g7 . p ) = ( r2 * ( - ( sqrt ( abs ( 1 - ( ( ( ( r1 / r2 ) - a ) / b ) ^2 ) ) ) ) ) ))))
proof
let p being (Point of X);
let r1 being  real number;
let r2 being  real number;
assume that
A20: ( f1 . p ) = r1
and
A21: ( f2 . p ) = r2;
A22: ( g0 . p ) = 1 by A8;
( g1 . p ) = ( ( ( r1 / r2 ) - a ) / b ) by A4,A20,A21;
then ( g2 . p ) = ( ( ( ( r1 / r2 ) - a ) / b ) ^2 ) by A6;
then ( g3 . p ) = ( 1 - ( ( ( ( r1 / r2 ) - a ) / b ) ^2 ) ) by A10,A22;
then ( g4 . p ) = ( abs ( 1 - ( ( ( ( r1 / r2 ) - a ) / b ) ^2 ) ) ) by A12;
then ( g5 . p ) = ( sqrt ( abs ( 1 - ( ( ( ( r1 / r2 ) - a ) / b ) ^2 ) ) ) ) by A14;
then ( g6 . p ) = ( - ( sqrt ( abs ( 1 - ( ( ( ( r1 / r2 ) - a ) / b ) ^2 ) ) ) ) ) by A16;
hence thesis by A18,A21;
end;
hence thesis by A19;
