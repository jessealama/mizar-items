theorem
Th10: (for X being non  empty TopSpace holds (for f1,f2 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) holds (for a,b being Real holds ((((f1 is  continuous & f2 is  continuous) & b <> ( 0 )) & (for q being (Point of X) holds ( f2 . q ) <> ( 0 ))) implies (ex g being (Function of X,( R^1 )) st ((for p being (Point of X) holds (for r1,r2 being Real holds ((( f1 . p ) = r1 & ( f2 . p ) = r2) implies ( g . p ) = ( r2 * ( ( ( r1 / r2 ) - a ) / b ) )))) & g is  continuous))))))
proof
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
let f1 being (Function of X,( R^1 ));
let f2 being (Function of X,( R^1 ));
let a being Real;
let b being Real;
assume that
A1: f1 is  continuous
and
A2: f2 is  continuous
and
A3: b <> ( 0 )
and
A4: (for q being (Point of X) holds ( f2 . q ) <> ( 0 ));
consider g3 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) such that A5: (for p being (Point of X) holds (for r1,r0 being  real number holds ((( f1 . p ) = r1 & ( f2 . p ) = r0) implies ( g3 . p ) = ( r1 / r0 )))) and A6: g3 is  continuous by A1,A2,A4,JGRAPH_2:27;
consider g1 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) such that A7: (for p being (Point of X) holds (( g1 . p ) = b & g1 is  continuous)) by JGRAPH_2:20;
consider g2 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) such that A8: (for p being (Point of X) holds (( g2 . p ) = a & g2 is  continuous)) by JGRAPH_2:20;
consider g4 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) such that A9: (for p being (Point of X) holds (for r1,r0 being  real number holds ((( g3 . p ) = r1 & ( g2 . p ) = r0) implies ( g4 . p ) = ( r1 - r0 )))) and A10: g4 is  continuous by A8,A6,JGRAPH_2:21;
(for q being (Point of X) holds ( g1 . q ) <> ( 0 )) by A3,A7;
then consider g5 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) such that A11: (for p being (Point of X) holds (for r1,r0 being  real number holds ((( g4 . p ) = r1 & ( g1 . p ) = r0) implies ( g5 . p ) = ( r1 / r0 )))) and A12: g5 is  continuous by A7,A10,JGRAPH_2:27;
consider g6 being (Function of X,( R^1 )) such that A13: (for p being (Point of X) holds (for r1,r0 being  real number holds ((( f2 . p ) = r1 & ( g5 . p ) = r0) implies ( g6 . p ) = ( r1 * r0 )))) and A14: g6 is  continuous by A2,A12,JGRAPH_2:25;
(for p being (Point of X) holds (for r1,r2 being Real holds ((( f1 . p ) = r1 & ( f2 . p ) = r2) implies ( g6 . p ) = ( r2 * ( ( ( r1 / r2 ) - a ) / b ) ))))
proof
let p being (Point of X);
let r1 being Real;
let r2 being Real;
assume that
A15: ( f1 . p ) = r1
and
A16: ( f2 . p ) = r2;
A17: ( g2 . p ) = a by A8;
set r8 = ( r1 / r2 );
A18: ( g1 . p ) = b by A7;
( g3 . p ) = r8 by A5,A15,A16;
then ( g4 . p ) = ( r8 - a ) by A9,A17;
then ( g5 . p ) = ( ( ( r1 / r2 ) - a ) / b ) by A11,A18;
