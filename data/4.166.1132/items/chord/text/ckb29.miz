theorem
(for G being _Graph holds (for P being (Path of G) holds (P is  open implies (for a,e,b being set holds ((((not a in ( P .vertices() )) & b = ( P .first() )) & e Joins a,b,G) implies ( ( G .walkOf (a,e,b) ) .append P ) is  Path-like)))))

let a being set,e being set,b being set;
assume that
