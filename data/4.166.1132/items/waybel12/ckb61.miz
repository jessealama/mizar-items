theorem
(for T being non empty TopSpace holds (T is  sober  locally-compact implies T is  Baire))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
assume that
A1: T is  sober  locally-compact;
let F being (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A2: F is  countable
and
A3: (for S being (Subset of T) holds (S in F implies S is  open  dense));
A4: F is  open
proof
let X being (Subset of T);
assume X in F;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
(for X being (Subset of T) holds (X in F implies X is  dense)) by A3;
then A5: F is  open  dense by A4,CKB3:def 1;
reconsider I = ( Intersect F ) as (Subset of T);
take I;
thus I = ( Intersect F );
per cases ;
suppose A6: F <> ( {} );

(for Q being (Subset of T) holds ((Q <> ( {} ) & Q is  open) implies ( Intersect F ) meets Q))
proof
let Q being (Subset of T);
assume that
A7: Q <> ( {} )
and
A8: Q is  open;
consider S being  irreducible (Subset of T) such that A9: (for V being (Subset of T) holds (V in F implies ( S /\ Q ) meets V)) by A1,A2,A5,A6,A7,A8,CKB59:1;
consider p being (Point of T) such that A10: p is_dense_point_of S and (for q being (Point of T) holds (q is_dense_point_of S implies p = q)) by A1,YELLOW_8:def 5;
S is  closed by YELLOW_8:def 3;
then A11: S = ( Cl { p } ) by A10,YELLOW_8:16;
A12: (for Y being set holds (Y in F implies (p in Y & p in Q)))
proof
let Y being set;
assume A13: Y in F;
then reconsider Y1 = Y as (Subset of T);
( S /\ Q ) meets Y1 by A9,A13;
then A14: ( ( S /\ Q ) /\ Y1 ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
now
assume (not p in ( Q /\ Y1 ));
then p in ( ( Q /\ Y1 ) ` ) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then { p } c= ( ( Q /\ Y1 ) ` ) by ZFMISC_1:31;
then A15: ( Cl { p } ) c= ( Cl ( ( Q /\ Y1 ) ` ) ) by PRE_TOPC:19;
Y1 is  open by A3,A13;
then ( Q /\ Y1 ) is  open by A8;
then ( ( Q /\ Y1 ) ` ) is  closed;
then S c= ( ( Q /\ Y1 ) ` ) by A11,A15,PRE_TOPC:22;
then S misses ( Q /\ Y1 ) by SUBSET_1:23;
then ( S /\ ( Q /\ Y1 ) ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
hence contradiction by A14,XBOOLE_1:16;
end;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
then (for Y being set holds (Y in F implies p in Y));
then A16: p in ( Intersect F ) by SETFAM_1:43;
(ex Y being set st Y in F) by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 1;
then p in Q by A12;
then ( ( Intersect F ) /\ Q ) <> ( {} ) by A16,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
end;
hence thesis by TOPS_1:45;
end;
suppose F = ( {} );

then ( Intersect F ) = ( [#] T ) by SETFAM_1:def 9;
hence thesis;
end;
end;
