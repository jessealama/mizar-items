theorem
Th47: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (T is  locally-compact implies (for D being  countable (Subset-Family of T) holds (D is non  empty  dense  open implies (for O being non  empty (Subset of T) holds (O is  open implies (ex A being  irreducible (Subset of T) st (for V being (Subset of T) holds (V in D implies ( A /\ O ) meets V)))))))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
assume T is  locally-compact;
then reconsider L = ( InclPoset (the topology of T) ) as  bounded  continuous LATTICE by WAYBEL_3:42;
A1: (the carrier of L) = (the topology of T) by YELLOW_1:1;
let D being  countable (Subset-Family of T);
assume that
A2: D is non  empty  dense  open;
consider I being set such that A3: I in D by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 1;
reconsider I as (Subset of T) by A3;
I is  open by A2,A3,TOPS_2:def 1;
then reconsider i = I as (Element of L) by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
set D1 = { d where d is (Element of L): (ex d1 being (Subset of T) st ((d1 in D & d1 = d) & d is  dense)) };
D1 c= (the carrier of L)
proof
let q being set;
assume q in D1;
then (ex d being (Element of L) st (q = d & (ex d1 being (Subset of T) st ((d1 in D & d1 = d) & d is  dense))));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider D1 as (Subset of L);
A4: D1 c= D
proof
let q being set;
assume q in D1;
then (ex d being (Element of L) st (q = d & (ex d1 being (Subset of T) st ((d1 in D & d1 = d) & d is  dense))));
hence thesis;
end;
A5: D1 is  dense
proof
let q being (Element of L);
assume q in D1;
then (ex d being (Element of L) st (q = d & (ex d1 being (Subset of T) st ((d1 in D & d1 = d) & d is  dense))));
hence thesis;
end;
let O being non  empty (Subset of T);
assume that
A6: O is  open;
reconsider u = O as (Element of L) by A6,A1,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
I is  open  dense by A2,A3,CKB3:def 1,TOPS_2:def 1;
then I is  everywhere_dense by TOPS_3:36;
then i is  dense by CKB58:1;
then (u <> ( Bottom L ) & i in D1) by A3,PRE_TOPC:1,YELLOW_1:13;
then consider p being  irreducible (Element of L) such that A7: p <> ( Top L ) and A8: (not p in ( uparrow ( { u } "/\" D1 ) )) by A4,A5,CKB55:1;
p in (the topology of T) by A1;
then reconsider P = p as (Subset of T);
reconsider A = ( P ` ) as  irreducible (Subset of T) by A7,CKB57:1;
take A;
let V being (Subset of T);
assume A9: V in D;
then A10: V is  open by A2,TOPS_2:def 1;
then reconsider v = V as (Element of L) by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
A11: (for d1 being (Element of L) holds (d1 in D1 implies (not ( u "/\" d1 ) <= p)))
proof
A12: u in { u } by TARSKI:def 1;
let d1 being (Element of L);
assume d1 in D1;
then ( u "/\" d1 ) in ( { u } "/\" D1 ) by A12;
hence thesis by A8,WAYBEL_0:def 16;
end;
V is  dense by A2,A9,CKB3:def 1;
then V is  everywhere_dense by A10,TOPS_3:36;
then v is  dense by CKB58:1;
then v in D1 by A9;
then (not ( u "/\" v ) <= p) by A11;
then A13: (not ( u "/\" v ) c= p) by YELLOW_1:3;
( O /\ V ) is  open by A6,A10;
then ( u /\ v ) in (the topology of T) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then (not ( O /\ V ) c= p) by A13,YELLOW_1:9;
then consider x being set such that A14: x in ( O /\ V ) and A15: (not x in ( A ` )) by TARSKI:def 3;
reconsider x as (Element of T) by A14;
x in A by A15,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then ( ( O /\ V ) /\ A ) <> ( {} ) by A14,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence ( ( A /\ O ) /\ V ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_1:16;
end;
