theorem
Th16: (for L being  algebraic  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice holds (for f being (Function of L,( InclPoset ( Ids ( CompactSublatt L ) ) )) holds ((for x being (Element of L) holds ( f . x ) = ( compactbelow x )) implies f is  isomorphic)))
proof
let L being  algebraic  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice;
let f being (Function of L,( InclPoset ( Ids ( CompactSublatt L ) ) ));
assume A1: (for x being (Element of L) holds ( f . x ) = ( compactbelow x ));
A2:now
let x being (Element of L),y being (Element of L);
thus (x <= y implies ( f . x ) <= ( f . y ))
proof
assume x <= y;
then ( compactbelow x ) c= ( compactbelow y ) by CKB1:1;
then ( f . x ) c= ( compactbelow y ) by A1;
then ( f . x ) c= ( f . y ) by A1;
hence thesis by YELLOW_1:3;
end;

thus (( f . x ) <= ( f . y ) implies x <= y)
proof
assume ( f . x ) <= ( f . y );
then ( f . x ) c= ( f . y ) by YELLOW_1:3;
then ( f . x ) c= ( compactbelow y ) by A1;
then A3: ( compactbelow x ) c= ( compactbelow y ) by A1;
( ex_sup_of ( compactbelow x ),L &  ex_sup_of ( compactbelow y ),L) by YELLOW_0:17;
then ( sup ( compactbelow x ) ) <= ( sup ( compactbelow y ) ) by A3,YELLOW_0:34;
then ( sup ( compactbelow x ) ) <= y by WAYBEL_8:def 3;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_8:def 3;
end;

end;
now
let y being set;
assume y in (the carrier of ( InclPoset ( Ids ( CompactSublatt L ) ) ));
then reconsider y9 = y as (Ideal of ( CompactSublatt L )) by YELLOW_2:41;
reconsider y1 = y9 as non empty (Subset of L) by CKB3:1;
reconsider y1 as non empty  directed (Subset of L) by YELLOW_2:7;
set x = ( sup y1 );
reconsider x9 = x as set;
take x9;
thus x9 in (the carrier of L);
A4: ( compactbelow x ) c= y9
proof
let d being set;
assume d in ( compactbelow x );
then d in { v where v is (Element of L): (x >= v & v is  compact) } by WAYBEL_8:def 2;
then consider d1 being (Element of L) such that A5: d1 = d and A6: d1 <= x and A7: d1 is  compact;
reconsider d9 = d1 as (Element of ( CompactSublatt L )) by A7,WAYBEL_8:def 1;
d1 << d1 by A7,WAYBEL_3:def 2;
then consider z being (Element of L) such that A8: z in y1 and A9: d1 <= z by A6,WAYBEL_3:def 1;
reconsider z9 = z as (Element of ( CompactSublatt L )) by A8;
d9 <= z9 by A9,YELLOW_0:60;
hence thesis by A5,A8,WAYBEL_0:def 19;
end;
y9 c= ( compactbelow x )
proof
let d being set;
assume A10: d in y9;
then reconsider d1 = d as (Element of ( CompactSublatt L ));
reconsider d9 = d1 as (Element of L) by YELLOW_0:58;
y9 is_<=_than ( sup y1 ) by YELLOW_0:32;
then (d9 is  compact & d9 <= x) by A10,LATTICE3:def 9,WAYBEL_8:def 1;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_8:4;
end;
hence y = ( compactbelow x ) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10
.= ( f . x9 ) by A1;
end;
then A11: ( rng f ) = (the carrier of ( InclPoset ( Ids ( CompactSublatt L ) ) )) by FUNCT_2:10;
now
let x being (Element of L),y being (Element of L);
assume ( f . x ) = ( f . y );
then ( f . x ) = ( compactbelow y ) by A1;
then ( compactbelow x ) = ( compactbelow y ) by A1;
then ( sup ( compactbelow x ) ) = y by WAYBEL_8:def 3;
hence x = y by WAYBEL_8:def 3;
end;
then f is  one-to-one by WAYBEL_1:def 1;
hence thesis by A11,A2,WAYBEL_0:66;
end;
