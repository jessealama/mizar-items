theorem
Th5: (for L1 being  lower-bounded non empty  reflexive  antisymmetric RelStr holds (for L2 being non empty  reflexive  antisymmetric RelStr holds ((( the RelStr of L1 ) = ( the RelStr of L2 ) & L1 is  up-complete) implies (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L1 )) = (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L2 )))))
proof
let L1 being  lower-bounded non empty  reflexive  antisymmetric RelStr;
let L2 being non empty  reflexive  antisymmetric RelStr;
assume that
A1: ( the RelStr of L1 ) = ( the RelStr of L2 )
and
A2: L1 is  up-complete;
now
reconsider L29 = L2 as  lower-bounded non empty  reflexive  antisymmetric RelStr by A1,YELLOW_0:13;
let x being set;
assume A3: x in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L2 ));
then x is (Element of ( CompactSublatt L29 ));
then reconsider x2 = x as (Element of L2) by YELLOW_0:58;
reconsider x1 = x2 as (Element of L1) by A1;
A4: x2 is  compact by A3,WAYBEL_8:def 1;
L2 is  up-complete by A1,A2,WAYBEL_8:15;
then x1 is  compact by A1,A4,WAYBEL_8:9;
hence x in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L1 )) by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
end;
then A5: (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L2 )) c= (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L1 )) by TARSKI:def 3;
now
let x being set;
assume A6: x in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L1 ));
then reconsider x1 = x as (Element of L1) by YELLOW_0:58;
reconsider x2 = x1 as (Element of L2) by A1;
x1 is  compact by A6,WAYBEL_8:def 1;
then x2 is  compact by A1,A2,WAYBEL_8:9;
hence x in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L2 )) by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
end;
then (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L1 )) c= (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L2 )) by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
