theorem
Lm1: (for L being  lower-bounded LATTICE holds (L is  algebraic implies (ex X being non empty set st (ex S being  full (SubRelStr of ( BoolePoset X )) st ((S is  infs-inheriting & S is  directed-sups-inheriting) & L,S are_isomorphic )))))
proof
let L being  lower-bounded LATTICE;
assume A1: L is  algebraic;
then reconsider L9 = L as  algebraic  lower-bounded LATTICE;
take X = (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L ));
consider g being (Function of L,( BoolePoset (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) )) such that A2: g is  infs-preserving and A3: g is  directed-sups-preserving and A4: g is  one-to-one and A5: (for x being (Element of L) holds ( g . x ) = ( compactbelow x )) by A1,CKB26:1;
reconsider S = ( Image g ) as non empty  full (SubRelStr of ( BoolePoset X ));
take S;
A6: L9 is  complete;
hence S is  infs-inheriting by A2,YELLOW_2:33;
A7: ( rng g ) = (the carrier of S) by YELLOW_0:def 15;
( dom g ) = (the carrier of L) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then reconsider g1 = g as (Function of L,S) by A7,FUNCT_2:1;
now
let x being (Element of L),y being (Element of L);
thus (x <= y implies ( g1 . x ) <= ( g1 . y ))
proof
assume x <= y;
then ( compactbelow x ) c= ( compactbelow y ) by CKB1:1;
then ( g . x ) c= ( compactbelow y ) by A5;
then ( g . x ) c= ( g . y ) by A5;
then ( g . x ) <= ( g . y ) by YELLOW_1:2;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:60;
end;

thus (( g1 . x ) <= ( g1 . y ) implies x <= y)
proof
assume ( g1 . x ) <= ( g1 . y );
then ( g . x ) <= ( g . y ) by YELLOW_0:59;
then ( g . x ) c= ( g . y ) by YELLOW_1:2;
then ( g . x ) c= ( compactbelow y ) by A5;
then A8: ( compactbelow x ) c= ( compactbelow y ) by A5;
( ex_sup_of ( compactbelow x ),L &  ex_sup_of ( compactbelow y ),L) by A6,YELLOW_0:17;
then ( sup ( compactbelow x ) ) <= ( sup ( compactbelow y ) ) by A8,YELLOW_0:34;
then x <= ( sup ( compactbelow y ) ) by A1,WAYBEL_8:def 3;
hence thesis by A1,WAYBEL_8:def 3;
end;

end;
then A9: g1 is  isomorphic by A4,A7,WAYBEL_0:66;
then reconsider f1 = ( g1 " ) as (Function of S,L) by WAYBEL_0:67;
A10: f1 is  isomorphic by A9,WAYBEL_0:68;
now
let Y being  directed (Subset of S);
assume that
A11: Y <> ( {} )
and
 ex_sup_of Y,( BoolePoset X );
now
let X2 being  finite (Subset of ( f1 .: Y ));
A12: ( g1 " ( g1 .: X2 ) ) c= X2 by A4,FUNCT_1:82;
now
let v being set;
assume v in ( g1 .: X2 );
then (ex u being set st ((u in ( dom g1 ) & u in X2) & v = ( g1 . u ))) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
then v in ( g1 .: ( f1 .: Y ) ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
then v in ( g1 .: ( g1 " Y ) ) by A4,FUNCT_1:85;
hence v in Y by A7,FUNCT_1:77;
end;
then reconsider Y1 = ( g1 .: X2 ) as  finite (Subset of Y) by TARSKI:def 3;
consider y1 being (Element of S) such that A13: y1 in Y and A14: y1 is_>=_than Y1 by A11,WAYBEL_0:1;
take f1y1 = ( f1 . y1 );
y1 in (the carrier of S);
then y1 in ( dom f1 ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence f1y1 in ( f1 .: Y ) by A13,FUNCT_1:def 6;
X2 c= (the carrier of L) by XBOOLE_1:1;
then X2 c= ( dom g1 ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A15: X2 c= ( g1 " ( g1 .: X2 ) ) by FUNCT_1:76;
( f1 .: Y1 ) = ( g1 " ( g1 .: X2 ) ) by A4,FUNCT_1:85
.= X2 by A15,A12,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence f1y1 is_>=_than X2 by A10,A14,CKB20:1;
end;
then reconsider X1 = ( f1 .: Y ) as non empty  directed (Subset of L) by WAYBEL_0:1;
( sup X1 ) in (the carrier of L);
then ( sup X1 ) in ( dom g ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;

( ex_sup_of X1,L & g preserves_sup_of X1) by A6,A3,WAYBEL_0:def 37,YELLOW_0:17;
then A17: ( sup ( g .: X1 ) ) in ( rng g ) by A16,WAYBEL_0:def 31;
( g .: X1 ) = ( g .: ( g1 " Y ) ) by A4,FUNCT_1:85
.= Y by A7,FUNCT_1:77;
hence ( "\/" (Y,( BoolePoset X )) ) in (the carrier of S) by A17,YELLOW_0:def 15;
end;
hence S is  directed-sups-inheriting by WAYBEL_0:def 4;
thus thesis by A9,WAYBEL_1:def 8;
