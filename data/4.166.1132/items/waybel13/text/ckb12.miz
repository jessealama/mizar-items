theorem
Th11: (for S being  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice holds (for x being (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids S ) )) holds (x is  compact iff x is  principal  principal (Ideal of S))))
proof
let S being  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice;
reconsider InIdS = ( InclPoset ( Ids S ) ) as (CLSubFrame of ( BoolePoset (the carrier of S) )) by CKB8:1;
let x being (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids S ) ));
reconsider x9 = x as (Ideal of S) by YELLOW_2:41;
thus (x is  compact implies x is  principal  principal (Ideal of S))
proof
assume x is  compact;
then x in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt InIdS )) by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
then consider F being (Element of ( BoolePoset (the carrier of S) )) such that A1: F is  finite and A2: x = ( meet { Y where Y is (Element of InIdS): F c= Y } ) and A3: F c= x by CKB7:1;
A4: F c= (the carrier of S) by WAYBEL_8:26;
(ex y being (Element of S) st (y in x9 & y is_>=_than x9))
proof
reconsider F9 = F as (Subset of S) by WAYBEL_8:26;
reconsider F9 as (Subset of S);
reconsider y = ( sup F9 ) as (Element of S);
take y;
now
per cases ;
suppose F9 <> ( {} );

hence y in x9 by A1,A3,WAYBEL_0:42;
end;
suppose F9 = ( {} );

then y = ( Bottom S ) by YELLOW_0:def 11;
hence y in x9 by WAYBEL_4:21;
end;
end;
hence y in x9;
now
now
let u being set;
assume A5: u in F;
then reconsider u9 = u as (Element of S) by A4;
 ex_sup_of F9,S by A1,A5,YELLOW_0:54;
then y is_>=_than F by YELLOW_0:30;
then u9 <= y by A5,LATTICE3:def 9;
hence u in ( downarrow y ) by WAYBEL_0:17;
end;
then A6: F c= ( downarrow y ) by TARSKI:def 3;
let b being (Element of S);
assume A7: b in x9;
( downarrow y ) is (Element of InIdS) by YELLOW_2:41;
then ( downarrow y ) in { Y where Y is (Element of InIdS): F c= Y } by A6;
then b in ( downarrow y ) by A2,A7,SETFAM_1:def 1;
hence b <= y by WAYBEL_0:17;
end;
hence thesis by LATTICE3:def 9;
end;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:def 21;
end;

thus (x is  principal  principal (Ideal of S) implies x is  compact)
proof
assume x is  principal  principal (Ideal of S);
then consider y being (Element of S) such that A8: y in x9 and A9: y is_>=_than x9 by WAYBEL_0:def 21;
(ex F being (Element of ( BoolePoset (the carrier of S) )) st ((F is  finite & F c= x) & x = ( meet { Y where Y is (Element of InIdS): F c= Y } )))
proof
reconsider F = { y } as (Element of ( BoolePoset (the carrier of S) )) by WAYBEL_8:26;
take F;
thus F is  finite;
(for v being set holds (v in F implies v in x)) by A8,TARSKI:def 1;
hence A10: F c= x by TARSKI:def 3;
A11:now
let z being set;
thus (z in x implies (for Z being set holds (Z in { Y where Y is (Element of InIdS): F c= Y } implies z in Z)))
proof
assume A12: z in x;
then reconsider z9 = z as (Element of S) by YELLOW_2:42;
A13: z9 <= y by A9,A12,LATTICE3:def 9;
let Z being set;
assume Z in { Y where Y is (Element of InIdS): F c= Y };
then consider Z1 being (Element of InIdS) such that A14: (Z1 = Z & F c= Z1);
(Z1 is (Ideal of S) & y in F) by TARSKI:def 1,YELLOW_2:41;
hence thesis by A14,A13,WAYBEL_0:def 19;
end;

thus ((for Z being set holds (Z in { Y where Y is (Element of InIdS): F c= Y } implies z in Z)) implies z in x)
proof
assume A15: (for Z being set holds (Z in { Y where Y is (Element of InIdS): F c= Y } implies z in Z));
x in { Y where Y is (Element of InIdS): F c= Y } by A10;
hence thesis by A15;
end;

end;
( [#] S ) is (Element of InIdS) by YELLOW_2:41;
then ( [#] S ) in { Y where Y is (Element of InIdS): F c= Y };
hence thesis by A11,SETFAM_1:def 1;
end;
then x in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt InIdS )) by CKB7:1;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
end;
