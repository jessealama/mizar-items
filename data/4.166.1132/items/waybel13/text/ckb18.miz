theorem
(for L being  algebraic  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice holds (for x being (Element of L) holds (( compactbelow x ) is  principal  principal (Ideal of ( CompactSublatt L )) iff x is  compact)))
proof
let L being  algebraic  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice;
let x being (Element of L);
thus (( compactbelow x ) is  principal  principal (Ideal of ( CompactSublatt L )) implies x is  compact)
proof
assume ( compactbelow x ) is  principal  principal (Ideal of ( CompactSublatt L ));
then consider y being (Element of ( CompactSublatt L )) such that A1: y in ( compactbelow x ) and A2: y is_>=_than ( compactbelow x ) by WAYBEL_0:def 21;
reconsider y9 = y as (Element of L) by YELLOW_0:58;
( compactbelow x ) is (Subset of ( CompactSublatt L )) by CKB2:1;
then y9 is_>=_than ( compactbelow x ) by A2,YELLOW_0:62;
then y9 >= ( sup ( compactbelow x ) ) by YELLOW_0:32;
then A3: x <= y9 by WAYBEL_8:def 3;
(y9 <= x & y9 is  compact) by A1,WAYBEL_8:4;
hence thesis by A3,ORDERS_2:2;
end;

thus (x is  compact implies ( compactbelow x ) is  principal  principal (Ideal of ( CompactSublatt L )))
proof
reconsider I = ( compactbelow x ) as non  empty (Subset of ( CompactSublatt L )) by CKB2:1;
assume A4: x is  compact;
then reconsider x9 = x as (Element of ( CompactSublatt L )) by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
( compactbelow x ) is non  empty  directed non  empty  directed (Subset of L) by WAYBEL_8:def 4;
then reconsider I as non  empty  directed (Subset of ( CompactSublatt L )) by WAYBEL10:23;
now
let y being (Element of ( CompactSublatt L ));
let z being (Element of ( CompactSublatt L ));
reconsider y9 = y,z9 = z as (Element of L) by YELLOW_0:58;
assume (y in I & z <= y);
then (y9 <= x & z9 <= y9) by WAYBEL_8:4,YELLOW_0:59;
then A5: z9 <= x by ORDERS_2:3;
z9 is  compact by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
hence z in I by A5,WAYBEL_8:4;
end;
then reconsider I as (Ideal of ( CompactSublatt L )) by WAYBEL_0:def 19;
( sup ( compactbelow x ) ) is_>=_than ( compactbelow x ) by YELLOW_0:32;
then x is_>=_than I by WAYBEL_8:def 3;
then A6: x9 is_>=_than I by YELLOW_0:61;
x <= x;
then x9 in I by A4,WAYBEL_8:4;
hence thesis by A6,WAYBEL_0:def 21;
end;
