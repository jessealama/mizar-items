theorem
Th29: (for L1,L2 being  up-complete non empty Poset holds (for f being (Function of L1,L2) holds (f is  isomorphic implies (for x being (Element of L1) holds ( f .: ( compactbelow x ) ) = ( compactbelow ( f . x ) )))))
proof
let L1 being  up-complete non empty Poset,L2 being  up-complete non empty Poset;
let f being (Function of L1,L2);
assume A1: f is  isomorphic;
then reconsider g = ( f " ) as (Function of L2,L1) by WAYBEL_0:67;
let x being (Element of L1);
A2: g is  isomorphic by A1,WAYBEL_0:68;
A3: ( compactbelow ( f . x ) ) c= ( f .: ( compactbelow x ) )
proof
let z being set;
x in (the carrier of L1);
then A4: x in ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
assume z in ( compactbelow ( f . x ) );
then z in { y where y is (Element of L2): (( f . x ) >= y & y is  compact) } by WAYBEL_8:def 2;
then consider z1 being (Element of L2) such that A5: z1 = z and A6: ( f . x ) >= z1 and A7: z1 is  compact;
A8: ( g . z1 ) is  compact by A2,A7,CKB34:1;
( g . z1 ) <= ( g . ( f . x ) ) by A2,A6,WAYBEL_0:66;
then ( g . z1 ) <= x by A1,A4,FUNCT_1:34;
then A9: ( g . z1 ) in ( compactbelow x ) by A8,WAYBEL_8:4;
z1 in (the carrier of L2);
then A10: z1 in ( rng f ) by A1,WAYBEL_0:66;
( g . z1 ) in (the carrier of L1);
then ( g . z1 ) in ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( f . ( g . z1 ) ) in ( f .: ( compactbelow x ) ) by A9,FUNCT_1:def 6;
hence thesis by A1,A5,A10,FUNCT_1:35;
end;
( f .: ( compactbelow x ) ) c= ( compactbelow ( f . x ) )
proof
let z being set;
assume z in ( f .: ( compactbelow x ) );
then consider u being set such that u in ( dom f ) and A11: u in ( compactbelow x ) and A12: z = ( f . u ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
u in { y where y is (Element of L1): (x >= y & y is  compact) } by A11,WAYBEL_8:def 2;
then consider u1 being (Element of L1) such that A13: u1 = u and A14: (x >= u1 & u1 is  compact);
(( f . u1 ) <= ( f . x ) & ( f . u1 ) is  compact) by A1,A14,CKB34:1,WAYBEL_0:66;
hence thesis by A12,A13,WAYBEL_8:4;
end;
hence thesis by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
