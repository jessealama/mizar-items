theorem
(for L being  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice holds (for f being (Function of L,( CompactSublatt ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) ) )) holds ((for x being (Element of L) holds ( f . x ) = ( downarrow x )) implies f is  isomorphic)))
proof
let L being  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice;
let f being (Function of L,( CompactSublatt ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) ) ));
assume A1: (for x being (Element of L) holds ( f . x ) = ( downarrow x ));
A2: (for x,y being (Element of L) holds (x <= y iff ( f . x ) <= ( f . y )))
proof
let x being (Element of L),y being (Element of L);
reconsider fx = ( f . x ) as (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) )) by YELLOW_0:58;
reconsider fy = ( f . y ) as (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) )) by YELLOW_0:58;
thus (x <= y implies ( f . x ) <= ( f . y ))
proof
assume x <= y;
then ( downarrow x ) c= ( downarrow y ) by WAYBEL_0:21;
then ( f . x ) c= ( downarrow y ) by A1;
then fx c= fy by A1;
then fx <= fy by YELLOW_1:3;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:60;
end;

x <= x;
then A3: x in ( downarrow x ) by WAYBEL_0:17;
thus (( f . x ) <= ( f . y ) implies x <= y)
proof
assume ( f . x ) <= ( f . y );
then fx <= fy by YELLOW_0:59;
then fx c= fy by YELLOW_1:3;
then ( f . x ) c= ( downarrow y ) by A1;
then ( downarrow x ) c= ( downarrow y ) by A1;
hence thesis by A3,WAYBEL_0:17;
end;

end;
now
let y being set;
assume A4: y in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) ) ));
(the carrier of ( CompactSublatt ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) ) )) c= (the carrier of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) )) by YELLOW_0:def 13;
then reconsider y9 = y as (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) )) by A4;
y9 is  compact by A4,WAYBEL_8:def 1;
then consider x being (Element of L) such that A5: y9 = ( downarrow x ) by CKB13:1;
reconsider x9 = x as set;
take x9;
thus x9 in (the carrier of L);
thus y = ( f . x9 ) by A1,A5;
end;
then A6: ( rng f ) = (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) ) )) by FUNCT_2:10;
now
let x being (Element of L),y being (Element of L);
assume ( f . x ) = ( f . y );
then ( f . x ) = ( downarrow y ) by A1;
then ( downarrow x ) = ( downarrow y ) by A1;
hence x = y by WAYBEL_0:19;
end;
then f is  one-to-one by WAYBEL_1:def 1;
hence thesis by A6,A2,WAYBEL_0:66;
end;
