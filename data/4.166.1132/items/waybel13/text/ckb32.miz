theorem
Lm4: (for L1,L2 being  up-complete non empty Poset holds (for f being (Function of L1,L2) holds (f is  isomorphic implies (for x,y being (Element of L1) holds (x << y implies ( f . x ) << ( f . y ))))))
proof
let L1 being  up-complete non empty Poset,L2 being  up-complete non empty Poset;
let f being (Function of L1,L2);
assume A1: f is  isomorphic;
then reconsider g = ( f " ) as (Function of L2,L1) by WAYBEL_0:67;
let x being (Element of L1),y being (Element of L1);
A2: g is  isomorphic by A1,WAYBEL_0:68;
assume A3: x << y;
now
let X being non empty  directed (Subset of L2);
y in (the carrier of L1);
then A4: y in ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
X c= (the carrier of L2);
then A5: X c= ( rng f ) by A1,WAYBEL_0:66;
now
let Y1 being  finite (Subset of ( g .: X ));
A6: ( f " ( f .: Y1 ) ) c= Y1 by A1,FUNCT_1:82;
now
let v being set;
assume v in ( f .: Y1 );
then (ex u being set st ((u in ( dom f ) & u in Y1) & v = ( f . u ))) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
then v in ( f .: ( g .: X ) ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
then v in ( f .: ( f " X ) ) by A1,FUNCT_1:85;
hence v in X by A5,FUNCT_1:77;
end;
then reconsider X1 = ( f .: Y1 ) as  finite (Subset of X) by TARSKI:def 3;
consider y1 being (Element of L2) such that A7: y1 in X and A8: y1 is_>=_than X1 by WAYBEL_0:1;
take gy1 = ( g . y1 );
y1 in (the carrier of L2);
then y1 in ( dom g ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence gy1 in ( g .: X ) by A7,FUNCT_1:def 6;
Y1 c= (the carrier of L1) by XBOOLE_1:1;
then Y1 c= ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A9: Y1 c= ( f " ( f .: Y1 ) ) by FUNCT_1:76;
( g .: X1 ) = ( f " ( f .: Y1 ) ) by A1,FUNCT_1:85
.= Y1 by A9,A6,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence gy1 is_>=_than Y1 by A2,A8,CKB20:1;
end;
then reconsider Y = ( g .: X ) as non empty  directed (Subset of L1) by WAYBEL_0:1;
A10: ( ex_sup_of X,L2 & g preserves_sup_of X) by A2,WAYBEL_0:75,WAYBEL_0:def 33;
assume ( f . y ) <= ( sup X );
then ( g . ( f . y ) ) <= ( g . ( sup X ) ) by A2,WAYBEL_0:66;
then y <= ( g . ( sup X ) ) by A1,A4,FUNCT_1:34;
then y <= ( sup Y ) by A10,WAYBEL_0:def 31;
then consider c being (Element of L1) such that A11: c in Y and A12: x <= c by A3,WAYBEL_3:def 1;
take fc = ( f . c );
c in (the carrier of L1);
then c in ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( f . c ) in ( f .: Y ) by A11,FUNCT_1:def 6;
then ( f . c ) in ( f .: ( f " X ) ) by A1,FUNCT_1:85;
hence fc in X by A5,FUNCT_1:77;
thus ( f . x ) <= fc by A1,A12,WAYBEL_0:66;
end;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_3:def 1;
