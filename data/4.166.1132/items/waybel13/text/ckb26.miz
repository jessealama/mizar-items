theorem
Th24: (for L being  algebraic  lower-bounded LATTICE holds (ex g being (Function of L,( BoolePoset (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) )) st (((g is  infs-preserving & g is  directed-sups-preserving) & g is  one-to-one) & (for x being (Element of L) holds ( g . x ) = ( compactbelow x )))))
proof
let L being  algebraic  lower-bounded LATTICE;
deffunc F((Element of L)) = ( compactbelow $1 );
A1: (for y being (Element of L) holds F(y) is (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids ( CompactSublatt L ) ) )))
proof
let y being (Element of L);
reconsider comy = ( compactbelow y ) as non  empty  directed (Subset of L) by WAYBEL_8:def 4;
reconsider comy as non  empty (Subset of ( CompactSublatt L )) by CKB2:1;
reconsider comy as non  empty  directed (Subset of ( CompactSublatt L )) by WAYBEL10:23;
now
let x1 being (Element of ( CompactSublatt L ));
let z1 being (Element of ( CompactSublatt L ));
reconsider x2 = x1,z2 = z1 as (Element of L) by YELLOW_0:58;
assume (x1 in comy & z1 <= x1);
then (x2 <= y & z2 <= x2) by WAYBEL_8:4,YELLOW_0:59;
then A2: z2 <= y by ORDERS_2:3;
z2 is  compact by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
hence z1 in comy by A2,WAYBEL_8:4;
end;
then comy is  lower by WAYBEL_0:def 19;
hence thesis by YELLOW_2:41;
end;
consider g1 being (Function of L,( InclPoset ( Ids ( CompactSublatt L ) ) )) such that A3: (for y being (Element of L) holds ( g1 . y ) = F(y)) from FUNCT_2:sch 9(A1);
now
let k being set;
assume k in (the carrier of ( InclPoset ( Ids ( CompactSublatt L ) ) ));
then k is (Ideal of ( CompactSublatt L )) by YELLOW_2:41;
then k is (Element of ( BoolePoset (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) )) by WAYBEL_8:26;
hence k in (the carrier of ( BoolePoset (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) ));
end;
then (the carrier of ( InclPoset ( Ids ( CompactSublatt L ) ) )) c= (the carrier of ( BoolePoset (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) )) by TARSKI:def 3;
then reconsider g = g1 as (Function of L,( BoolePoset (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) )) by FUNCT_2:7;
take g;
A4: g1 is  isomorphic by A3,CKB17:1;
A5: ( InclPoset ( Ids ( CompactSublatt L ) ) ) is  full  infs-inheriting  directed-sups-inheriting  full  infs-inheriting  directed-sups-inheriting (SubRelStr of ( BoolePoset (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) )) by CKB25:1;
then (ex g2 being (Function of L,( BoolePoset (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) )) st (g1 = g2 & g2 is  infs-preserving)) by A4,CKB23:1;
hence g is  infs-preserving;
(ex g3 being (Function of L,( BoolePoset (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) )) st (g1 = g3 & g3 is  directed-sups-preserving)) by A4,A5,CKB24:1;
hence g is  directed-sups-preserving;
thus g is  one-to-one by A4;
let x being (Element of L);
thus thesis by A3;
end;
