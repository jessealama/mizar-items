theorem
Th9: (for L being  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice holds (for X being non empty  directed (Subset of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) )) holds ( sup X ) = ( union X )))
proof
let L being  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice;
let X being non empty  directed (Subset of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) ));
consider z being set such that A1: z in X by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
X c= (the carrier of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) ));
then A2: X c= ( Ids L ) by YELLOW_1:1;
now
let x being set;
assume x in X;
then x in ( Ids L ) by A2;
then x in { Y where Y is (Ideal of L): (not contradiction) } by WAYBEL_0:def 23;
then (ex x1 being (Ideal of L) st x = x1);
hence x in ( bool (the carrier of L) );
end;
then A3: X c= ( bool (the carrier of L) ) by TARSKI:def 3;
now
let Z being (Subset of L);
assume Z in X;
then Z in ( Ids L ) by A2;
then Z in { Y where Y is (Ideal of L): (not contradiction) } by WAYBEL_0:def 23;
then (ex Z1 being (Ideal of L) st Z = Z1);
hence Z is  lower;
end;
then reconsider unX = ( union X ) as  lower (Subset of L) by A3,WAYBEL_0:26;
z in ( Ids L ) by A2,A1;
then z in { Y where Y is (Ideal of L): (not contradiction) } by WAYBEL_0:def 23;
then (ex z1 being (Ideal of L) st z = z1);
then (ex v being set st v in z) by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
then reconsider unX as  lower non empty (Subset of L) by A1,TARSKI:def 4;
A4:now
let V being (Subset of L),Y being (Subset of L);
assume A5: (V in X & Y in X);
then reconsider V1 = V,Y1 = Y as (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) ));
consider Z1 being (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) )) such that A6: Z1 in X and A7: (V1 <= Z1 & Y1 <= Z1) by A5,WAYBEL_0:def 1;
Z1 in ( Ids L ) by A2,A6;
then Z1 in { Y9 where Y9 is (Ideal of L): (not contradiction) } by WAYBEL_0:def 23;
then (ex Z2 being (Ideal of L) st Z1 = Z2);
then reconsider Z = Z1 as (Subset of L);
take Z;
thus Z in X by A6;
(V c= Z & Y c= Z) by A7,YELLOW_1:3;
hence ( V \/ Y ) c= Z by XBOOLE_1:8;
end;
now
let Z being (Subset of L);
assume Z in X;
then Z in ( Ids L ) by A2;
then Z in { Y where Y is (Ideal of L): (not contradiction) } by WAYBEL_0:def 23;
then (ex Z1 being (Ideal of L) st Z = Z1);
hence Z is  directed;
end;
then reconsider unX as  directed  lower non empty (Subset of L) by A3,A4,WAYBEL_0:46;
reconsider unX as (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) )) by YELLOW_2:41;
now
let Y being set;
assume A8: Y in X;
then reconsider Y9 = Y as (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) ));
( sup X ) is_>=_than X by YELLOW_0:32;
then Y9 <= ( sup X ) by A8,LATTICE3:def 9;
hence Y c= ( sup X ) by YELLOW_1:3;
end;
then ( union X ) c= ( sup X ) by ZFMISC_1:76;
then A9: unX <= ( sup X ) by YELLOW_1:3;
now
let b being (Element of ( InclPoset ( Ids L ) ));
assume b in X;
then b c= ( union X ) by ZFMISC_1:74;
hence b <= unX by YELLOW_1:3;
end;
then unX is_>=_than X by LATTICE3:def 9;
then ( sup X ) <= unX by YELLOW_0:32;
hence thesis by A9,ORDERS_2:2;
end;
