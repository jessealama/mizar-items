theorem
Th20: (for L1,L2 being non  empty  antisymmetric RelStr holds (for f being (Function of L1,L2) holds (f is  isomorphic implies f is  infs-preserving  sups-preserving)))
proof
let L1 being non  empty  antisymmetric RelStr;
let L2 being non  empty  antisymmetric RelStr;
let f being (Function of L1,L2);
assume A1: f is  isomorphic;
then A2: ( rng f ) = (the carrier of L2) by WAYBEL_0:66;
now
let X being (Subset of L1);
now
assume A3:  ex_inf_of X,L1;
then consider a being (Element of L1) such that A4: X is_>=_than a and A5: (for b being (Element of L1) holds (X is_>=_than b implies a >= b)) by YELLOW_0:16;
A6:now
let c being (Element of L2);
consider e being set such that A7: e in ( dom f ) and A8: c = ( f . e ) by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider e as (Element of L1) by A7;
assume ( f .: X ) is_>=_than c;
then X is_>=_than e by A1,A8,CKB19:1;
then a >= e by A5;
hence ( f . a ) >= c by A1,A8,WAYBEL_0:66;
end;
( f .: X ) is_>=_than ( f . a ) by A1,A4,CKB19:1;
hence  ex_inf_of ( f .: X ),L2 by A6,YELLOW_0:16;
A9:now
let b being (Element of L2);
consider v being set such that A10: v in ( dom f ) and A11: b = ( f . v ) by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider v as (Element of L1) by A10;
assume b is_<=_than ( f .: X );
then v is_<=_than X by A1,A11,CKB19:1;
then ( inf X ) >= v by A3,YELLOW_0:31;
hence ( f . ( inf X ) ) >= b by A1,A11,WAYBEL_0:66;
end;
( inf X ) is_<=_than X by A3,YELLOW_0:31;
then ( f . ( inf X ) ) is_<=_than ( f .: X ) by A1,CKB19:1;
hence ( inf ( f .: X ) ) = ( f . ( inf X ) ) by A9,YELLOW_0:31;
end;
hence f preserves_inf_of X by WAYBEL_0:def 30;
end;
hence f is  infs-preserving by WAYBEL_0:def 32;
now
let X being (Subset of L1);
now
assume A12:  ex_sup_of X,L1;
then consider a being (Element of L1) such that A13: X is_<=_than a and A14: (for b being (Element of L1) holds (X is_<=_than b implies a <= b)) by YELLOW_0:15;
A15:now
let c being (Element of L2);
consider e being set such that A16: e in ( dom f ) and A17: c = ( f . e ) by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider e as (Element of L1) by A16;
assume ( f .: X ) is_<=_than c;
then X is_<=_than e by A1,A17,CKB20:1;
then a <= e by A14;
hence ( f . a ) <= c by A1,A17,WAYBEL_0:66;
end;
( f .: X ) is_<=_than ( f . a ) by A1,A13,CKB20:1;
hence  ex_sup_of ( f .: X ),L2 by A15,YELLOW_0:15;
A18:now
let b being (Element of L2);
consider v being set such that A19: v in ( dom f ) and A20: b = ( f . v ) by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider v as (Element of L1) by A19;
assume b is_>=_than ( f .: X );
then v is_>=_than X by A1,A20,CKB20:1;
then ( sup X ) <= v by A12,YELLOW_0:30;
hence ( f . ( sup X ) ) <= b by A1,A20,WAYBEL_0:66;
end;
( sup X ) is_>=_than X by A12,YELLOW_0:30;
then ( f . ( sup X ) ) is_>=_than ( f .: X ) by A1,CKB20:1;
hence ( sup ( f .: X ) ) = ( f . ( sup X ) ) by A18,YELLOW_0:30;
end;
hence f preserves_sup_of X by WAYBEL_0:def 31;
end;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:def 33;
end;
