theorem
Th10: (for S being  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice holds ( InclPoset ( Ids S ) ) is  algebraic)
proof
let S being  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice;
set BS = ( BoolePoset (the carrier of S) );
( Ids S ) c= ( bool (the carrier of S) )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( Ids S );
then x in { X where X is (Ideal of S): (not contradiction) } by WAYBEL_0:def 23;
then (ex x1 being (Ideal of S) st x = x1);
hence thesis;

now

then X c= (the carrier of BS) by TARSKI:def 3;
then ( "/\" (X,BS) ) = ( meet X ) by A2,YELLOW_1:20
