theorem
Th32: (for L1,L2 being sup-Semilattice holds ((L1,L2 are_isomorphic  & L1 is  lower-bounded  algebraic) implies L2 is  algebraic))
proof
let L1 being sup-Semilattice,L2 being sup-Semilattice;
assume that
A1: L1,L2 are_isomorphic 
and
A2: L1 is  lower-bounded  algebraic;
consider f being (Function of L1,L2) such that A3: f is  isomorphic by A1,WAYBEL_1:def 8;
reconsider g = ( f " ) as (Function of L2,L1) by A3,WAYBEL_0:67;
A4: g is  isomorphic by A3,WAYBEL_0:68;
A5:now
let y being (Element of L2);
y in (the carrier of L2);
then y in ( dom g ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A6: y in ( rng f ) by A3,FUNCT_1:33;
A7: L2 is  up-complete non empty  up-complete non empty Poset by A1,A2,CKB36:1;
A8: ( compactbelow ( g . y ) ) is non empty  directed by A2,WAYBEL_8:def 4;
now
let Y being  finite (Subset of ( compactbelow ( f . ( g . y ) ) ));
Y c= (the carrier of L2) by XBOOLE_1:1;
then A9: Y c= ( rng f ) by A3,WAYBEL_0:66;
now
let z being set;
assume z in ( g .: Y );
then consider v being set such that A10: v in ( dom g ) and A11: v in Y and A12: z = ( g . v ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
reconsider v as (Element of L2) by A10;
v in ( compactbelow ( f . ( g . y ) ) ) by A11;
then v in ( compactbelow y ) by A3,A6,FUNCT_1:35;
then v <= y by WAYBEL_8:4;
then A13: ( g . v ) <= ( g . y ) by A4,WAYBEL_0:66;
v is  compact by A11,WAYBEL_8:4;
then ( g . v ) is  compact by A2,A4,A7,CKB34:1;
hence z in ( compactbelow ( g . y ) ) by A12,A13,WAYBEL_8:4;
end;
then reconsider X = ( g .: Y ) as  finite (Subset of ( compactbelow ( g . y ) )) by TARSKI:def 3;
consider x being (Element of L1) such that A14: x in ( compactbelow ( g . y ) ) and A15: x is_>=_than X by A8,WAYBEL_0:1;
take fx = ( f . x );
x <= ( g . y ) by A14,WAYBEL_8:4;
then A16: ( f . x ) <= ( f . ( g . y ) ) by A3,WAYBEL_0:66;
x is  compact by A14,WAYBEL_8:4;
then ( f . x ) is  compact by A2,A3,A7,CKB34:1;
hence fx in ( compactbelow ( f . ( g . y ) ) ) by A16,WAYBEL_8:4;
( f .: X ) = ( f .: ( f " Y ) ) by A3,FUNCT_1:85
.= Y by A9,FUNCT_1:77;
hence fx is_>=_than Y by A3,A15,CKB20:1;
end;
then ( compactbelow ( f . ( g . y ) ) ) is non empty  directed by WAYBEL_0:1;
hence ( compactbelow y ) is non empty  directed by A3,A6,FUNCT_1:35;
end;
(L2 is  up-complete & L2 is  satisfying_axiom_K) by A1,A2,CKB36:1,CKB37:1;
hence thesis by A5,WAYBEL_8:def 4;
end;
