theorem
Th30: (for L1,L2 being non empty Poset holds ((L1,L2 are_isomorphic  & L1 is  up-complete) implies L2 is  up-complete))
proof
let L1 being non empty Poset,L2 being non empty Poset;
assume that
A1: L1,L2 are_isomorphic 
and
A2: L1 is  up-complete;
consider f being (Function of L1,L2) such that A3: f is  isomorphic by A1,WAYBEL_1:def 8;
reconsider g = ( f " ) as (Function of L2,L1) by A3,WAYBEL_0:67;
A4: g is  isomorphic by A3,WAYBEL_0:68;
now
let Y being non empty  directed (Subset of L2);
Y c= (the carrier of L2);
then A5: Y c= ( rng f ) by A3,WAYBEL_0:66;
now
let X1 being  finite (Subset of ( g .: Y ));
A6: ( f " ( f .: X1 ) ) c= X1 by A3,FUNCT_1:82;
now
let v being set;
assume v in ( f .: X1 );
then (ex u being set st ((u in ( dom f ) & u in X1) & v = ( f . u ))) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
then v in ( f .: ( g .: Y ) ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
then v in ( f .: ( f " Y ) ) by A3,FUNCT_1:85;
hence v in Y by A5,FUNCT_1:77;
end;
then reconsider Y1 = ( f .: X1 ) as  finite (Subset of Y) by TARSKI:def 3;
consider y1 being (Element of L2) such that A7: y1 in Y and A8: y1 is_>=_than Y1 by WAYBEL_0:1;
take gy1 = ( g . y1 );
y1 in (the carrier of L2);
then y1 in ( dom g ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence gy1 in ( g .: Y ) by A7,FUNCT_1:def 6;
X1 c= (the carrier of L1) by XBOOLE_1:1;
then X1 c= ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A9: X1 c= ( f " ( f .: X1 ) ) by FUNCT_1:76;
( g .: Y1 ) = ( f " ( f .: X1 ) ) by A3,FUNCT_1:85
.= X1 by A9,A6,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence gy1 is_>=_than X1 by A4,A8,CKB20:1;
end;
then reconsider X = ( g .: Y ) as non empty  directed (Subset of L1) by WAYBEL_0:1;
 ex_sup_of X,L1 by A2,WAYBEL_0:75;
then consider x being (Element of L1) such that A10: X is_<=_than x and A11: (for b being (Element of L1) holds (X is_<=_than b implies x <= b)) by YELLOW_0:15;
A12:now
let y being (Element of L2);
assume Y is_<=_than y;
then X is_<=_than ( g . y ) by A4,CKB20:1;
then x <= ( g . y ) by A11;
then A13: ( f . x ) <= ( f . ( g . y ) ) by A3,WAYBEL_0:66;
y in (the carrier of L2);
then y in ( dom g ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then y in ( rng f ) by A3,FUNCT_1:33;
hence ( f . x ) <= y by A3,A13,FUNCT_1:35;
end;
( f .: X ) = ( f .: ( f " Y ) ) by A3,FUNCT_1:85
.= Y by A5,FUNCT_1:77;
then Y is_<=_than ( f . x ) by A3,A10,CKB20:1;
hence  ex_sup_of Y,L2 by A12,YELLOW_0:15;
end;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:75;
