theorem
Th21: (for L1,L2,L3 being non empty  transitive  antisymmetric RelStr holds (for f being (Function of L1,L2) holds (f is  infs-preserving implies ((L2 is  full  infs-inheriting  full  infs-inheriting (SubRelStr of L3) & L3 is  complete) implies (ex g being (Function of L1,L3) st (f = g & g is  infs-preserving))))))
proof
let L1 being non empty  transitive  antisymmetric RelStr,L2 being non empty  transitive  antisymmetric RelStr,L3 being non empty  transitive  antisymmetric RelStr;
let f being (Function of L1,L2);
assume that
A1: f is  infs-preserving
and
A2: L2 is  full  infs-inheriting  full  infs-inheriting (SubRelStr of L3)
and
A3: L3 is  complete;
(the carrier of L2) c= (the carrier of L3) by A2,YELLOW_0:def 13;
then reconsider g = f as (Function of L1,L3) by FUNCT_2:7;
take g;
thus f = g;
now
let X being (Subset of L1);
now
A4: f preserves_inf_of X by A1,WAYBEL_0:def 32;
assume A5:  ex_inf_of X,L1;
thus A6:  ex_inf_of ( g .: X ),L3 by A3,YELLOW_0:17;
then ( "/\" (( f .: X ),L3) ) in (the carrier of L2) by A2,YELLOW_0:def 18;
hence ( inf ( g .: X ) ) = ( inf ( f .: X ) ) by A2,A6,YELLOW_0:63
.= ( g . ( inf X ) ) by A5,A4,WAYBEL_0:def 30;
end;
hence g preserves_inf_of X by WAYBEL_0:def 30;
end;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:def 32;
end;
