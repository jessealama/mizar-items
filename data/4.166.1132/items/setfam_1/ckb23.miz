func UNION (SFX,SFY)
means
:Def4: (Z in it iff (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X \/ Y )))));
existence
proof
defpred X[ set ]
 means
(ex Z being set st ($1 = Z & (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X \/ Y ))))));
consider XX being set such that A1: (for x holds (x in XX iff (x in ( bool ( ( union SFX ) \/ ( union SFY ) ) ) & X[ x ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
take XX;
(for Z holds (Z in XX iff (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X \/ Y ))))))
proof
let Z;
A2:now
given X,Y such that
A3: (X in SFX & Y in SFY)
and
A4: Z = ( X \/ Y );

(X c= ( union SFX ) & Y c= ( union SFY )) by A3,ZFMISC_1:74;
then Z c= ( ( union SFX ) \/ ( union SFY ) ) by A4,XBOOLE_1:13;
hence Z in XX by A1,A3,A4;
end;
now
assume Z in XX;
then (ex Z1 st (Z = Z1 & (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z1 = ( X \/ Y )))))) by A1;
hence (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X \/ Y ))));
end;
hence thesis by A2;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let Z1 being set,Z2 being set;
assume that
A5: (for Z holds (Z in Z1 iff (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X \/ Y ))))))
and
A6: (for Z holds (Z in Z2 iff (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X \/ Y ))))));
now
let Z;
(Z in Z1 iff (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X \/ Y ))))) by A5;
hence (Z in Z1 iff Z in Z2) by A6;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
end;
commutativity
proof
let SFZ;
let SFX;
let SFY;
assume A7: (for Z holds (Z in SFZ iff (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X \/ Y ))))));
let Z;
hereby
assume Z in SFZ;
then (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X \/ Y )))) by A7;
hence (ex Y st (ex X st ((Y in SFY & X in SFX) & Z = ( Y \/ X ))));
end;
thus thesis by A7;
