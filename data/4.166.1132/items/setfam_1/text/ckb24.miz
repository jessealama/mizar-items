func INTERSECTION (SFX,SFY) means 
:Def5: (Z in it iff (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X /\ Y )))));
existence
proof
defpred X[ set ]
 means
(ex Z being set st ($1 = Z & (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X /\ Y ))))));
consider XX being set such that A8: (for x holds (x in XX iff (x in ( bool ( ( union SFX ) /\ ( union SFY ) ) ) & X[ x ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
take XX;
(for Z holds (Z in XX iff (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X /\ Y ))))))
proof
let Z;
A9:now
given X,Y such that
A10: (X in SFX & Y in SFY)
and
A11: Z = ( X /\ Y );

(X c= ( union SFX ) & Y c= ( union SFY )) by A10,ZFMISC_1:74;
then Z c= ( ( union SFX ) /\ ( union SFY ) ) by A11,XBOOLE_1:27;
hence Z in XX by A8,A10,A11;
end;
now
assume Z in XX;
then (ex Z1 st (Z = Z1 & (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z1 = ( X /\ Y )))))) by A8;
hence (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X /\ Y ))));
end;
hence thesis by A9;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let Z1 being set;
let Z2 being set;
assume that
A12: (for Z holds (Z in Z1 iff (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X /\ Y ))))))
and
A13: (for Z holds (Z in Z2 iff (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X /\ Y ))))));
now
let Z;
(Z in Z1 iff (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X /\ Y ))))) by A12;
hence (Z in Z1 iff Z in Z2) by A13;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
end;
commutativity
proof
let SFZ;
let SFX;
let SFY;
assume A14: (for Z holds (Z in SFZ iff (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X /\ Y ))))));
let Z;
hereby
assume Z in SFZ;
then (ex X st (ex Y st ((X in SFX & Y in SFY) & Z = ( X /\ Y )))) by A14;
hence (ex Y st (ex X st ((Y in SFY & X in SFX) & Z = ( Y /\ X ))));

thus thesis by A14;
