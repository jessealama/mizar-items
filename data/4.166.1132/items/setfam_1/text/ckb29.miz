theorem
(SFX meets SFY implies ( ( meet SFX ) /\ ( meet SFY ) ) = ( meet ( INTERSECTION (SFX,SFY) ) ))
proof
set y = the (Element of ( SFX /\ SFY ));
assume A1: ( SFX /\ SFY ) <> ( {} );
then A2: SFY <> ( {} );
A3: y in SFX by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A4: y in SFY by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A5: SFX <> ( {} ) by A1;
A6: ( meet ( INTERSECTION (SFX,SFY) ) ) c= ( ( meet SFX ) /\ ( meet SFY ) )
proof
let x;
assume that
A7: x in ( meet ( INTERSECTION (SFX,SFY) ) );
(for Z holds (Z in SFY implies x in Z))
proof
let Z;
assume Z in SFY;
then ( y /\ Z ) in ( INTERSECTION (SFX,SFY) ) by A3,CKB24:def 1;
then x in ( y /\ Z ) by A7,CKB1:def 1;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
then A8: x in ( meet SFY ) by A2,CKB1:def 1;
(for Z holds (Z in SFX implies x in Z))
proof
let Z;
assume Z in SFX;
then ( Z /\ y ) in ( INTERSECTION (SFX,SFY) ) by A4,CKB24:def 1;
then x in ( Z /\ y ) by A7,CKB1:def 1;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
then x in ( meet SFX ) by A5,CKB1:def 1;
hence thesis by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
A9: ( y /\ y ) in ( INTERSECTION (SFX,SFY) ) by A3,A4,CKB24:def 1;
( ( meet SFX ) /\ ( meet SFY ) ) c= ( meet ( INTERSECTION (SFX,SFY) ) )
proof
let x;
assume x in ( ( meet SFX ) /\ ( meet SFY ) );
then A10: (x in ( meet SFX ) & x in ( meet SFY )) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
(for Z holds (Z in ( INTERSECTION (SFX,SFY) ) implies x in Z))
proof
let Z;
assume Z in ( INTERSECTION (SFX,SFY) );
then consider Z1,Z2 such that A11: (Z1 in SFX & Z2 in SFY) and A12: Z = ( Z1 /\ Z2 ) by CKB24:def 1;
(x in Z1 & x in Z2) by A10,A11,CKB1:def 1;
hence thesis by A12,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
hence thesis by A9,CKB1:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
