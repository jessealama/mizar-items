let X being set;
func bspace-scalar-mult X -> (Function of [: (the carrier of ( Z_2 )),( bool X ) :],( bool X ))
means
:Def6: (for a being (Element of ( Z_2 )) holds (for c being (Subset of X) holds ( it . (a,c) ) = ( a \*\ c )));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set,set,set ]
 means
(ex a being (Element of ( Z_2 )) st (ex c being (Subset of X) st (($1 = a & $2 = c) & $3 = ( a \*\ c ))));
A1: (for x,y being set holds ((x in (the carrier of ( Z_2 )) & y in ( bool X )) implies (ex z being set st (z in ( bool X ) & P[ x,y,z ]))))
proof
let x being set,y being set;
assume that
A2: x in (the carrier of ( Z_2 ))
and
A3: y in ( bool X );
reconsider y as (Subset of X) by A3;
reconsider x as (Element of ( Z_2 )) by A2;
set z = ( x \*\ y );
take z;
thus thesis;

consider f being (Function of [: (the carrier of ( Z_2 )),( bool X ) :],( bool X )) such that A4: (for x,y being set holds ((x in (the carrier of ( Z_2 )) & y in ( bool X )) implies P[ x,y,( f . (x,y) ) ])) from BINOP_1:sch 1(A1);
take f;
(for a being (Element of ( Z_2 )) holds (for c being (Subset of X) holds ( f . (a,c) ) = ( a \*\ c )))
proof
let a being (Element of ( Z_2 ));
let c being (Subset of X);
(ex a9 being (Element of ( Z_2 )) st (ex c9 being (Subset of X) st ((a = a9 & c = c9) & ( f . (a,c) ) = ( a9 \*\ c9 )))) by A4;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis;

uniqueness
proof
let f being (Function of [: (the carrier of ( Z_2 )),( bool X ) :],( bool X )),g being (Function of [: (the carrier of ( Z_2 )),( bool X ) :],( bool X ));
assume that
A5: ((for a being (Element of ( Z_2 )) holds (for c being (Subset of X) holds ( f . (a,c) ) = ( a \*\ c ))) & (for a being (Element of ( Z_2 )) holds (for c being (Subset of X) holds ( g . (a,c) ) = ( a \*\ c ))));
A6: (for x being set holds (x in ( dom f ) implies ( f . x ) = ( g . x )))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( dom f );
then consider y being set,z being set such that A7: y in (the carrier of ( Z_2 )) and A8: z in ( bool X ) and A9: x = [ y,z ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider z as (Subset of X) by A8;
reconsider y as (Element of ( Z_2 )) by A7;
(( f . (y,z) ) = ( y \*\ z ) & ( g . (y,z) ) = ( y \*\ z )) by A5;
hence thesis by A9;
end;
( dom f ) = [: (the carrier of ( Z_2 )),( bool X ) :] by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then ( dom f ) = ( dom g ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence thesis by A6,FUNCT_1:2;
