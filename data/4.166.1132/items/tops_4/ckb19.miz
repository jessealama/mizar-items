theorem
(for f being (Function of ( TOP-REAL m ),T) holds (f is  continuous iff (for p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m )) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (( f . p ) in V implies (ex s being  positive  real number st ( f .: ( Ball (p,s) ) ) c= V))))))
proof
let f being (Function of ( TOP-REAL m ),T);
A1: m in ( NAT ) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
hereby
assume A2: f is  continuous;
let p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m ));
let V being  open (Subset of T);
assume ( f . p ) in V;
then consider W being (Subset of ( TOP-REAL m )) such that A3: p in W and A4: W is  open and A5: ( f .: W ) c= V by A2,JGRAPH_2:10;
reconsider u = p as (Point of ( Euclid m )) by EUCLID:67;
( Int W ) = W by A4,TOPS_1:23;
then consider s being  real number such that A6: s > ( 0 ) and A7: ( Ball (u,s) ) c= W by A1,A3,GOBOARD6:5;
reconsider s as  positive  real number by A6;
take s;
( Ball (u,s) ) = ( Ball (p,s) ) by A1,TOPREAL9:13;
then ( f .: ( Ball (p,s) ) ) c= ( f .: W ) by A7,RELAT_1:123;
hence ( f .: ( Ball (p,s) ) ) c= V by A5,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
assume A8: (for p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m )) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (( f . p ) in V implies (ex s being  positive  real number st ( f .: ( Ball (p,s) ) ) c= V))));
(for p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m )) holds (for V being (Subset of T) holds ((( f . p ) in V & V is  open) implies (ex W being (Subset of ( TOP-REAL m )) st ((p in W & W is  open) & ( f .: W ) c= V)))))
proof
let p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m ));
let V being (Subset of T);
assume that
A9: ( f . p ) in V
and
A10: V is  open;
consider s being  positive  real number such that A11: ( f .: ( Ball (p,s) ) ) c= V by A8,A9,A10;
take W = ( Ball (p,s) );
thus p in W by A1,TOPGEN_5:13;
thus W is  open;
thus thesis by A11;
end;
hence thesis by JGRAPH_2:10;
