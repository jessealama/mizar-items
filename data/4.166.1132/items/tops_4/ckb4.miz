theorem
Th4: (for f being (Function of T,( TopSpaceMetr M )) holds (f is  open iff (for p being (Point of T) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (for q being (Point of M) holds ((q = ( f . p ) & p in V) implies (ex r being  positive  real number st ( Ball (q,r) ) c= ( f .: V ))))))))
proof
let f being (Function of T,( TopSpaceMetr M ));
thus (f is  open implies (for p being (Point of T) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (for q being (Point of M) holds ((q = ( f . p ) & p in V) implies (ex r being  positive  real number st ( Ball (q,r) ) c= ( f .: V )))))))
proof
assume A1: f is  open;
let p being (Point of T);
let V being  open (Subset of T);
let q being (Point of M);
assume that
A2: q = ( f . p );
assume p in V;
then consider W being  open (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M )) such that A3: ( f . p ) in W and A4: W c= ( f .: V ) by A1,CKB3:1;
(ex r being  real number st (r > ( 0 ) & ( Ball (q,r) ) c= W)) by A2,A3,TOPMETR:15;
hence thesis by A4,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;

assume A5: (for p being (Point of T) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (for q being (Point of M) holds ((q = ( f . p ) & p in V) implies (ex r being  positive  real number st ( Ball (q,r) ) c= ( f .: V ))))));
(for p being (Point of T) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (p in V implies (ex W being  open (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M )) st (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: V ))))))
proof
let p being (Point of T);
let V being  open (Subset of T);
reconsider q = ( f . p ) as (Point of M);
assume p in V;
then consider r being  positive  real number such that A6: ( Ball (q,r) ) c= ( f .: V ) by A5;
reconsider W = ( Ball (q,r) ) as  open (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M )) by TOPMETR:14;
take W;
thus ( f . p ) in W by GOBOARD6:1;
thus W c= ( f .: V ) by A6;
end;
hence thesis by CKB3:1;
