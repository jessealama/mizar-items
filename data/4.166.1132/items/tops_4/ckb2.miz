theorem
(for P being (Subset of ( TOP-REAL m )) holds (P is  open iff (for p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m )) holds (p in P implies (ex r being  positive  real number st ( Ball (p,r) ) c= P)))))
proof
let P being (Subset of ( TOP-REAL m ));
A1: ( the TopStruct of ( TOP-REAL m ) ) = ( TopSpaceMetr ( Euclid m ) ) by EUCLID:def 8;
then reconsider P1 = P as (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr ( Euclid m ) ));
A2: m in ( NAT ) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
hereby
assume A3: P is  open;
let p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m ));
assume A4: p in P;
reconsider e = p as (Point of ( Euclid m )) by EUCLID:67;
P1 is  open by A3,A1,TOPS_3:76;
then consider r being  real number such that A5: r > ( 0 ) and A6: ( Ball (e,r) ) c= P1 by A4,TOPMETR:15;
reconsider r as  positive  real number by A5;
take r;
thus ( Ball (p,r) ) c= P by A2,A6,TOPREAL9:13;
end;
assume A7: (for p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m )) holds (p in P implies (ex r being  positive  real number st ( Ball (p,r) ) c= P)));
(for p being (Point of ( Euclid m )) holds (p in P1 implies (ex r being  real number st (r > ( 0 ) & ( Ball (p,r) ) c= P1))))
proof
let p being (Point of ( Euclid m ));
assume A8: p in P1;
reconsider e = p as (Point of ( TOP-REAL m )) by EUCLID:67;
consider r being  positive  real number such that A9: ( Ball (e,r) ) c= P1 by A7,A8;
take r;
thus thesis by A2,A9,TOPREAL9:13;
end;
then P1 is  open by TOPMETR:15;
hence thesis by A1,TOPS_3:76;
