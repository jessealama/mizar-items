theorem
(for f being (Function of T,( TOP-REAL m )) holds (f is  open iff (for p being (Point of T) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (p in V implies (ex r being  positive  real number st ( Ball (( f . p ),r) ) c= ( f .: V )))))))
proof
let f being (Function of T,( TOP-REAL m ));
A1: ( the TopStruct of ( TOP-REAL m ) ) = ( TopSpaceMetr ( Euclid m ) ) by EUCLID:def 8;
then reconsider f1 = f as (Function of T,( TopSpaceMetr ( Euclid m ) ));
A2: ( the TopStruct of T ) = ( the TopStruct of T );
A3: m in ( NAT ) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
thus (f is  open implies (for p being (Point of T) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (p in V implies (ex r being  positive  real number st ( Ball (( f . p ),r) ) c= ( f .: V ))))))
proof
assume A4: f is  open;
let p being (Point of T);
let V being  open (Subset of T);
assume A5: p in V;
reconsider fp = ( f . p ) as (Point of ( Euclid m )) by EUCLID:67;
f1 is  open by A4,A1,A2,CKB1:1;
then consider r being  positive  real number such that A6: ( Ball (fp,r) ) c= ( f1 .: V ) by A5,CKB4:1;
( Ball (( f . p ),r) ) = ( Ball (fp,r) ) by A3,TOPREAL9:13;
hence thesis by A6;
end;

assume A7: (for p being (Point of T) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (p in V implies (ex r being  positive  real number st ( Ball (( f . p ),r) ) c= ( f .: V )))));
(for p being (Point of T) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (for q being (Point of ( Euclid m )) holds ((q = ( f1 . p ) & p in V) implies (ex r being  positive  real number st ( Ball (q,r) ) c= ( f1 .: V ))))))
proof
let p being (Point of T);
let V being  open (Subset of T);
let q being (Point of ( Euclid m ));
assume that
A8: q = ( f1 . p );
assume p in V;
then consider r being  positive  real number such that A9: ( Ball (( f . p ),r) ) c= ( f .: V ) by A7;
( Ball (( f . p ),r) ) = ( Ball (q,r) ) by A3,A8,TOPREAL9:13;
hence thesis by A9;
end;
then f1 is  open by CKB4:1;
hence thesis by A1,A2,CKB1:1;
