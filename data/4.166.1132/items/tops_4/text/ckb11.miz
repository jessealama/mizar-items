theorem
(for f being (Function of ( R^1 ),T) holds (f is  open iff (for p being (Point of ( R^1 )) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex V being  open (Subset of T) st (( f . p ) in V & V c= ( f .: ]. ( p - r ),( p + r ) .[ )))))))
proof
let f being (Function of ( R^1 ),T);
thus (f is  open implies (for p being (Point of ( R^1 )) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: ]. ( p - r ),( p + r ) .[ ))))))
proof
assume A1: f is  open;
let p being (Point of ( R^1 ));
let r being  positive  real number;
reconsider q = p as (Point of ( RealSpace ));
consider W being  open (Subset of T) such that A2: (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: ( Ball (q,r) ) )) by A1,CKB5:1;
r in ( REAL ) by XREAL_0:def 1;
then ]. ( q - r ),( q + r ) .[ = ( Ball (q,r) ) by FRECHET:7;
hence thesis by A2;

assume A3: (for p being (Point of ( R^1 )) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: ]. ( p - r ),( p + r ) .[ )))));
(for p being (Point of ( RealSpace )) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) )))))
proof
let p being (Point of ( RealSpace ));
let r being  positive  real number;
reconsider q = p as (Point of ( R^1 ));
consider W being  open (Subset of T) such that A4: (( f . q ) in W & W c= ( f .: ]. ( p - r ),( p + r ) .[ )) by A3;
r in ( REAL ) by XREAL_0:def 1;
then ]. ( p - r ),( p + r ) .[ = ( Ball (p,r) ) by FRECHET:7;
hence thesis by A4;
