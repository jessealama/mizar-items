theorem
(for f being (Function of T,( TOP-REAL m )) holds (f is  continuous iff (for p being (Point of T) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (p in W & ( f .: W ) c= ( Ball (( f . p ),r) )))))))
proof
let f being (Function of T,( TOP-REAL m ));
A1: m in ( NAT ) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
thus (f is  continuous implies (for p being (Point of T) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (p in W & ( f .: W ) c= ( Ball (( f . p ),r) ))))))
proof
assume A2: f is  continuous;
let p being (Point of T);
let r being  positive  real number;
( f . p ) in ( Ball (( f . p ),r) ) by A1,TOPGEN_5:13;
then (ex W being (Subset of T) st ((p in W & W is  open) & ( f .: W ) c= ( Ball (( f . p ),r) ))) by A2,JGRAPH_2:10;
hence thesis;

assume A3: (for p being (Point of T) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (p in W & ( f .: W ) c= ( Ball (( f . p ),r) )))));
(for p being (Point of T) holds (for V being (Subset of ( TOP-REAL m )) holds ((( f . p ) in V & V is  open) implies (ex W being (Subset of T) st ((p in W & W is  open) & ( f .: W ) c= V)))))
proof
let p being (Point of T);
let V being (Subset of ( TOP-REAL m ));
assume that
A4: ( f . p ) in V;
reconsider u = ( f . p ) as (Point of ( Euclid m )) by EUCLID:67;
assume V is  open;
then ( Int V ) = V by TOPS_1:23;
then consider e being  real number such that A5: e > ( 0 ) and A6: ( Ball (u,e) ) c= V by A1,A4,GOBOARD6:5;
A7: ( Ball (u,e) ) = ( Ball (( f . p ),e) ) by A1,TOPREAL9:13;
(ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (p in W & ( f .: W ) c= ( Ball (( f . p ),e) ))) by A3,A5;
hence thesis by A6,A7,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
hence thesis by JGRAPH_2:10;
