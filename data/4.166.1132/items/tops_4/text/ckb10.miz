theorem
(for f being (Function of T,( R^1 )) holds (f is  open iff (for p being (Point of T) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (p in V implies (ex r being  positive  real number st ]. ( ( f . p ) - r ),( ( f . p ) + r ) .[ c= ( f .: V )))))))
proof
let f being (Function of T,( R^1 ));
thus (f is  open implies (for p being (Point of T) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (p in V implies (ex r being  positive  real number st ]. ( ( f . p ) - r ),( ( f . p ) + r ) .[ c= ( f .: V ))))))
proof
assume A1: f is  open;
let p being (Point of T);
let V being  open (Subset of T);
assume A2: p in V;
reconsider fp = ( f . p ) as (Point of ( RealSpace ));
consider r being  positive  real number such that A3: ( Ball (fp,r) ) c= ( f .: V ) by A1,A2,CKB4:1;
r in ( REAL ) by XREAL_0:def 1;
then ]. ( fp - r ),( fp + r ) .[ = ( Ball (fp,r) ) by FRECHET:7;
hence thesis by A3;
end;

assume A4: (for p being (Point of T) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (p in V implies (ex r being  positive  real number st ]. ( ( f . p ) - r ),( ( f . p ) + r ) .[ c= ( f .: V )))));
(for p being (Point of T) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (for q being (Point of ( RealSpace )) holds ((q = ( f . p ) & p in V) implies (ex r being  positive  real number st ( Ball (q,r) ) c= ( f .: V ))))))
proof
let p being (Point of T);
let V being  open (Subset of T);
let q being (Point of ( RealSpace ));
assume that
A5: q = ( f . p );
assume p in V;
then consider r being  positive  real number such that A6: ]. ( ( f . p ) - r ),( ( f . p ) + r ) .[ c= ( f .: V ) by A4;
r in ( REAL ) by XREAL_0:def 1;
then ]. ( q - r ),( q + r ) .[ = ( Ball (q,r) ) by FRECHET:7;
hence thesis by A5,A6;

hence thesis by CKB4:1;
