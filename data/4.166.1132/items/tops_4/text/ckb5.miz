theorem
Th5: (for f being (Function of ( TopSpaceMetr M ),T) holds (f is  open iff (for p being (Point of M) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) )))))))
proof
let f being (Function of ( TopSpaceMetr M ),T);
hereby
assume A1: f is  open;
let p being (Point of M);
let r being  positive  real number;
A2: p in ( Ball (p,r) ) by GOBOARD6:1;
reconsider V = ( Ball (p,r) ) as (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M ));
V is  open by TOPMETR:14;
then consider W being  open (Subset of T) such that A3: (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: V )) by A1,A2,CKB3:1;
take W;
thus (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) )) by A3;
end;
assume A4: (for p being (Point of M) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) )))));
(for p being (Point of ( TopSpaceMetr M )) holds (for V being  open (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M )) holds (p in V implies (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: V ))))))
proof
let p being (Point of ( TopSpaceMetr M ));
let V being  open (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M ));
reconsider q = p as (Point of M);
assume p in V;
then consider r being  real number such that A5: r > ( 0 ) and A6: ( Ball (q,r) ) c= V by TOPMETR:15;
consider W being  open (Subset of T) such that A7: ( f . p ) in W and A8: W c= ( f .: ( Ball (q,r) ) ) by A4,A5;
take W;
thus ( f . p ) in W by A7;
( f .: ( Ball (q,r) ) ) c= ( f .: V ) by A6,RELAT_1:123;
