theorem
(for f being (Function of ( R^1 ),( TOP-REAL m )) holds (f is  open iff (for p being (Point of ( R^1 )) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex s being  positive  real number st ( Ball (( f . p ),s) ) c= ( f .: ]. ( p - r ),( p + r ) .[ ))))))
proof
let f being (Function of ( R^1 ),( TOP-REAL m ));
A1: ( the TopStruct of ( TOP-REAL m ) ) = ( TopSpaceMetr ( Euclid m ) ) by EUCLID:def 8;
then reconsider f1 = f as (Function of ( R^1 ),( TopSpaceMetr ( Euclid m ) ));
A2: m in ( NAT ) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
thus (f is  open implies (for p being (Point of ( R^1 )) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex s being  positive  real number st ( Ball (( f . p ),s) ) c= ( f .: ]. ( p - r ),( p + r ) .[ )))))
proof
assume A3: f is  open;
let p being (Point of ( R^1 ));
let r being  positive  real number;
reconsider p1 = p as (Point of ( RealSpace ));
reconsider q1 = ( f . p ) as (Point of ( Euclid m )) by EUCLID:67;
f1 is  open by A1,A3,CKB1:1;
then consider s being  positive  real number such that A4: ( Ball (q1,s) ) c= ( f1 .: ( Ball (p1,r) ) ) by CKB6:1;
r in ( REAL ) by XREAL_0:def 1;
then (]. ( p - r ),( p + r ) .[ = ( Ball (p1,r) ) & ( Ball (( f . p ),s) ) = ( Ball (q1,s) )) by A2,FRECHET:7,TOPREAL9:13;
hence thesis by A4;
end;

assume A5: (for p being (Point of ( R^1 )) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex s being  positive  real number st ( Ball (( f . p ),s) ) c= ( f .: ]. ( p - r ),( p + r ) .[ ))));
(for p being (Point of ( RealSpace )) holds (for q being (Point of ( Euclid m )) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (q = ( f1 . p ) implies (ex s being  positive  real number st ( Ball (q,s) ) c= ( f1 .: ( Ball (p,r) ) ))))))
proof
let p being (Point of ( RealSpace ));
let q being (Point of ( Euclid m ));
let r being  positive  real number;
assume that
A6: q = ( f1 . p );
reconsider p1 = p as (Point of ( R^1 ));
consider s being  positive  real number such that A7: ( Ball (( f . p1 ),s) ) c= ( f .: ]. ( p1 - r ),( p1 + r ) .[ ) by A5;
(r in ( REAL ) & s in ( REAL )) by XREAL_0:def 1;
then (]. ( p1 - r ),( p1 + r ) .[ = ( Ball (p,r) ) & ( Ball (( f . p1 ),s) ) = ( Ball (q,s) )) by A2,A6,FRECHET:7,TOPREAL9:13;
hence thesis by A7;
end;
then f1 is  open by CKB6:1;
hence thesis by A1,CKB1:1;
