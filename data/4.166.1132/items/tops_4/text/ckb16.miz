theorem
(for f being (Function of ( TopSpaceMetr M ),T) holds (f is  continuous iff (for p being (Point of M) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (( f . p ) in V implies (ex s being  positive  real number st ( f .: ( Ball (p,s) ) ) c= V))))))
proof
let f being (Function of ( TopSpaceMetr M ),T);
hereby
assume A1: f is  continuous;
let p being (Point of M);
let V being  open (Subset of T);
assume ( f . p ) in V;
then consider W being (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M )) such that A2: p in W and A3: W is  open and A4: ( f .: W ) c= V by A1,JGRAPH_2:10;
( Int W ) = W by A3,TOPS_1:23;
then consider s being  real number such that A5: s > ( 0 ) and A6: ( Ball (p,s) ) c= W by A2,GOBOARD6:4;
reconsider s as  positive  real number by A5;
take s;
( f .: ( Ball (p,s) ) ) c= ( f .: W ) by A6,RELAT_1:123;
hence ( f .: ( Ball (p,s) ) ) c= V by A4,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
assume A7: (for p being (Point of M) holds (for V being  open (Subset of T) holds (( f . p ) in V implies (ex s being  positive  real number st ( f .: ( Ball (p,s) ) ) c= V))));
(for p being (Point of ( TopSpaceMetr M )) holds (for V being (Subset of T) holds ((( f . p ) in V & V is  open) implies (ex W being (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M )) st ((p in W & W is  open) & ( f .: W ) c= V)))))
proof
let p being (Point of ( TopSpaceMetr M ));
let V being (Subset of T);
assume that
A8: ( f . p ) in V
and
A9: V is  open;
reconsider u = p as (Point of M);
consider s being  positive  real number such that A10: ( f .: ( Ball (u,s) ) ) c= V by A7,A8,A9;
reconsider W = ( Ball (u,s) ) as (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M ));
take W;
thus p in W by GOBOARD6:1;
thus W is  open by TOPMETR:14;
thus thesis by A10;
end;
hence thesis by JGRAPH_2:10;
