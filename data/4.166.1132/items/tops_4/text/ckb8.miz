theorem
(for f being (Function of ( TOP-REAL m ),T) holds (f is  open iff (for p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m )) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) )))))))
proof
let f being (Function of ( TOP-REAL m ),T);
A1: ( the TopStruct of ( TOP-REAL m ) ) = ( TopSpaceMetr ( Euclid m ) ) by EUCLID:def 8;
then reconsider f1 = f as (Function of ( TopSpaceMetr ( Euclid m ) ),T);
A2: ( the TopStruct of T ) = ( the TopStruct of T );
A3: m in ( NAT ) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
thus (f is  open implies (for p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m )) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) ))))))
proof
assume A4: f is  open;
let p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m ));
let r being  positive  real number;
reconsider q = p as (Point of ( Euclid m )) by EUCLID:67;
f1 is  open by A4,A1,A2,CKB1:1;
then consider W being  open (Subset of T) such that A5: (( f1 . p ) in W & W c= ( f1 .: ( Ball (q,r) ) )) by CKB5:1;
( Ball (p,r) ) = ( Ball (q,r) ) by A3,TOPREAL9:13;
hence thesis by A5;
end;

assume A6: (for p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m )) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) )))));
(for p being (Point of ( Euclid m )) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (( f1 . p ) in W & W c= ( f1 .: ( Ball (p,r) ) )))))
proof
let p being (Point of ( Euclid m ));
let r being  positive  real number;
reconsider q = p as (Point of ( TOP-REAL m )) by EUCLID:67;
consider W being  open (Subset of T) such that A7: (( f . q ) in W & W c= ( f .: ( Ball (q,r) ) )) by A6;
( Ball (p,r) ) = ( Ball (q,r) ) by A3,TOPREAL9:13;
hence thesis by A7;
end;
then f1 is  open by CKB5:1;
hence thesis by A1,A2,CKB1:1;
