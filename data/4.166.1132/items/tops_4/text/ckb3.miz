theorem
Th3: (for X,Y being non  empty TopSpace holds (for f being (Function of X,Y) holds (f is  open iff (for p being (Point of X) holds (for V being  open (Subset of X) holds (p in V implies (ex W being  open (Subset of Y) st (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: V )))))))))
proof
let X being non  empty TopSpace;
let Y being non  empty TopSpace;
let f being (Function of X,Y);
thus (f is  open implies (for p being (Point of X) holds (for V being  open (Subset of X) holds (p in V implies (ex W being  open (Subset of Y) st (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: V )))))))
proof
assume A1: f is  open;
let p being (Point of X);
let V being  open (Subset of X);
assume that
A2: p in V;
V is (a_neighborhood of p) by A2,CONNSP_2:3;
then consider W being  open (a_neighborhood of ( f . p )) such that A3: W c= ( f .: V ) by A1,TOPGRP_1:22;
take W;
thus ( f . p ) in W by CONNSP_2:4;
thus thesis by A3;
end;

assume A4: (for p being (Point of X) holds (for V being  open (Subset of X) holds (p in V implies (ex W being  open (Subset of Y) st (( f . p ) in W & W c= ( f .: V ))))));
(for p being (Point of X) holds (for P being  open (a_neighborhood of p) holds (ex R being (a_neighborhood of ( f . p )) st R c= ( f .: P ))))
proof
let p being (Point of X);
let P being  open (a_neighborhood of p);
consider W being  open (Subset of Y) such that A5: ( f . p ) in W and A6: W c= ( f .: P ) by A4,CONNSP_2:4;
W is (a_neighborhood of ( f . p )) by A5,CONNSP_2:3;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
hence thesis by TOPGRP_1:23;
