theorem
Th6: (for f being (Function of ( TopSpaceMetr M1 ),( TopSpaceMetr M2 )) holds (f is  open iff (for p being (Point of M1) holds (for q being (Point of M2) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (q = ( f . p ) implies (ex s being  positive  real number st ( Ball (q,s) ) c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) ))))))))
proof
let f being (Function of ( TopSpaceMetr M1 ),( TopSpaceMetr M2 ));
thus (f is  open implies (for p being (Point of M1) holds (for q being (Point of M2) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (q = ( f . p ) implies (ex s being  positive  real number st ( Ball (q,s) ) c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) )))))))
proof
assume A1: f is  open;
let p being (Point of M1);
let q being (Point of M2);
let r being  positive  real number;
assume that
A2: q = ( f . p );
reconsider V = ( Ball (p,r) ) as (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M1 ));
A3: p in V by GOBOARD6:1;
V is  open by TOPMETR:14;
hence thesis by A1,A2,A3,CKB4:1;
end;

assume A4: (for p being (Point of M1) holds (for q being (Point of M2) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (q = ( f . p ) implies (ex s being  positive  real number st ( Ball (q,s) ) c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) ))))));
(for p being (Point of ( TopSpaceMetr M1 )) holds (for V being  open (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M1 )) holds (for q being (Point of M2) holds ((q = ( f . p ) & p in V) implies (ex r being  positive  real number st ( Ball (q,r) ) c= ( f .: V ))))))
proof
let p being (Point of ( TopSpaceMetr M1 ));
let V being  open (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M1 ));
let q being (Point of M2);
assume that
A5: q = ( f . p );
reconsider p1 = p as (Point of M1);
assume p in V;
then consider r being  real number such that A6: r > ( 0 ) and A7: ( Ball (p1,r) ) c= V by TOPMETR:15;
A8: ( f .: ( Ball (p1,r) ) ) c= ( f .: V ) by A7,RELAT_1:123;
(ex s being  positive  real number st ( Ball (q,s) ) c= ( f .: ( Ball (p1,r) ) )) by A4,A5,A6;
hence thesis by A8,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB4:1;
