theorem
(for f being (Function of ( TOP-REAL m ),( R^1 )) holds (f is  open iff (for p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m )) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex s being  positive  real number st ]. ( ( f . p ) - s ),( ( f . p ) + s ) .[ c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) ))))))
proof
let f being (Function of ( TOP-REAL m ),( R^1 ));
A1: m in ( NAT ) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
hereby
assume A2: f is  open;
let p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m ));
let r being  positive  real number;
p in ( Ball (p,r) ) by A1,TOPGEN_5:13;
then A3: ( f . p ) in ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) ) by FUNCT_2:35;
( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) ) is  open by A2,T_0TOPSP:def 2;
then consider s being (Element of ( REAL )) such that A4: s > ( 0 ) and A5: ]. ( ( f . p ) - s ),( ( f . p ) + s ) .[ c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) ) by A3,FRECHET:8;
reconsider s as  positive  real number by A4;
take s;
thus ]. ( ( f . p ) - s ),( ( f . p ) + s ) .[ c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) ) by A5;
end;
assume A6: (for p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m )) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (ex s being  positive  real number st ]. ( ( f . p ) - s ),( ( f . p ) + s ) .[ c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,r) ) ))));
let A being (Subset of ( TOP-REAL m ));
assume that
A7: A is  open;
(for x being set holds (x in ( f .: A ) iff (ex Q being (Subset of ( R^1 )) st ((Q is  open & Q c= ( f .: A )) & x in Q))))
proof
let x being set;
hereby
assume x in ( f .: A );
then consider p being (Point of ( TOP-REAL m )) such that A8: p in A and A9: x = ( f . p ) by FUNCT_2:65;
reconsider u = p as (Point of ( Euclid m )) by EUCLID:67;
A = ( Int A ) by A7,TOPS_1:23;
then consider e being  real number such that A10: e > ( 0 ) and A11: ( Ball (u,e) ) c= A by A1,A8,GOBOARD6:5;
A12: ( Ball (u,e) ) = ( Ball (p,e) ) by A1,TOPREAL9:13;
consider s being  positive  real number such that A13: ]. ( ( f . p ) - s ),( ( f . p ) + s ) .[ c= ( f .: ( Ball (p,e) ) ) by A6,A10;
take Q = ( R^1 ]. ( ( f . p ) - s ),( ( f . p ) + s ) .[ );
thus Q is  open;
( f .: ( Ball (p,e) ) ) c= ( f .: A ) by A11,A12,RELAT_1:123;
hence Q c= ( f .: A ) by A13,XBOOLE_1:1;
thus x in Q by A9,TOPREAL6:15;
end;
thus thesis;
end;
hence ( f .: A ) is  open by TOPS_1:25;
end;
