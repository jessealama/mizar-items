theorem
(for f being (Function of T,( TopSpaceMetr M )) holds (f is  continuous iff (for p being (Point of T) holds (for q being (Point of M) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (q = ( f . p ) implies (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (p in W & ( f .: W ) c= ( Ball (q,r) )))))))))
proof
let f being (Function of T,( TopSpaceMetr M ));
thus (f is  continuous implies (for p being (Point of T) holds (for q being (Point of M) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (q = ( f . p ) implies (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (p in W & ( f .: W ) c= ( Ball (q,r) ))))))))
proof
assume A1: f is  continuous;
let p being (Point of T);
let q being (Point of M);
let r being  positive  real number;
assume A2: ( f . p ) = q;
reconsider V = ( Ball (q,r) ) as (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M ));
A3: q in ( Ball (q,r) ) by GOBOARD6:1;
V is  open by TOPMETR:14;
then (ex W being (Subset of T) st ((p in W & W is  open) & ( f .: W ) c= V)) by A1,A2,A3,JGRAPH_2:10;
hence thesis;

assume A4: (for p being (Point of T) holds (for q being (Point of M) holds (for r being  positive  real number holds (q = ( f . p ) implies (ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (p in W & ( f .: W ) c= ( Ball (q,r) )))))));
(for p being (Point of T) holds (for V being (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M )) holds ((( f . p ) in V & V is  open) implies (ex W being (Subset of T) st ((p in W & W is  open) & ( f .: W ) c= V)))))
proof
let p being (Point of T);
let V being (Subset of ( TopSpaceMetr M ));
assume that
A5: ( f . p ) in V;
reconsider u = ( f . p ) as (Point of M);
assume V is  open;
then ( Int V ) = V by TOPS_1:23;
then consider e being  real number such that A6: (e > ( 0 ) & ( Ball (u,e) ) c= V) by A5,GOBOARD6:4;
(ex W being  open (Subset of T) st (p in W & ( f .: W ) c= ( Ball (u,e) ))) by A4,A6;
