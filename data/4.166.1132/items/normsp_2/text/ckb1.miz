let k being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume A61: PN[ k ];

( 0 ) < ( r0 . m ) by A34;

proof
assume A71: ( lim x0 ) in ( Y . n );
( lim x0 ) in ( Ball (( x0 . n ),( r0 . n )) ) by A64;

hence contradiction by A34;

(not ( lim x0 ) in ( union ( rng Y ) ))
proof
assume ( lim x0 ) in ( union ( rng Y ) );
then consider A being set such that A72: ( lim x0 ) in A and A73: A in ( rng Y ) by TARSKI:def 4;
(ex k being set st (k in ( dom Y ) & A = ( Y . k ))) by A73,FUNCT_1:def 3;
