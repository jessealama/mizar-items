theorem
(for V,V9,C,C9 being set holds ((V c= V9 & C c= C9) implies (the L_join of ( SubstLatt (V,C) )) = ( (the L_join of ( SubstLatt (V9,C9) )) || (the carrier of ( SubstLatt (V,C) )) )))
proof
let V being set;
let V9 being set;
let C being set;
let C9 being set;
set K = ( SubstLatt (V,C) );
set L = ( SubstLatt (V9,C9) );
A1: ( SubstitutionSet (V,C) ) = (the carrier of K) by SUBSTLAT:def 4;
A2: ( dom (the L_join of L) ) = [: (the carrier of L),(the carrier of L) :] by FUNCT_2:def 1;
reconsider B1 = (the L_join of K) as (BinOp of (the carrier of K));
set B2 = ( (the L_join of L) || (the carrier of K) );
assume A3: (V c= V9 & C c= C9);
( SubstitutionSet (V9,C9) ) = (the carrier of L) by SUBSTLAT:def 4;
then (the carrier of K) c= (the carrier of L) by A1,A3,CKB14:1;
then A4: ( dom B2 ) = [: (the carrier of K),(the carrier of K) :] by A2,RELAT_1:62,ZFMISC_1:96;
A5: ( SubstitutionSet (V,C) ) c= ( SubstitutionSet (V9,C9) ) by A3,CKB14:1;
( rng B2 ) c= (the carrier of K)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( rng B2 );
then consider y being set such that A6: y in ( dom B2 ) and A7: x = ( B2 . y ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
consider y1,y2 being set such that A8: (y1 in (the carrier of K) & y2 in (the carrier of K)) and A9: y = [ y1,y2 ] by A4,A6,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
(y1 in ( SubstitutionSet (V,C) ) & y2 in ( SubstitutionSet (V,C) )) by A8,SUBSTLAT:def 4;
then reconsider y19 = y1,y29 = y2 as (Element of ( SubstitutionSet (V9,C9) )) by A5;
reconsider y11 = y1,y22 = y2 as (Element of ( SubstitutionSet (V,C) )) by A8,SUBSTLAT:def 4;
( B2 . y ) = ( (the L_join of L) . (y1,y2) ) by A4,A6,A9,FUNCT_1:49
.= ( mi ( y19 \/ y29 ) ) by SUBSTLAT:def 4
.= ( mi ( y11 \/ y22 ) ) by A3,CKB15:1;
hence thesis by A1,A7;
end;
then reconsider B2 as (BinOp of (the carrier of K)) by A4,FUNCT_2:2;
now
let a being (Element of K);
let b being (Element of K);
reconsider a9 = a,b9 = b as (Element of ( SubstitutionSet (V,C) )) by SUBSTLAT:def 4;
(a9 in ( SubstitutionSet (V,C) ) & b9 in ( SubstitutionSet (V,C) ));
then reconsider a1 = a,b1 = b as (Element of ( SubstitutionSet (V9,C9) )) by A5;
thus ( B1 . (a,b) ) = ( mi ( a9 \/ b9 ) ) by SUBSTLAT:def 4
.= ( mi ( a1 \/ b1 ) ) by A3,CKB15:1
.= ( (the L_join of L) . (a,b) ) by SUBSTLAT:def 4
.= ( B2 . [ a,b ] ) by FUNCT_1:49
.= ( B2 . (a,b) );
end;
hence thesis by BINOP_1:2;
end;
