theorem
(for V,V9,C,C9 being set holds ((V c= V9 & C c= C9) implies ( SubstPoset (V,C) ) is  full  full (SubRelStr of ( SubstPoset (V9,C9) ))))
proof
let V being set,V9 being set,C being set,C9 being set;
set K = ( SubstPoset (V,C) );
set L = ( SubstPoset (V9,C9) );
A1: ((the carrier of K) = ( SubstitutionSet (V,C) ) & (the carrier of L) = ( SubstitutionSet (V9,C9) )) by SUBSTLAT:def 4;
assume (V c= V9 & C c= C9);
then A2: (the carrier of K) c= (the carrier of L) by A1,CKB14:1;
now
let a being set,b being set;
assume A3: [ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of K);
then reconsider a9 = a,b9 = b as (Element of K) by ZFMISC_1:87;
(a in (the carrier of K) & b in (the carrier of K)) by A3,ZFMISC_1:87;
then reconsider a1 = a,b1 = b as (Element of L) by A2;
a9 <= b9 by A3,ORDERS_2:def 5;
then (for x being set holds (x in a9 implies (ex y being set st (y in b9 & y c= x)))) by CKB20:1;
then a1 <= b1 by CKB20:1;
hence [ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of L) by ORDERS_2:def 5;
end;
then (the InternalRel of K) c= (the InternalRel of L) by RELAT_1:def 3;
then reconsider K as (SubRelStr of L) by A2,YELLOW_0:def 13;
now
let x being set,y being set;
assume A4: [ x,y ] in ( (the InternalRel of L) |_2 (the carrier of K) );
then A5: [ x,y ] in (the InternalRel of L) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then reconsider p = x,q = y as (Element of L) by ZFMISC_1:87;
[ x,y ] in [: (the carrier of K),(the carrier of K) :] by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then reconsider p9 = x,q9 = y as (Element of K) by ZFMISC_1:87;
p <= q by A5,ORDERS_2:def 5;
then (for a being set holds (a in p implies (ex b being set st (b in q & b c= a)))) by CKB20:1;
then p9 <= q9 by CKB20:1;
hence [ x,y ] in (the InternalRel of K) by ORDERS_2:def 5;
end;
then A6: ( (the InternalRel of L) |_2 (the carrier of K) ) c= (the InternalRel of K) by RELAT_1:def 3;
now
let x being set,y being set;
assume A7: [ x,y ] in (the InternalRel of K);
then reconsider p = x,q = y as (Element of K) by ZFMISC_1:87;
(x in (the carrier of K) & y in (the carrier of K)) by A7,ZFMISC_1:87;
then reconsider p9 = p,q9 = q as (Element of L) by A2;
p <= q by A7,ORDERS_2:def 5;
then (for a being set holds (a in p implies (ex b being set st (b in q & b c= a)))) by CKB20:1;
then p9 <= q9 by CKB20:1;
then [ p9,q9 ] in (the InternalRel of L) by ORDERS_2:def 5;
hence [ x,y ] in ( (the InternalRel of L) |_2 (the carrier of K) ) by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
then (the InternalRel of K) c= ( (the InternalRel of L) |_2 (the carrier of K) ) by RELAT_1:def 3;
then (the InternalRel of K) = ( (the InternalRel of L) |_2 (the carrier of K) ) by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
