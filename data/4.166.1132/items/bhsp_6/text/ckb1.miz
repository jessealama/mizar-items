definition
let X;
let Y being  finite (Subset of X);
assume that
A1: ((the addF of X) is  commutative  associative & (the addF of X) is  having_a_unity);

means
:Def1: (ex p being (FinSequence of (the carrier of X)) st ((p is  one-to-one & ( rng p ) = Y) & it = ( (the addF of X) "**" p )));
existence
proof
consider p being FinSequence such that A2: ( rng p ) = Y and A3: p is  one-to-one by FINSEQ_4:58;
reconsider q = p as (FinSequence of (the carrier of X)) by A2,FINSEQ_1:def 4;

hence thesis;

uniqueness
proof
let X1 being (Element of X),X2 being (Element of X);
assume that

and

consider p2 being (FinSequence of (the carrier of X)) such that A6: (p2 is  one-to-one & ( rng p2 ) = Y) and A7: X2 = ( (the addF of X) "**" p2 ) by A5;
consider p1 being (FinSequence of (the carrier of X)) such that A8: (p1 is  one-to-one & ( rng p1 ) = Y) and A9: X1 = ( (the addF of X) "**" p1 ) by A4;
(ex P being (Permutation of ( dom p1 )) st ((p2 = ( p1 * P ) & ( dom P ) = ( dom p1 )) & ( rng P ) = ( dom p1 ))) by A8,A6,BHSP_5:1;
