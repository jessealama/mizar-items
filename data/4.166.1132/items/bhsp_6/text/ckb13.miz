theorem
Th6: (for X holds (((the addF of X) is  commutative  associative & (the addF of X) is  having_a_unity) implies (for Y being (Subset of X) holds (Y is  weakly_summable_set implies (ex x st (for L being (linear-Functional of X) holds (L is  Bounded implies (for e being Real holds (e > ( 0 ) implies (ex Y0 being  finite (Subset of X) st ((Y0 is non  empty & Y0 c= Y) & (for Y1 being  finite (Subset of X) holds ((Y0 c= Y1 & Y1 c= Y) implies ( abs ( ( L . x ) - ( setopfunc (Y1,(the carrier of X),( REAL ),L,( addreal )) ) ) ) < e)))))))))))))
proof
let X;
assume that
A1: ((the addF of X) is  commutative  associative & (the addF of X) is  having_a_unity);
let Y being (Subset of X);
assume Y is  weakly_summable_set;
then consider x such that A2: (for L being (linear-Functional of X) holds (L is  Bounded implies (for e being Real holds (e > ( 0 ) implies (ex Y0 being  finite (Subset of X) st ((Y0 is non  empty & Y0 c= Y) & (for Y1 being  finite (Subset of X) holds ((Y0 c= Y1 & Y1 c= Y) implies ( abs ( L . ( x - ( setsum Y1 ) ) ) ) < e)))))))) by CKB7:def 1;
take x;
now
let L being (linear-Functional of X);
assume that
A3: L is  Bounded;
now
let e being Real;
assume e > ( 0 );
then consider Y0 being  finite (Subset of X) such that A4: Y0 is non  empty and A5: Y0 c= Y and A6: (for Y1 being  finite (Subset of X) holds ((Y0 c= Y1 & Y1 c= Y) implies ( abs ( L . ( x - ( setsum Y1 ) ) ) ) < e)) by A2,A3;
take Y0;
now
set x1 = x;
let Y1 being  finite (Subset of X);
assume that
A7: Y0 c= Y1
and
A8: Y1 c= Y;
set y1 = ( setsum Y1 );
set r = ( L . ( x - ( setsum Y1 ) ) );
Y1 <> ( {} ) by A4,A7;
then (r = ( ( L . x1 ) - ( L . y1 ) ) & ( L . y1 ) = ( setopfunc (Y1,(the carrier of X),( REAL ),L,( addreal )) )) by A1,CKB12:1,HAHNBAN:19;
hence ( abs ( ( L . x ) - ( setopfunc (Y1,(the carrier of X),( REAL ),L,( addreal )) ) ) ) < e by A6,A7,A8;
end;
hence ((Y0 is non  empty & Y0 c= Y) & (for Y1 being  finite (Subset of X) holds ((Y0 c= Y1 & Y1 c= Y) implies ( abs ( ( L . x ) - ( setopfunc (Y1,(the carrier of X),( REAL ),L,( addreal )) ) ) ) < e))) by A4,A5;
end;
hence (for e being Real holds (e > ( 0 ) implies (ex Y0 being  finite (Subset of X) st ((Y0 is non  empty & Y0 c= Y) & (for Y1 being  finite (Subset of X) holds ((Y0 c= Y1 & Y1 c= Y) implies ( abs ( ( L . x ) - ( setopfunc (Y1,(the carrier of X),( REAL ),L,( addreal )) ) ) ) < e))))));
end;
hence thesis;
