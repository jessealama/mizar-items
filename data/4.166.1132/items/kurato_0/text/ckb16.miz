theorem
(for X being set holds (for A,B,C being (SetSequence of X) holds ((for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( C . n ) = ( ( A . n ) /\ ( B . n ) )) implies ( lim_inf C ) = ( ( lim_inf A ) /\ ( lim_inf B ) ))))
proof
let X being set;
let A being (SetSequence of X);
let B being (SetSequence of X);
let C being (SetSequence of X);
assume A1: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( C . n ) = ( ( A . n ) /\ ( B . n ) ));
thus ( lim_inf C ) c= ( ( lim_inf A ) /\ ( lim_inf B ) )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( lim_inf C );
then consider n being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A2: (for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds x in ( C . ( n + k ) )) by CKB10:1;
(for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds x in ( B . ( n + k ) ))
proof
let k being (Element of ( NAT ));
(( C . ( n + k ) ) = ( ( A . ( n + k ) ) /\ ( B . ( n + k ) ) ) & x in ( C . ( n + k ) )) by A1,A2;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
then A3: x in ( lim_inf B ) by CKB10:1;
(for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds x in ( A . ( n + k ) ))
proof
let k being (Element of ( NAT ));
(( C . ( n + k ) ) = ( ( A . ( n + k ) ) /\ ( B . ( n + k ) ) ) & x in ( C . ( n + k ) )) by A1,A2;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
then x in ( lim_inf A ) by CKB10:1;
hence thesis by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;

thus ( ( lim_inf A ) /\ ( lim_inf B ) ) c= ( lim_inf C )
proof
let x being set;
assume A4: x in ( ( lim_inf A ) /\ ( lim_inf B ) );
then x in ( lim_inf A ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider n1 being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A5: (for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds x in ( A . ( n1 + k ) )) by CKB10:1;
x in ( lim_inf B ) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider n2 being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A6: (for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds x in ( B . ( n2 + k ) )) by CKB10:1;
set n = ( max (n1,n2) );
A7: (for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds x in ( B . ( n + k ) ))
proof
let k being (Element of ( NAT ));
consider g being Nat such that A8: n = ( n2 + g ) by NAT_1:10,XXREAL_0:25;
reconsider g as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
x in ( B . ( n2 + ( g + k ) ) ) by A6;
hence thesis by A8;
end;
A9: (for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds x in ( A . ( n + k ) ))
proof
let k being (Element of ( NAT ));
consider g being Nat such that A10: n = ( n1 + g ) by NAT_1:10,XXREAL_0:25;
reconsider g as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
x in ( A . ( n1 + ( g + k ) ) ) by A5;
hence thesis by A10;
end;
(for k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds x in ( C . ( n + k ) ))
proof
let k being (Element of ( NAT ));
(x in ( A . ( n + k ) ) & x in ( B . ( n + k ) )) by A9,A7;
then x in ( ( A . ( n + k ) ) /\ ( B . ( n + k ) ) ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB10:1;
