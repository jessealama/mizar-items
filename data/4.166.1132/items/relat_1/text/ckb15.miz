definition
let R being set;
func proj1 R -> set means 
:Def4: (x in it iff (ex y st [ x,y ] in R));
existence
proof
defpred Q[ set ]
 means
(ex y st [ $1,y ] in R);
consider X such that A1: (for x holds (x in X iff (x in ( union ( union R ) ) & Q[ x ]))) from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
take X;
let x;
((ex y st [ x,y ] in R) implies x in ( union ( union R ) )) by ZFMISC_1:134;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let X1;
let X2;
assume that
A2: (for x holds (x in X1 iff (ex y st [ x,y ] in R)))
and
A3: (for x holds (x in X2 iff (ex y st [ x,y ] in R)));
now
let x;
(x in X1 iff (ex y st [ x,y ] in R)) by A2;
hence (x in X1 iff x in X2) by A3;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
end;
