definition
let P;
let R;
redefine pred P = R
means
(for a holds (for b holds ([ a,b ] in P iff [ a,b ] in R)))
;compatibility
proof
thus (P = R implies (for a holds (for b holds ([ a,b ] in P iff [ a,b ] in R))));
assume A1: (for a holds (for b holds ([ a,b ] in P iff [ a,b ] in R)));
thus P c= R
proof
let x;
assume A2: x in P;
then (ex y st (ex z st x = [ y,z ])) by CKB1:def 1;
hence x in R by A1,A2;
end;

let x;
assume A3: x in R;
then (ex y st (ex z st x = [ y,z ])) by CKB1:def 1;
hence x in P by A1,A3;
end;
