theorem
(for G being Group holds (for A being non empty (Subset of G) holds (for x being (Element of G) holds ( card A ) = ( card ( ( ( x " ) * A ) * x ) ))))
proof
let G being Group;
let A being non empty (Subset of G);
let x being (Element of G);
set B = ( ( ( x " ) * A ) * x );
(A is non empty & B is non empty)
proof
set a = the (Element of A);
( ( ( x " ) * a ) * x ) in B by CKB15:1;
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider B as non empty (Subset of G);
deffunc F((Element of G)) = ( ( ( x " ) * $1 ) * x );
consider f being (Function of A,(the carrier of G)) such that A1: (for a being (Element of A) holds ( f . a ) = F(a)) from FUNCT_2:sch 4;
A2: ( dom f ) = A by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A3: ( rng f ) c= B
proof
let s being set;
assume s in ( rng f );
then consider a being set such that A4: a in A and A5: s = ( f . a ) by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider a as (Element of A) by A4;
s = F(a) by A1,A5;
hence thesis by CKB15:1;
end;
A6: B c= ( rng f )
proof
let s being set;
assume s in B;
then consider a being (Element of G) such that A7: s = ( ( ( x " ) * a ) * x ) and A8: a in A by CKB15:1;
(ex x being (Element of G) st (x in ( dom f ) & s = ( f . x )))
proof
take a;
thus thesis by A1,A7,A8,FUNCT_2:def 1;

proof
let s being set;

A16: (for a,b being (Element of A) holds (( f . a ) = ( f . b ) implies a = b))
proof
