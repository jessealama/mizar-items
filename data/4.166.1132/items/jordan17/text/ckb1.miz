theorem
Th1: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for a,p1,p2 being (Point of ( TOP-REAL n )) holds (for P being (Subset of ( TOP-REAL n )) holds ((a in P & P is_an_arc_of p1,p2) implies (ex f being (Function of ( I[01] ),( ( TOP-REAL n ) | P )) st (ex r being Real st (((((f is  being_homeomorphism & ( f . ( 0 ) ) = p1) & ( f . 1 ) = p2) & ( 0 ) <= r) & r <= 1) & ( f . r ) = a)))))))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
let a being (Point of ( TOP-REAL n )),p1 being (Point of ( TOP-REAL n )),p2 being (Point of ( TOP-REAL n ));
let P being (Subset of ( TOP-REAL n ));
assume that
A1: a in P;
given f being (Function of ( I[01] ),( ( TOP-REAL n ) | P )) such that
A2: f is  being_homeomorphism
and
A3: (( f . ( 0 ) ) = p1 & ( f . 1 ) = p2);

( rng f ) = ( [#] ( ( TOP-REAL n ) | P ) ) by A2,TOPS_2:def 5
.= (the carrier of ( ( TOP-REAL n ) | P ))
.= P by PRE_TOPC:8;
then consider r being set such that A4: r in ( dom f ) and A5: a = ( f . r ) by A1,FUNCT_1:def 3;
A6: ( dom f ) = ( [#] ( I[01] ) ) by A2,TOPS_2:def 5
.= [. ( 0 ),1 .] by BORSUK_1:40;
then reconsider r as Real by A4;
take f;
take r;
thus ((f is  being_homeomorphism & ( f . ( 0 ) ) = p1) & ( f . 1 ) = p2) by A2,A3;
thus (( 0 ) <= r & r <= 1) by A4,A6,XXREAL_1:1;
thus thesis by A5;
end;
