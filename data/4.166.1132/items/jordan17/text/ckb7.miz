theorem
Th7: (a in P implies (ex e st (a <> e &  LE a,e,P)))
proof
assume A1: a in P;
A2: ( E-max P ) <> ( W-min P ) by TOPREAL5:19;
A3: ( Lower_Arc P ) is_an_arc_of ( E-max P ),( W-min P ) by JORDAN6:def 9;
per cases ;
suppose A4: a = ( W-min P );

take ( E-max P );
thus thesis by A4,JORDAN7:3,SPRECT_1:14,TOPREAL5:19;
end;
suppose A5: a <> ( W-min P );

thus thesis
proof
per cases ;
suppose A6: a in ( Upper_Arc P );

thus thesis
proof

suppose A7: a = ( E-max P );

consider e such that A8: ((e in ( Lower_Arc P ) & e <> ( E-max P )) & e <> ( W-min P )) by A3,JORDAN6:42;

end;
suppose A9: a <> ( E-max P );

take ( E-max P );
( E-max P ) in ( Lower_Arc P ) by JORDAN7:1;
