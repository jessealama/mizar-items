theorem
Th6: (for P being (Subset of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) holds (((a <> b & P is_an_arc_of c,d) &  LE a,b,P,c,d) implies (ex e st (((a <> e & b <> e) &  LE a,e,P,c,d) &  LE e,b,P,c,d))))
proof
let P being (Subset of ( TOP-REAL 2 ));
assume that
A1: a <> b
and
A2: P is_an_arc_of c,d
and
A3:  LE a,b,P,c,d;
b in P by A3,JORDAN5C:def 3;
then consider f being (Function of ( I[01] ),( ( TOP-REAL 2 ) | P )),rb being Real such that A4: f is  being_homeomorphism and A5: (( f . ( 0 ) ) = c & ( f . 1 ) = d) and A6: ( 0 ) <= rb and A7: rb <= 1 and A8: ( f . rb ) = b by A2,CKB1:1;
A9: ( rng f ) = ( [#] ( ( TOP-REAL 2 ) | P ) ) by A4,TOPS_2:def 5
.= (the carrier of ( ( TOP-REAL 2 ) | P ))
.= P by PRE_TOPC:8;
a in P by A3,JORDAN5C:def 3;
then consider ra being set such that A10: ra in ( dom f ) and A11: a = ( f . ra ) by A9,FUNCT_1:def 3;
A12: ( dom f ) = ( [#] ( I[01] ) ) by A4,TOPS_2:def 5
.= [. ( 0 ),1 .] by BORSUK_1:40;
then reconsider ra as Real by A10;
A13: ( 0 ) <= ra by A10,A12,XXREAL_1:1;
A14: ra <= 1 by A10,A12,XXREAL_1:1;
then ra <= rb by A3,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8,A11,A13,JORDAN5C:def 3;
then ra < rb by A1,A8,A11,XXREAL_0:1;
then consider re being  real number such that A15: ra < re and A16: re < rb by XREAL_1:5;
set e = ( f . re );
A17: re <= 1 by A7,A16,XXREAL_0:2;
A18: ( 0 ) <= re by A13,A15,XXREAL_0:2;
then A19: re in ( dom f ) by A12,A17,XXREAL_1:1;
then e in ( rng f ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
then reconsider e as (Point of ( TOP-REAL 2 )) by A9;
take e;
now
assume A20: (a = e or b = e);
(f is  one-to-one & rb in ( dom f )) by A4,A6,A7,A12,TOPS_2:def 5,XXREAL_1:1;
hence contradiction by A8,A10,A11,A15,A16,A19,A20,FUNCT_1:def 4;
end;
hence (a <> e & b <> e);
re is Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
hence thesis by A2,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8,A11,A13,A14,A15,A16,A18,A17,JORDAN5C:8;
end;
