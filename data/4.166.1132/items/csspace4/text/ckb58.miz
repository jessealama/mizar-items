A3: (for x being (Element of X) holds (ex y being (Element of Y) st P[ x,y ]))
proof
let x being (Element of X);

A5: (for m,k being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ||. ( ( xseq . m ) - ( xseq . k ) ) .|| <= ||. ( ( vseq . m ) - ( vseq . k ) ) .||)
proof
let m being (Element of ( NAT )),k being (Element of ( NAT ));
