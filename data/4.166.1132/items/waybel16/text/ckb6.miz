theorem
(for L being  with_infima Poset holds (for X,Y being (Subset of L) holds (for X9,Y9 being (Subset of ( L opp )) holds ((X = X9 & Y = Y9) implies ( X "/\" Y ) = ( X9 "\/" Y9 )))))
proof
let L being  with_infima Poset;
let X being (Subset of L);
let Y being (Subset of L);
let X9 being (Subset of ( L opp ));
let Y9 being (Subset of ( L opp ));
assume A1: (X = X9 & Y = Y9);
thus ( X "/\" Y ) c= ( X9 "\/" Y9 )
proof
let a being set;
assume a in ( X "/\" Y );
then a in { ( p "/\" q ) where p is (Element of L),q is (Element of L): (p in X & q in Y) } by YELLOW_4:def 4;
then consider x,y being (Element of L) such that A2: a = ( x "/\" y ) and A3: (x in X & y in Y);
A4: a = ( ( x ~ ) "\/" ( y ~ ) ) by A2,YELLOW_7:21;
(( x ~ ) in X9 & ( y ~ ) in Y9) by A1,A3,LATTICE3:def 6;
then a in { ( p "\/" q ) where p is (Element of ( L opp )),q is (Element of ( L opp )): (p in X9 & q in Y9) } by A4;
hence thesis by YELLOW_4:def 3;
end;
