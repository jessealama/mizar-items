theorem
(for L being  distributive  complete LATTICE holds (( L opp ) is  meet-continuous implies (for p being (Element of L) holds (p is  completely-irreducible implies (ex k being (Element of L) st (k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) & p is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) )))))))
proof
let L being  distributive  complete LATTICE;
assume A1: ( L opp ) is  meet-continuous;
let p being (Element of L);
assume A2: p is  completely-irreducible;
then reconsider V = ( (the carrier of L) \ ( downarrow p ) ) as  Open (Filter of L) by A1,CKB35:1;
now
let b being (Element of L);
assume b in ( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } );
then b in ( uparrow p ) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence p <= b by WAYBEL_0:18;
end;
then p is_<=_than ( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ) by LATTICE3:def 8;
then A3: p <= ( "/\" (( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ),L) ) by YELLOW_0:33;
( "/\" (( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ),L) ) <> p by A2,CKB24:1;
then A4: p < ( "/\" (( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ),L) ) by A3,ORDERS_2:def 6;
A5: ( ex_inf_of V,L & ( ( inf V ) ~ ) = ( inf V )) by LATTICE3:def 6,YELLOW_0:17;
take k = ( inf V );
reconsider V9 = V as non  empty  directed (Subset of ( L opp )) by YELLOW_7:27;
A6:  ex_inf_of ( { ( p ~ ) } "/\" V9 ),L by YELLOW_0:17;
A7: ( ex_inf_of ( { p } "\/" V ),L &  ex_inf_of ( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ),L) by YELLOW_0:17;
A8: ( { p } "\/" V ) c= ( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( { p } "\/" V );
then x in { ( p "\/" v ) where v is (Element of L): v in V } by YELLOW_4:15;
then consider v being (Element of L) such that A9: x = ( p "\/" v ) and A10: v in V;
(not v in ( downarrow p )) by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then (not v <= p) by WAYBEL_0:17;
then ( p "\/" v ) <> p by YELLOW_0:22;
then A11: (not ( p "\/" v ) in { p }) by TARSKI:def 1;
p <= ( p "\/" v ) by YELLOW_0:22;
then ( p "\/" v ) in ( uparrow p ) by WAYBEL_0:18;
hence thesis by A9,A11,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;

.= ( "/\" (( { ( p ~ ) } "/\" V9 ),L) ) by A6,YELLOW_7:13
.= ( inf ( { p } "\/" V ) ) by A12,CKB5:1;
then A13: ( "/\" (( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ),L) ) <= ( p "\/" k ) by A7,A8,YELLOW_0:35;
A14: (not k <= p)
proof
assume k <= p;
then ( p "\/" k ) = p by YELLOW_0:24;
hence contradiction by A13,A4,ORDERS_2:7;
end;
( uparrow k ) = V
proof
thus ( uparrow k ) c= V
proof
let x being set;
assume A15: x in ( uparrow k );
then reconsider x1 = x as (Element of L);
k <= x1 by A15,WAYBEL_0:18;
then (not x1 <= p) by A14,ORDERS_2:3;
then (not x1 in ( downarrow p )) by WAYBEL_0:17;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;

let x being set;
assume A16: x in V;
then reconsider x1 = x as (Element of L);
k is_<=_than V by YELLOW_0:33;
then k <= x1 by A16,LATTICE3:def 8;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:18;
end;
then k is  compact by WAYBEL_8:2;
hence k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
A17: (not (ex y being (Element of L) st (y in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) ) & p < y)))
proof
given y being (Element of L) such that
A18: y in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) )
and
A19: p < y;

(not y in ( uparrow k )) by A18,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then (k is_<=_than V & (not k <= y)) by WAYBEL_0:18,YELLOW_0:33;
then (not y in V) by LATTICE3:def 8;
then y in ( downarrow p ) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then y <= p by WAYBEL_0:17;
hence contradiction by A19,ORDERS_2:6;
end;
(not p in ( uparrow k )) by A14,WAYBEL_0:18;
then p in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) ) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence thesis by A17,WAYBEL_4:55;
