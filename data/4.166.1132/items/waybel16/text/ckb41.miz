theorem
Th35: (for L being  complete  algebraic LATTICE holds (for p being (Element of L) holds (p is  completely-irreducible implies p = ( "/\" ({ x where x is (Element of L): (x in ( uparrow p ) & (ex k being (Element of L) st (k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) & x is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) )))) },L) ))))
proof
let L being  complete  algebraic LATTICE;
let p being (Element of L);
set A = { x where x is (Element of L): (x in ( uparrow p ) & (ex k being (Element of L) st (k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) & x is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) )))) };
p <= p;
then A1: p in ( uparrow p ) by WAYBEL_0:18;
now
let a being (Element of L);
assume a in A;
then (ex a1 being (Element of L) st ((a1 = a & a1 in ( uparrow p )) & (ex k being (Element of L) st (k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) & a1 is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) )))));
hence p <= a by WAYBEL_0:18;
end;
then A2: p is_<=_than A by LATTICE3:def 8;
assume p is  completely-irreducible;
then consider q being (Element of L) such that A3: p < q and A4: (for s being (Element of L) holds (p < s implies q <= s)) and ( uparrow p ) = ( { p } \/ ( uparrow q ) ) by CKB26:1;
A5: ( compactbelow p ) <> ( compactbelow q )
proof
assume ( compactbelow p ) = ( compactbelow q );
then p = ( sup ( compactbelow q ) ) by WAYBEL_8:def 3
.= q by WAYBEL_8:def 3;
hence contradiction by A3;
end;
p <= q by A3,ORDERS_2:def 6;
then ( compactbelow p ) c= ( compactbelow q ) by WAYBEL13:1;
then (not ( compactbelow q ) c= ( compactbelow p )) by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
then consider k1 being set such that A6: k1 in ( compactbelow q ) and A7: (not k1 in ( compactbelow p )) by TARSKI:def 3;
k1 in { y where y is (Element of L): (q >= y & y is  compact) } by A6,WAYBEL_8:def 2;
then consider k being (Element of L) such that A8: k = k1 and A9: q >= k and A10: k is  compact;
A11: (not (ex y being (Element of L) st (y in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) ) & p < y)))
proof
given y being (Element of L) such that
A12: y in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) )
and
A13: p < y;

q <= y by A4,A13;
then k <= y by A9,ORDERS_2:3;
then y in ( uparrow k ) by WAYBEL_0:18;
hence contradiction by A12,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
(not k <= p) by A7,A8,A10,WAYBEL_8:4;
then (not p in ( uparrow k )) by WAYBEL_0:18;
then p in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) ) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then A14: p is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) ) by A11,WAYBEL_4:55;
k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) by A10,WAYBEL_8:def 1;
then p in A by A1,A14;
then (for u being (Element of L) holds (u is_<=_than A implies p >= u)) by LATTICE3:def 8;
hence thesis by A2,YELLOW_0:33;
