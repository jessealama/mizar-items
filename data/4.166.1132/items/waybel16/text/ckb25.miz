begin
definition
let L being non  empty RelStr;
func Irr L -> (Subset of L) means 
:Def4: (for x being (Element of L) holds (x in it iff x is  completely-irreducible));
existence
proof
defpred P[ (Element of L) ]
 means
$1 is  completely-irreducible;
consider X being (Subset of L) such that A1: (for x being (Element of L) holds (x in X iff P[ x ])) from SUBSET_1:sch 3;
take X;
thus thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let S1 being (Subset of L);
let S2 being (Subset of L);
assume that
A2: (for x being (Element of L) holds (x in S1 iff x is  completely-irreducible))
and
A3: (for x being (Element of L) holds (x in S2 iff x is  completely-irreducible));
now
let x1 being set;
thus (x1 in S1 implies x1 in S2)
proof
assume A4: x1 in S1;
then reconsider x2 = x1 as (Element of L);
x2 is  completely-irreducible by A2,A4;
hence thesis by A3;
end;

thus (x1 in S2 implies x1 in S1)
proof
assume A5: x1 in S2;
then reconsider x2 = x1 as (Element of L);
x2 is  completely-irreducible by A3,A5;
hence thesis by A2;
end;

end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
end;
