theorem
Th20: (for L being non  empty Poset holds (for p being (Element of L) holds (p is  completely-irreducible iff (ex q being (Element of L) st ((p < q & (for s being (Element of L) holds (p < s implies q <= s))) & ( uparrow p ) = ( { p } \/ ( uparrow q ) ))))))
proof
let L being non  empty Poset;
let p being (Element of L);
thus (p is  completely-irreducible implies (ex q being (Element of L) st ((p < q & (for s being (Element of L) holds (p < s implies q <= s))) & ( uparrow p ) = ( { p } \/ ( uparrow q ) ))))
proof
assume A1: p is  completely-irreducible;
then  ex_min_of ( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ),L by CKB23:def 1;
then A2:  ex_inf_of ( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ),L by WAYBEL_1:def 4;
take q = ( "/\" (( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ),L) );
now
let s being (Element of L);
assume s in ( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } );
then s in ( uparrow p ) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
hence p <= s by WAYBEL_0:18;
end;
then p is_<=_than ( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ) by LATTICE3:def 8;
then A3: p <= q by A2,YELLOW_0:def 10;
A4: ( { p } \/ ( uparrow q ) ) c= ( uparrow p )
proof
let x being set;
assume A5: x in ( { p } \/ ( uparrow q ) );
now
per cases  by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A6: x in { p };

A7: p <= p;
x = p by A6,TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A7,WAYBEL_0:18;
end;
suppose A8: x in ( uparrow q );

then reconsider x1 = x as (Element of L);
q <= x1 by A8,WAYBEL_0:18;
then p <= x1 by A3,ORDERS_2:3;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:18;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
( "/\" (( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ),L) ) <> p by A1,CKB24:1;
hence p < q by A3,ORDERS_2:def 6;
A9: q is_<=_than ( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ) by A2,YELLOW_0:def 10;
thus (for s being (Element of L) holds (p < s implies q <= s))
proof
let s being (Element of L);
assume A10: p < s;
then p <= s by ORDERS_2:def 6;
then A11: s in ( uparrow p ) by WAYBEL_0:18;
(not s in { p }) by A10,TARSKI:def 1;

( uparrow p ) c= ( { p } \/ ( uparrow q ) )
proof
let x being set;
assume A12: x in ( uparrow p );
then reconsider x1 = x as (Element of L);
(p = x1 or (x1 in ( uparrow p ) & (not x1 in { p }))) by A12,TARSKI:def 1;
then (p = x1 or x1 in ( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } )) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then (p = x1 or ( "/\" (( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ),L) ) <= x1) by A9,LATTICE3:def 8;
then (x in { p } or x in ( uparrow q )) by TARSKI:def 1,WAYBEL_0:18;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
hence ( uparrow p ) = ( { p } \/ ( uparrow q ) ) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;

thus ((ex q being (Element of L) st ((p < q & (for s being (Element of L) holds (p < s implies q <= s))) & ( uparrow p ) = ( { p } \/ ( uparrow q ) ))) implies p is  completely-irreducible)
proof
given q being (Element of L) such that
A13: p < q
and
A14: (for s being (Element of L) holds (p < s implies q <= s))
and
A15: ( uparrow p ) = ( { p } \/ ( uparrow q ) );

A16: (not q in { p }) by A13,TARSKI:def 1;
(ex q being (Element of L) st (( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ) is_>=_than q & (for b being (Element of L) holds (( ( uparrow p ) \ { p } ) is_>=_than b implies q >= b))))
proof
take q;
now
let a being (Element of L);
