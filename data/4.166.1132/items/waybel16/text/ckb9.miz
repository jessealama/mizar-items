let S being  complete non  empty Poset;
let T being  complete non  empty Poset;
mode CLHomomorphism of S,T

means it is  directed-sups-preserving  infs-preserving;
existence
proof
reconsider f = ( (the carrier of S) --> ( Top T ) ) as (Function of (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T));
reconsider f as (Function of S,T);
take f;
now
let X being (Subset of S);
assume A1: X is non  empty  directed;
now
assume  ex_sup_of X,S;
( rng f ) = { ( Top T ) } by FUNCOP_1:8;
then A2: ( f .: X ) c= { ( Top T ) } by RELAT_1:111;
now
let x being (Element of S);
let y being (Element of S);
assume x <= y;
( f . x ) = ( Top T ) by FUNCOP_1:7
.= ( f . y ) by FUNCOP_1:7;
hence ( f . x ) <= ( f . y );
end;
then f is  monotone by WAYBEL_1:def 2;
then A3: ( f .: X ) is non  empty  finite  directed non  empty  finite  directed (Subset of T) by A1,A2,YELLOW_2:15;
hence  ex_sup_of ( f .: X ),T by WAYBEL_0:75;
( sup ( f .: X ) ) in ( f .: X ) by A3,WAYBEL_3:16;
then ( sup ( f .: X ) ) = ( Top T ) by A2,TARSKI:def 1;
hence ( sup ( f .: X ) ) = ( f . ( sup X ) ) by FUNCOP_1:7;
end;
hence f preserves_sup_of X by WAYBEL_0:def 31;
end;
hence f is  directed-sups-preserving by WAYBEL_0:def 37;
now
let X being (Subset of S);
now
assume  ex_inf_of X,S;
thus  ex_inf_of ( f .: X ),T by YELLOW_0:17;
( rng f ) = { ( Top T ) } by FUNCOP_1:8;
then A4: ( f .: X ) is (Subset of { ( Top T ) }) by RELAT_1:111;
now
per cases ;
suppose ( f .: X ) = ( {} );

hence ( inf ( f .: X ) ) = ( Top T ) by YELLOW_0:def 12
.= ( f . ( inf X ) ) by FUNCOP_1:7;
end;
suppose ( f .: X ) <> ( {} );

then ( f .: X ) = { ( Top T ) } by A4,ZFMISC_1:33;
hence ( inf ( f .: X ) ) = ( Top T ) by YELLOW_0:39
.= ( f . ( inf X ) ) by FUNCOP_1:7;
end;
end;
hence ( inf ( f .: X ) ) = ( f . ( inf X ) );
end;
hence f preserves_inf_of X by WAYBEL_0:def 30;
end;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:def 32;
