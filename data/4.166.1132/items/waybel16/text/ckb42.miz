theorem
(for L being  complete  algebraic LATTICE holds (for p being (Element of L) holds ((ex k being (Element of L) st (k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) & p is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) ))) iff p is  completely-irreducible)))
proof
let L being  complete  algebraic LATTICE;
let p being (Element of L);
thus ((ex k being (Element of L) st (k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) & p is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) ))) implies p is  completely-irreducible) by CKB32:1;
thus (p is  completely-irreducible implies (ex k being (Element of L) st (k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) & p is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) ))))
proof
defpred P[ (Element of L) ]
 means
($1 in ( uparrow p ) & (ex k being (Element of L) st (k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) & $1 is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) ))));
reconsider A = { x where x is (Element of L): P[ x ] } as (Subset of L) from DOMAIN_1:sch 7;
assume A1: p is  completely-irreducible;
then p = ( inf A ) by CKB41:1;
then p in A by A1,CKB40:1;
then consider x being (Element of L) such that A2: x = p and x in ( uparrow p ) and A3: (ex k being (Element of L) st (k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) & x is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) )));
consider k being (Element of L) such that A4: k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) and A5: x is_maximal_in ( (the carrier of L) \ ( uparrow k ) ) by A3;
take k;
thus k in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt L )) by A4;
thus thesis by A2,A5;
