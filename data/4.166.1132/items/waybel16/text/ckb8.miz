theorem
(for L being non empty  reflexive  transitive RelStr holds ( Ids L ) = ( Filt ( L opp ) ))
proof
let L being non empty  reflexive  transitive RelStr;
A1: ( Filt ( L opp ) ) c= ( Ids L )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( Filt ( L opp ) );
then x in { X where X is (Filter of ( L opp )): (not contradiction) } by WAYBEL_0:def 24;
then consider x1 being (Filter of ( L opp )) such that A2: x1 = x;
(x1 is  lower  lower (Subset of L) & x1 is  directed  directed (Subset of L)) by YELLOW_7:26,YELLOW_7:28;
then x in { X where X is (Ideal of L): (not contradiction) } by A2;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:def 23;
