theorem
Th34: ((R is  closed & S is  closed) implies ( Cl ( R /\ S ) ) = ( ( Cl R ) /\ ( Cl S ) ))
proof
assume that
A1: R is  closed
and
A2: S is  closed;
A3: S = ( Cl S ) by A2,PRE_TOPC:22;
A4: ( Cl ( R /\ S ) ) c= ( ( Cl R ) /\ ( Cl S ) ) by PRE_TOPC:21;
R = ( Cl R ) by A1,PRE_TOPC:22;
then ( ( Cl R ) /\ ( Cl S ) ) c= ( Cl ( R /\ S ) ) by A3,PRE_TOPC:18;
hence thesis by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
