theorem
Lm1: ( Fr K ) c= ( ( ( Fr ( K \/ L ) ) \/ ( Fr ( K /\ L ) ) ) \/ ( ( Fr K ) /\ ( Fr L ) ) )
proof
let x;
A1: ( ( L ` ) /\ ( K ` ) ) = ( ( K \/ L ) ` ) by XBOOLE_1:53;
assume A2: x in ( Fr K );
then reconsider x99 = x as (Point of TS);
A3: TS is non  empty by A2;
assume A4: (not x in ( ( ( Fr ( K \/ L ) ) \/ ( Fr ( K /\ L ) ) ) \/ ( ( Fr K ) /\ ( Fr L ) ) ));
then A5: (not x99 in ( ( Fr ( K \/ L ) ) \/ ( Fr ( K /\ L ) ) )) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then (not x99 in ( Fr ( K \/ L ) )) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then consider Q1 being (Subset of TS) such that A6: Q1 is  open and A7: x99 in Q1 and A8: (( K \/ L ) misses Q1 or ( ( K \/ L ) ` ) misses Q1) by A3,CKB45:1;
(( ( K \/ L ) /\ Q1 ) = ( {} ) or ( ( ( K \/ L ) ` ) /\ Q1 ) = ( {} )) by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A9: (( ( K /\ Q1 ) \/ ( Q1 /\ L ) ) = ( {} ) or ( ( L ` ) /\ ( ( K ` ) /\ Q1 ) ) = ( {} )) by A1,XBOOLE_1:16,XBOOLE_1:23;
(not x99 in ( ( Fr K ) /\ ( Fr L ) )) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then (not x99 in ( Fr L )) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider Q3 being (Subset of TS) such that A10: Q3 is  open and A11: x99 in Q3 and A12: (L misses Q3 or ( L ` ) misses Q3) by A3,CKB45:1;
K meets Q1 by A2,A3,A6,A7,CKB45:1;
then A13: ( K /\ Q1 ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
A14:now
assume ( L /\ Q3 ) = ( {} );
then Q3 misses ( ( L ` ) ` ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A15: Q3 c= ( L ` ) by SUBSET_1:24;
( ( ( K ` ) /\ Q1 ) /\ ( ( L ` ) /\ Q3 ) ) = ( ( {} ) /\ Q3 ) by A9,A13,XBOOLE_1:16;
then ( ( ( K ` ) /\ Q1 ) /\ Q3 ) = ( {} ) by A15,XBOOLE_1:28;
hence ( ( K ` ) /\ ( Q1 /\ Q3 ) ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_1:16;
end;
A16: ( ( L ` ) \/ ( K ` ) ) = ( ( K /\ L ) ` ) by XBOOLE_1:54;
(not x99 in ( Fr ( K /\ L ) )) by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then consider Q2 being (Subset of TS) such that A17: Q2 is  open and A18: x99 in Q2 and A19: (( K /\ L ) misses Q2 or ( ( K /\ L ) ` ) misses Q2) by A3,CKB45:1;
(( ( K /\ L ) /\ Q2 ) = ( {} ) or ( ( ( K /\ L ) ` ) /\ Q2 ) = ( {} )) by A19,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A20: (( ( K /\ Q2 ) /\ L ) = ( {} ) or ( ( ( K ` ) /\ Q2 ) \/ ( Q2 /\ ( L ` ) ) ) = ( {} )) by A16,XBOOLE_1:16,XBOOLE_1:23;
x99 in ( Q1 /\ Q3 ) by A7,A11,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then ( K ` ) meets ( Q1 /\ Q3 ) by A2,A3,A6,A10,CKB45:1;
then A21: Q3 c= L by A12,A14,SUBSET_1:24,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
( K ` ) meets Q2 by A2,A3,A17,A18,CKB45:1;
then ( ( K ` ) /\ Q2 ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then ( ( K /\ ( Q2 /\ L ) ) /\ Q3 ) = ( ( {} ) /\ Q3 ) by A20,XBOOLE_1:16;
then ( K /\ ( ( Q2 /\ L ) /\ Q3 ) ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_1:16;
then ( K /\ ( Q2 /\ ( L /\ Q3 ) ) ) = ( {} ) by XBOOLE_1:16;
then ( K /\ ( Q2 /\ Q3 ) ) = ( {} ) by A21,XBOOLE_1:28;
then A22: K misses ( Q2 /\ Q3 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
x99 in ( Q2 /\ Q3 ) by A18,A11,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence contradiction by A2,A3,A17,A10,A22,CKB45:1;
