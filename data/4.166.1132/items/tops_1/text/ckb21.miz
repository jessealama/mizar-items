theorem
Th40: (Q is  open implies ( Q /\ ( Cl K ) ) c= ( Cl ( Q /\ K ) ))
proof
assume A1: Q is  open;
let x;
assume A2: x in ( Q /\ ( Cl K ) );
then A3: x in ( Cl K ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
reconsider p99 = x as (Point of TS) by A2;
A4: TS is non  empty by A2;
A5: x in Q by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
(for Q1 being (Subset of TS) holds (Q1 is  open implies (p99 in Q1 implies ( Q /\ K ) meets Q1)))
proof
let Q1 being (Subset of TS);
assume A6: Q1 is  open;
assume p99 in Q1;
then p99 in ( Q1 /\ Q ) by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then K meets ( Q1 /\ Q ) by A1,A3,A4,A6,CKB20:1;
then A7: ( K /\ ( Q1 /\ Q ) ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
( K /\ ( Q1 /\ Q ) ) = ( ( Q /\ K ) /\ Q1 ) by XBOOLE_1:16;
hence thesis by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
