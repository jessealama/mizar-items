theorem
Th61: (for GX being non empty TopSpace holds (for R being (Subset of GX) holds (for p being (Point of GX) holds (p in ( Fr R ) iff (for S being (Subset of GX) holds ((S is  open & p in S) implies (R meets S & ( R ` ) meets S)))))))
proof
let GX being non empty TopSpace;
let R being (Subset of GX);
let p being (Point of GX);
hereby
assume A1: p in ( Fr R );
then A2: p in ( Cl ( R ` ) ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
let S being (Subset of GX);
assume that
A3: S is  open
and
A4: p in S;
p in ( Cl R ) by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence (R meets S & ( R ` ) meets S) by A3,A4,A2,CKB20:1;
end;
assume A5: (for S being (Subset of GX) holds ((S is  open & p in S) implies (R meets S & ( R ` ) meets S)));
then (for S being (Subset of GX) holds ((S is  open & p in S) implies ( R ` ) meets S));
then A6: p in ( Cl ( R ` ) ) by CKB20:1;
(for S being (Subset of GX) holds ((S is  open & p in S) implies R meets S)) by A5;
then p in ( Cl R ) by CKB20:1;
hence thesis by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
