theorem
(for X being BCK-algebra holds (for A,I being (Ideal of X) holds (( A /\ I ) = { ( 0. X ) } iff (for x being (Element of A) holds (for y being (Element of I) holds ( x \ y ) = x)))))
proof
let X being BCK-algebra;
let A being (Ideal of X),I being (Ideal of X);
thus (( A /\ I ) = { ( 0. X ) } implies (for x being (Element of A) holds (for y being (Element of I) holds ( x \ y ) = x)))
proof
assume A1: ( A /\ I ) = { ( 0. X ) };
let x being (Element of A);
let y being (Element of I);
( ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) \ y ) = ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:1;
then ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) <= y by BCIALG_1:def 11;
then A2: ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) in I by CKB6:1;
( ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) \ x ) = ( ( x \ x ) \ ( x \ y ) ) by BCIALG_1:7
.= ( ( x \ y ) ` ) by BCIALG_1:def 5
.= ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:def 8;
then ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) <= x by BCIALG_1:def 11;
then ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) in A by CKB6:1;
then ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) in { ( 0. X ) } by A1,A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A3: ( x \ ( x \ y ) ) = ( 0. X ) by TARSKI:def 1;
( ( x \ y ) \ x ) = ( ( x \ x ) \ y ) by BCIALG_1:7
.= ( y ` ) by BCIALG_1:def 5
.= ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:def 8;
hence thesis by A3,BCIALG_1:def 7;
end;

thus ((for x being (Element of A) holds (for y being (Element of I) holds ( x \ y ) = x)) implies ( A /\ I ) = { ( 0. X ) })
proof
assume A4: (for x being (Element of A) holds (for y being (Element of I) holds ( x \ y ) = x));
thus ( A /\ I ) c= { ( 0. X ) }
proof
let x being set;
assume A5: x in ( A /\ I );
then reconsider xxx = x as (Element of A) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
reconsider xx = x as (Element of I) by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
( xxx \ xx ) = xxx by A4;
then x = ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:def 5;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 1;
end;

let x being set;
assume x in { ( 0. X ) };
then A6: x = ( 0. X ) by TARSKI:def 1;
(( 0. X ) in A & ( 0. X ) in I) by BCIALG_1:def 18;
hence thesis by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
