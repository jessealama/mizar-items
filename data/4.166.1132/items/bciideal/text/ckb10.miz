reserve X for BCI-algebra;
reserve x for (Element of X);
theorem
(( AtomSet X ) is (Ideal of X) implies (for x being (Element of ( BCK-part X )) holds (for a being (Element of ( AtomSet X )) holds (( x \ a ) in ( AtomSet X ) implies x = ( 0. X )))))
proof
set B = ( BCK-part X );
set P = ( AtomSet X );
A1: (x in { ( 0. X ) } iff x in ( B /\ P ))
proof
(( 0. X ) in B & ( 0. X ) in P) by BCIALG_1:19;
then ( 0. X ) in ( B /\ P ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence (x in { ( 0. X ) } implies x in ( B /\ P )) by TARSKI:def 1;
thus (x in ( B /\ P ) implies x in { ( 0. X ) })
proof
assume A2: x in ( B /\ P );
then x in B by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then (ex x1 being (Element of X) st (x = x1 & ( 0. X ) <= x1));
then A3: ( ( 0. X ) \ x ) = ( 0. X ) by BCIALG_1:def 11;
x in { x2 where x2 is (Element of X): x2 is  minimal } by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then (ex x2 being (Element of X) st (x = x2 & x2 is  minimal));
then ( 0. X ) = x by A3,BCIALG_1:def 14;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 1;
end;

end;
assume A4: P is (Ideal of X);
(for x being (Element of B) holds (for a being (Element of P) holds (( x \ a ) in P implies x = ( 0. X ))))
proof
let x being (Element of B);
let a being (Element of P);
assume ( x \ a ) in P;
then x in P by A4,BCIALG_1:def 18;
then x in ( B /\ P ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then x in { ( 0. X ) } by A1;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 1;
end;
hence thesis;
