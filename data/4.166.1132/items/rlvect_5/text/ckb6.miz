theorem
Th6: (for L being (Linear_Combination of V) holds (for F being (FinSequence of (the carrier of V)) holds (( Carrier L ) misses ( rng F ) implies ( Sum ( L (#) F ) ) = ( 0. V ))))
proof
let L being (Linear_Combination of V);
defpred P[ FinSequence ]
 means
(for G being (FinSequence of (the carrier of V)) holds (G = $1 implies (( Carrier L ) misses ( rng G ) implies ( Sum ( L (#) G ) ) = ( 0. V ))));
A1: (for p being FinSequence holds (for x holds (P[ p ] implies P[ ( p ^ <* x *> ) ])))
proof
let p being FinSequence;
let x;
assume that
A2: P[ p ];
let G being (FinSequence of (the carrier of V));
assume A3: G = ( p ^ <* x *> );
then reconsider p,x9 = <* x *> as (FinSequence of (the carrier of V)) by FINSEQ_1:36;
x in { x } by TARSKI:def 1;
then A4: x in ( rng x9 ) by FINSEQ_1:38;
( rng x9 ) c= (the carrier of V) by FINSEQ_1:def 4;
then reconsider x as (VECTOR of V) by A4;
assume ( Carrier L ) misses ( rng G );
then A5: ( {} ) = ( ( Carrier L ) /\ ( rng G ) ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7
.= ( ( Carrier L ) /\ ( ( rng p ) \/ ( rng <* x *> ) ) ) by A3,FINSEQ_1:31
.= ( ( Carrier L ) /\ ( ( rng p ) \/ { x } ) ) by FINSEQ_1:38
.= ( ( ( Carrier L ) /\ ( rng p ) ) \/ ( ( Carrier L ) /\ { x } ) ) by XBOOLE_1:23;
then ( ( Carrier L ) /\ ( rng p ) ) = ( {} );
then ( Carrier L ) misses ( rng p ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then A6: ( Sum ( L (#) p ) ) = ( 0. V ) by A2;
A7: ( ( Carrier L ) /\ { x } ) = ( {} ) by A5;
now
A8: x in { x } by TARSKI:def 1;
assume x in ( Carrier L );
hence contradiction by A7,A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
then A9: ( L . x ) = ( 0 ) by RLVECT_2:19;
( Sum ( L (#) G ) ) = ( Sum ( ( L (#) p ) ^ ( L (#) x9 ) ) ) by A3,RLVECT_3:34
.= ( ( Sum ( L (#) p ) ) + ( Sum ( L (#) x9 ) ) ) by RLVECT_1:41
.= ( ( 0. V ) + ( Sum <* ( ( L . x ) * x ) *> ) ) by A6,RLVECT_2:26
.= ( Sum <* ( ( L . x ) * x ) *> ) by RLVECT_1:4
.= ( ( 0 ) * x ) by A9,RLVECT_1:44
.= ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:10;
hence thesis;
end;
A10: P[ ( {} ) ]
proof
let G being (FinSequence of (the carrier of V));
assume G = ( {} );
then A11: ( L (#) G ) = ( <*> (the carrier of V) ) by RLVECT_2:25;
assume ( Carrier L ) misses ( rng G );
thus thesis by A11,RLVECT_1:43;
end;
A12: (for p being FinSequence holds P[ p ]) from FINSEQ_1:sch 3(A10,A1);
let F being (FinSequence of (the carrier of V));
assume ( Carrier L ) misses ( rng F );
hence thesis by A12;
