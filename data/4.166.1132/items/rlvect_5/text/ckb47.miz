definition
let V being  finite-dimensional RealLinearSpace;
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
func n Subspaces_of V -> set
means
:Def4: (x in it iff (ex W being  strict (Subspace of V) st (W = x & ( dim W ) = n)));
existence
proof
set S = { ( Lin A ) where A is (Subset of V): (A is  linearly-independent & ( card A ) = n) };
take S;
(x in S iff (ex W being  strict (Subspace of V) st (W = x & ( dim W ) = n)))
proof
hereby
assume x in S;
then A1: (ex A being (Subset of V) st ((x = ( Lin A ) & A is  linearly-independent) & ( card A ) = n));
then reconsider W = x as  strict (Subspace of V);
( dim W ) = n by A1,CKB36:1;
hence (ex W being  strict (Subspace of V) st (W = x & ( dim W ) = n));
end;
given W being  strict (Subspace of V) such that
A2: W = x
and
A3: ( dim W ) = n;

consider A being  finite (Subset of W) such that A4: A is (Basis of W) by CKB24:def 1;
reconsider A as (Subset of W);
A is  linearly-independent by A4,RLVECT_3:def 3;
then reconsider B = A as  linearly-independent (Subset of V) by CKB15:1;
A5: x = ( Lin A ) by A2,A4,RLVECT_3:def 3
.= ( Lin B ) by CKB21:1;
then ( card B ) = n by A2,A3,CKB36:1;
hence thesis by A5;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let S1 being set,S2 being set;
assume that
A6: (x in S1 iff (ex W being  strict (Subspace of V) st (W = x & ( dim W ) = n)))
and
A7: (x in S2 iff (ex W being  strict (Subspace of V) st (W = x & ( dim W ) = n)));
(for x being set holds (x in S1 iff x in S2))
proof
let x being set;
hereby
assume x in S1;
then (ex W being  strict (Subspace of V) st (W = x & ( dim W ) = n)) by A6;
hence x in S2 by A7;
end;
assume x in S2;
then (ex W being  strict (Subspace of V) st (W = x & ( dim W ) = n)) by A7;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
