begin
reserve x for (Element of ( REAL+ ));
reserve y for (Element of ( REAL+ ));
theorem
Th4: ((x <=' y & y <=' x) implies x = y)
proof
assume x <=' y;
then consider z1 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A1: ( x + z1 ) = y by ARYTM_2:9;
assume y <=' x;
then consider z2 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A2: ( y + z2 ) = x by ARYTM_2:9;
x = ( x + ( z1 + z2 ) ) by A1,A2,ARYTM_2:6;
then z1 = ( {} ) by CKB1:1,ARYTM_2:5;
hence thesis by A1,ARYTM_2:def 8;
