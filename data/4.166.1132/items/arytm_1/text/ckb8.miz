reserve x for (Element of ( REAL+ ));
reserve y for (Element of ( REAL+ ));
reserve z for (Element of ( REAL+ ));
theorem
Th7: (x <=' y iff ( x + z ) <=' ( y + z ))
proof
thus (x <=' y implies ( x + z ) <=' ( y + z ))
proof
assume x <=' y;
then consider z0 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A1: ( x + z0 ) = y by ARYTM_2:9;
( ( x + z ) + z0 ) = ( y + z ) by A1,ARYTM_2:6;
hence thesis by ARYTM_2:19;
end;

assume ( x + z ) <=' ( y + z );
then consider z0 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A2: ( ( x + z ) + z0 ) = ( y + z ) by ARYTM_2:9;
( y + z ) = ( ( x + z0 ) + z ) by A2,ARYTM_2:6;
hence thesis by ARYTM_2:11,ARYTM_2:19;
