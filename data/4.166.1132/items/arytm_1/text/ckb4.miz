begin
reserve x for (Element of ( REAL+ ));
reserve y for (Element of ( REAL+ ));
reserve z for (Element of ( REAL+ ));
theorem
Th3: ((x <=' y & y <=' z) implies x <=' z)
proof
assume x <=' y;
then consider z1 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A1: ( x + z1 ) = y by ARYTM_2:9;
assume y <=' z;
then consider z2 being (Element of ( REAL+ )) such that A2: ( y + z2 ) = z by ARYTM_2:9;
z = ( x + ( z1 + z2 ) ) by A1,A2,ARYTM_2:6;
hence thesis by ARYTM_2:19;
