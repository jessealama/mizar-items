theorem
(for c being (Object of C) holds (c is  initial iff ( c opp ) is  terminal))
proof
let c being (Object of C);
thus (c is  initial implies ( c opp ) is  terminal)
proof
assume A1: c is  initial;
let b being (Object of ( C opp ));
consider f being (Morphism of c,( opp b )) such that A2: (for g being (Morphism of c,( opp b )) holds f = g) by A1,CAT_1:def 13;
A3: ( ( opp b ) opp ) = b;
A4: ( Hom (c,( opp b )) ) <> ( {} ) by A1,CAT_1:def 13;
then reconsider f9 = ( f opp ) as (Morphism of b,( c opp )) by A3,CKB20:1;
(ex f being (Morphism of C) st f in ( Hom (c,( opp b )) )) by A4,SUBSET_1:4;
hence A5: ( Hom (b,( c opp )) ) <> ( {} ) by A3,CKB18:1;
take f9;
let g being (Morphism of b,( c opp ));
( opp ( c opp ) ) = c;
then ( opp g ) is (Morphism of c,( opp b )) by A5,CKB21:1;
hence thesis by A2;
end;

assume A6: ( c opp ) is  terminal;
let b being (Object of C);
consider f being (Morphism of ( b opp ),( c opp )) such that A7: (for g being (Morphism of ( b opp ),( c opp )) holds f = g) by A6,CAT_1:def 12;
A8: (( opp ( c opp ) ) = c & ( opp ( b opp ) ) = b);
A9: ( Hom (( b opp ),( c opp )) ) <> ( {} ) by A6,CAT_1:def 12;
then reconsider f9 = ( opp f ) as (Morphism of c,b) by A8,CKB21:1;
(ex f being (Morphism of ( C opp )) st f in ( Hom (( b opp ),( c opp )) )) by A9,SUBSET_1:4;
hence A10: ( Hom (c,b) ) <> ( {} ) by A8,CKB19:1;
take f9;
let g being (Morphism of c,b);
( g opp ) is (Morphism of ( b opp ),( c opp )) by A10,CKB20:1;
