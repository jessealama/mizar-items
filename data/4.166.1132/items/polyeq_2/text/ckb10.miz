theorem
Th2: (for a,b,c,x,y being  real number holds ((a <> ( 0 ) & y = ( x + ( 1 / x ) )) implies (( Polynom (a,b,c,b,a,x) ) = ( 0 ) implies (x <> ( 0 ) & ( ( ( ( a * ( y ^2 ) ) + ( b * y ) ) + c ) - ( 2 * a ) ) = ( 0 )))))
proof
let a being  real number;
let b being  real number;
let c being  real number;
let x being  real number;
let y being  real number;
assume that
A1: a <> ( 0 )
and
A2: y = ( x + ( 1 / x ) );
assume A3: ( Polynom (a,b,c,b,a,x) ) = ( 0 );
A4: x <> ( 0 )
proof
assume x = ( 0 );
then ( ( ( a * ( ( 0 ) to_power 4 ) ) + ( b * ( ( 0 ) |^ 3 ) ) ) + a ) = ( 0 ) by A3;
then ( ( ( a * ( 0 ) ) + ( b * ( ( 0 ) |^ 3 ) ) ) + a ) = ( 0 ) by POWER:def 2;
then ( ( ( a * ( 0 ) ) + ( b * ( 0 ) ) ) + a ) = ( 0 ) by NEWTON:11;
hence contradiction by A1;
