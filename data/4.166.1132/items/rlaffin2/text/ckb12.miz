theorem
Th8: ( conv A ) = ( union { ( Int B ): B c= A } )
proof
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
(for S being  finite (Subset of V) holds (( card S ) <= $1 implies ( conv S ) = ( union { ( Int B ): B c= S } )));
set I = { ( Int B ): B c= A };
A1: (for A being (Subset of V) holds ( union { ( Int B ): B c= A } ) c= ( conv A ))
proof
let A being (Subset of V);
set I = { ( Int B ): B c= A };
let y;
assume y in ( union I );
then consider x such that A2: y in x and A3: x in I by TARSKI:def 4;
consider B being (Subset of V) such that A4: x = ( Int B ) and A5: B c= A by A3;
A6: ( conv B ) c= ( conv A ) by A5,RLAFFIN1:3;
y in ( conv B ) by A2,A4,CKB6:def 1;
hence thesis by A6;
end;
A7: (for n being Nat holds (P[ n ] implies P[ ( n + 1 ) ]))
proof
let n being Nat;
assume that
A8: P[ n ];
let S being  finite (Subset of V);
assume that
A9: ( card S ) <= ( n + 1 );
per cases  by A9,NAT_1:8;
suppose ( card S ) <= n;

hence thesis by A8;
end;
suppose A10: ( card S ) = ( n + 1 );

set I = { ( Int B ): B c= S };
A11: ( conv S ) c= ( union I )
proof
let x;
assume that
A12: x in ( conv S );
per cases ;
suppose (for A being (Subset of V) holds (A c< S implies (not x in ( conv A ))));

then (( Int S ) in I & x in ( Int S )) by A12,CKB6:def 1;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 4;
end;
suppose (ex A being (Subset of V) st (A c< S & x in ( conv A )));

then consider A being (Subset of V) such that A13: A c< S and A14: x in ( conv A );
A15: A c= S by A13,XBOOLE_0:def 8;
then reconsider A as  finite (Subset of V);
( card A ) < ( n + 1 ) by A10,A13,CARD_2:48;
then ( card A ) <= n by NAT_1:13;
then ( conv A ) = ( union { ( Int B ): B c= A } ) by A8;
then consider Y being set such that A16: x in Y and A17: Y in { ( Int B ): B c= A } by A14,TARSKI:def 4;
consider B being (Subset of V) such that A18: Y = ( Int B ) and A19: B c= A by A17;
B c= S by A15,A19,XBOOLE_1:1;
then ( Int B ) in I;
hence thesis by A16,A18,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
end;
( union I ) c= ( conv S ) by A1;
hence thesis by A11,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
end;
A20: P[ (( 0 ) qua Nat) ]
proof
let A being  finite (Subset of V);
set I = { ( Int B ): B c= A };
assume ( card A ) <= ( 0 );
then A is  empty;
then A21: ( conv A ) is  empty;
( union I ) c= ( conv A ) by A1;
hence thesis by A21;
end;
A22: (for n being Nat holds P[ n ]) from NAT_1:sch 2(A20,A7);
hereby
let x;
assume that
A23: x in ( conv A );
reconsider A1 = A as non  empty (Subset of V) by A23;
( conv A ) = { ( Sum L ) where L is (Convex_Combination of A1): L in ( ConvexComb V ) } by CONVEX3:5;
then consider L being (Convex_Combination of A1) such that A24: (x = ( Sum L ) & L in ( ConvexComb V )) by A23;
reconsider C = ( Carrier L ) as non  empty  finite (Subset of V) by CONVEX1:21;
reconsider K = L as (Linear_Combination of C) by RLVECT_2:def 6;
K is  convex;
then x in { ( Sum M ) where M is (Convex_Combination of C): M in ( ConvexComb V ) } by A24;
then A25: x in ( conv C ) by CONVEX3:5;
P[ ( card C ) ] by A22;
then x in ( union { ( Int B ): B c= C } ) by A25;
then consider y such that A26: x in y and A27: y in { ( Int B ): B c= C } by TARSKI:def 4;
consider B being (Subset of V) such that A28: y = ( Int B ) and A29: B c= C by A27;
C c= A by RLVECT_2:def 6;
then B c= A by A29,XBOOLE_1:1;
then ( Int B ) in I;
hence x in ( union I ) by A26,A28,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
thus thesis by A1;
end;
