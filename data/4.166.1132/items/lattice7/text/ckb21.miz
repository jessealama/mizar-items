theorem
Lm1: (for L being  finite  distributive LATTICE holds (for a being (Element of L) holds ((for b being (Element of L) holds (b < a implies ( sup ( ( downarrow b ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ) ) = b)) implies ( sup ( ( downarrow a ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ) ) = a)))
proof
let L being  finite  distributive LATTICE;
let a being (Element of L);
assume A1: (for b being (Element of L) holds (b < a implies ( sup ( ( downarrow b ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ) ) = b));
thus ( sup ( ( downarrow a ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ) ) = a
proof
per cases ;
suppose A2: a = ( Bottom L );

A3: ( { ( Bottom L ) } /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ) = ( {} )
proof
set x = the (Element of ( { ( Bottom L ) } /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ));
assume A4: ( { ( Bottom L ) } /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ) <> ( {} );
then x in { ( Bottom L ) } by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A5: x = ( Bottom L ) by TARSKI:def 1;
x in ( Join-IRR L ) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
hence contradiction by A5,CKB19:1;
end;
( downarrow a ) = { ( Bottom L ) } by A2,WAYBEL_4:23;
hence thesis by A2,A3,YELLOW_0:def 11;
end;
suppose ((not a in ( Join-IRR L )) & a <> ( Bottom L ));

then consider y,z being (Element of L) such that A6: a = ( y "\/" z ) and A7: a <> y and A8: a <> z;
A9: y <= a by A6,YELLOW_0:22;
then A10: y < a by A7,ORDERS_2:def 6;
A11: ( ( downarrow a ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ) c= ( ( ( downarrow y ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ) \/ ( ( downarrow z ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ) )
proof
let x being (Element of L);
set x1 = x;
set y1 = y;
set a1 = a;
set z1 = z;
assume A12: x in ( ( downarrow a ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) );
then A13: x in ( Join-IRR L ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;

then (x1 <= y1 or x1 <= z1) by YELLOW_0:25;
then (x1 in ( downarrow y1 ) or x1 in ( downarrow z1 )) by WAYBEL_0:17;
then (x1 in ( ( downarrow y1 ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ) or x1 in ( ( downarrow z1 ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) )) by A13,XBOOLE_0:def 4;

( ( ( downarrow y ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ) \/ ( ( downarrow z ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ) ) c= ( ( downarrow a ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) )
proof

assume x in ( ( ( downarrow y ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ) \/ ( ( downarrow z ) /\ ( Join-IRR L ) ) );
hence thesis by A18;
