theorem
Th2: (for L being  finite LATTICE holds (for a,b being (Element of L) holds (a < b implies ( height a ) < ( height b ))))
proof
let L being  finite LATTICE;
let a being (Element of L),b being (Element of L);
((ex A being (Chain of ( Bottom L ),a) st ( height a ) = ( card A )) & (for C being (Chain of ( Bottom L ),a) holds ( card C ) <= ( height a ))) by CKB5:def 1;
then consider A being (Chain of ( Bottom L ),a) such that A1: ( height a ) = ( card A ) and (for C being (Chain of ( Bottom L ),a) holds ( card C ) <= ( height a ));
set C = ( A \/ { b } );
b in { b } by TARSKI:def 1;
then A2: b in C by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
A3: ( Bottom L ) <= a by YELLOW_0:44;
then ( Bottom L ) in A by CKB3:def 1;
then A4: ( Bottom L ) in C by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
assume A5: a < b;
(not b in A)
proof
assume b in A;
then b <= a by A3,CKB3:def 1;
hence contradiction by A5,ORDERS_2:6;
end;
then A6: ( card C ) = ( ( card A ) + 1 ) by CARD_2:41;
(the InternalRel of L) is_strongly_connected_in C
proof
let x being set,y being set;
((x in C & y in C) implies ([ x,y ] in (the InternalRel of L) or [ y,x ] in (the InternalRel of L)))
proof
assume A7: (x in C & y in C);
per cases  by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A8: (x in A & y in A);

then reconsider x,y as (Element of L);
(x <= y or y <= x) by A8,ORDERS_2:11;
hence thesis by ORDERS_2:def 5;
end;
suppose A9: (x in A & y in { b });

then reconsider x as (Element of L);
( Bottom L ) <= a by YELLOW_0:44;
then x <= a by A9,CKB3:def 1;
then x < b by A5,ORDERS_2:7;
then A10: x <= b by ORDERS_2:def 6;
y = b by A9,TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A10,ORDERS_2:def 5;
end;
suppose A11: (x in { b } & y in A);

then reconsider y as (Element of L);
( Bottom L ) <= a by YELLOW_0:44;
then y <= a by A11,CKB3:def 1;
then y < b by A5,ORDERS_2:7;
then A12: y <= b by ORDERS_2:def 6;
x = b by A11,TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A12,ORDERS_2:def 5;
end;
suppose A13: (x in { b } & y in { b });

then reconsider x,y as (Element of L);
x = b by A13,TARSKI:def 1;
then x <= y by A13,TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by ORDERS_2:def 5;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
then A14: C is  strongly_connected  strongly_connected (Subset of L) by ORDERS_2:def 7;
A15: (for z being (Element of L) holds (z in C implies (( Bottom L ) <= z & z <= b)))
proof
let z being (Element of L);
assume A16: z in C;
per cases  by A16,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
suppose A17: z in A;

thus ( Bottom L ) <= z by YELLOW_0:44;
z <= a by A3,A17,CKB3:def 1;
then z < b by A5,ORDERS_2:7;
hence thesis by ORDERS_2:def 6;
end;
suppose z in { b };

hence thesis by TARSKI:def 1,YELLOW_0:44;
end;
end;
( Bottom L ) <= b by YELLOW_0:44;
then C is (Chain of ( Bottom L ),b) by A4,A2,A15,A14,CKB3:def 1;
then ( ( height a ) + 1 ) <= ( height b ) by A1,A6,CKB5:def 1;
hence thesis by NAT_1:13;
end;
