definition
let L being  finite LATTICE;
let x being (Element of L);
func height x -> (Element of ( NAT )) means 
:Def3: ((ex A being (Chain of ( Bottom L ),x) st it = ( card A )) & (for A being (Chain of ( Bottom L ),x) holds ( card A ) <= it));
existence
proof
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
(ex A being (Chain of ( Bottom L ),x) st $1 = ( card A ));
A1: { ( Bottom L ),x } is (Chain of ( Bottom L ),x) by CKB4:1,YELLOW_0:44;
(ex k st (P[ k ] & (for n holds (P[ n ] implies n <= k))))
proof
P[ ( card { ( Bottom L ),x } ) ] by A1;
then A2: (ex k being Nat st P[ k ]);
A3: (for k being Nat holds (P[ k ] implies k <= ( card (the carrier of L) ))) by NAT_1:43;
consider k being Nat such that A4: (P[ k ] & (for n being Nat holds (P[ n ] implies n <= k))) from NAT_1:sch 6(A3,A2);
reconsider k as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
take k;
thus thesis by A4;
end;
then consider k such that A5: (P[ k ] & (for n holds (P[ n ] implies n <= k)));
take k;
thus thesis by A5;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let a being (Element of ( NAT ));
let b being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume (((ex A being (Chain of ( Bottom L ),x) st a = ( card A )) & ((for A being (Chain of ( Bottom L ),x) holds ( card A ) <= a) & (ex B being (Chain of ( Bottom L ),x) st b = ( card B )))) & (for A being (Chain of ( Bottom L ),x) holds ( card A ) <= b));
then (a <= b & b <= a);
hence thesis by XXREAL_0:1;
end;
