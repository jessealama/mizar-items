theorem
Th11: (for L being  finite  distributive LATTICE holds (for x being (Element of L) holds (x in ( Join-IRR L ) implies (ex z being (Element of L) st (z < x & (for y being (Element of L) holds (y < x implies y <= z)))))))
proof
let L being  finite  distributive LATTICE;
let x being (Element of L);
assume A1: x in ( Join-IRR L );
then x <> ( Bottom L ) by CKB19:1;
then consider z being (Element of L) such that A2: z <(1) x by CKB17:1;
A3: z < x by A2,CKB14:def 1;
(for y being (Element of L) holds (y < x implies y <= z))
proof
let y being (Element of L);
consider Y being set such that A4: Y = { g where g is (Element of L): (g < x & (not g <= z)) };
A5: Y is  empty
proof
A6: Y c= (the carrier of L)
proof
let f being set;
assume f in Y;
then (ex g being (Element of L) st ((g = f & g < x) & (not g <= z))) by A4;
hence thesis;
end;
assume Y is non empty;
then consider a being (Element of L) such that A7: a in Y and A8: (for b being (Element of L) holds (b in Y implies (not a < b))) by A6,CKB15:1;
A9: (for t being (Element of L) holds (t in Y iff (t < x & (not t <= z))))
proof
let t being (Element of L);
(t in Y implies (t < x & (not t <= z)))
proof
assume t in Y;
then (ex g being (Element of L) st ((g = t & g < x) & (not g <= z))) by A4;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
then A10: (not a <= z) by A7;
A11: z <= x by A3,ORDERS_2:def 6;
a < x by A9,A7;
then A12: ( a "\/" z ) <> x by A1,A3,CKB19:1;
a < x by A9,A7;
then a <= x by ORDERS_2:def 6;
then ( a "\/" z ) <= x by A11,YELLOW_5:9;
then A13: ( a "\/" z ) < x by A12,ORDERS_2:def 6;
( a "/\" a ) <= ( a "\/" z ) by YELLOW_5:5;
then A14: a <= ( a "\/" z ) by YELLOW_5:2;
a <> ( a "\/" z )
proof
assume a = ( a "\/" z );
( z "/\" z ) <= ( a "\/" z ) by YELLOW_5:5;
then z <= ( a "\/" z ) by YELLOW_5:2;
then z < ( a "\/" z ) by A10,A14,ORDERS_2:def 6;
hence contradiction by A2,A13,CKB14:def 1;
end;
then A15: ( a "\/" z ) > a by A14,ORDERS_2:def 6;
(not ( a "\/" z ) <= z) by A10,YELLOW_5:3;
then ( a "\/" z ) in Y by A9,A13;
hence contradiction by A8,A15;
end;
assume (y < x & (not y <= z));
then y in Y by A4;
hence contradiction by A5;
end;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
