theorem
Th8: (for L being  finite LATTICE holds (for X being non empty (Subset of L) holds (ex x being (Element of L) st (x in X & (for y being (Element of L) holds (y in X implies (not x < y)))))))
proof
let L being  finite LATTICE;
let X being non empty (Subset of L);
defpred P[ Nat ]
 means
(ex x being (Element of L) st (x in X & $1 = ( height x )));
(ex k st (P[ k ] & (for n holds (P[ n ] implies n <= k))))
proof
A1: (for k being Nat holds (P[ k ] implies k <= ( card (the carrier of L) )))
proof
let k being Nat;
assume P[ k ];
then consider x being (Element of L) such that x in X and A2: k = ( height x );
(ex B being (Chain of ( Bottom L ),x) st k = ( card B )) by A2,CKB5:def 1;
hence thesis by NAT_1:43;
end;
A3: (ex k being Nat st P[ k ])
proof
consider x being set such that A4: x in X by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
reconsider x as (Element of L) by A4;
(ex B being (Chain of ( Bottom L ),x) st ( height x ) = ( card B )) by CKB5:def 1;
hence thesis by A4;
end;
consider k being Nat such that A5: P[ k ] and A6: (for n being Nat holds (P[ n ] implies n <= k)) from NAT_1:sch 6(A1,A3);
(for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (P[ n ] implies n <= k)) by A6;
hence thesis by A5;
end;
then consider k such that A7: (P[ k ] & (for n holds (P[ n ] implies n <= k)));
consider x being (Element of L) such that A8: x in X and A9: (k = ( height x ) & (for n holds ((ex y being (Element of L) st (y in X & n = ( height y ))) implies n <= k))) by A7;
(for y being (Element of L) holds (y in X implies (not x < y)))
proof
let y being (Element of L);
assume that
A10: y in X
and
A11: x < y;
( height x ) < ( height y ) by A11,CKB6:1;
hence contradiction by A9,A10;
end;
hence thesis by A8;
