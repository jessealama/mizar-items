cluster  Boolean  join-idempotent  upper-bounded'  complemented'  distributive'  lower-bounded'  Lattice-like for 1 -element 1 -element LattStr;
existence
proof
set L = the 1 -element Lattice;
A1: L is  lower-bounded
proof
set x = the (Element of L);
(for y being (Element of L) holds (( x "/\" y ) = x & ( y "/\" x ) = x)) by STRUCT_0:def 10;
hence thesis by LATTICES:def 13;
end;
A2: L is  upper-bounded
proof
set x = the (Element of L);
(for y being (Element of L) holds (( x "\/" y ) = x & ( y "\/" x ) = x)) by STRUCT_0:def 10;
hence thesis by LATTICES:def 14;
end;
(for b being (Element of L) holds (ex a being (Element of L) st a is_a_complement_of b))
proof
let b being (Element of L);
take a = b;
(( b "\/" a ) = ( Top L ) & ( b "/\" a ) = ( Bottom L )) by STRUCT_0:def 10;
hence thesis by LATTICES:def 18;
end;
then A3: L is  complemented by LATTICES:def 19;
A4: L is  join-idempotent
proof
let x being (Element of L);
thus thesis by STRUCT_0:def 10;
end;
(for b being (Element of L) holds (ex a being (Element of L) st a is_a_complement'_of b))
proof
let b being (Element of L);
take a = b;
(( b "\/" a ) = ( Top' L ) & ( b "/\" a ) = ( Bot' L )) by STRUCT_0:def 10;
hence thesis by CKB7:def 1;
end;
then A5: L is  complemented' by CKB8:def 1;
(for a,b,c being (Element of L) holds ( a "/\" ( b "\/" c ) ) = ( ( a "/\" b ) "\/" ( a "/\" c ) )) by STRUCT_0:def 10;
then A6: L is  distributive by LATTICES:def 11;
A7: L is  lower-bounded'
proof
set x = the (Element of L);
(for y being (Element of L) holds (( x "\/" y ) = y & ( y "\/" x ) = y)) by STRUCT_0:def 10;
hence thesis by CKB4:def 1;
end;
A8: L is  upper-bounded'
proof
set x = the (Element of L);
(for y being (Element of L) holds (( x "/\" y ) = y & ( y "/\" x ) = y)) by STRUCT_0:def 10;
hence thesis by CKB2:def 1;
end;
(for a,b,c being (Element of L) holds ( a "\/" ( b "/\" c ) ) = ( ( a "\/" b ) "/\" ( a "\/" c ) )) by STRUCT_0:def 10;
then L is  distributive' by CKB6:def 1;
hence thesis by A3,A6,A1,A2,A4,A8,A5,A7;
