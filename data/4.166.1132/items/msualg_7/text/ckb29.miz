theorem
Th21: (for r1 holds (for r2 holds (r1 <= r2 implies ( RealSubLatt (r1,r2) ) is  complete)))
proof
let r1;
let r2;
assume that
A1: r1 <= r2;
reconsider R1 = r1,R2 = r2 as R_eal by XXREAL_0:def 1;
set A = [. r1,r2 .];
set L9 = ( RealSubLatt (r1,r2) );
A2: (the carrier of L9) = [. r1,r2 .] by A1,CKB28:def 1;
A3: (the L_meet of L9) = ( ( minreal ) || [. r1,r2 .] ) by A1,CKB28:def 1;
now
let X being (Subset of L9);
per cases ;
suppose A4: X is  empty;

thus (ex a being (Element of L9) st (a is_less_than X & (for b being (Element of L9) holds (b is_less_than X implies b [= a))))
proof
r2 in { r: (r1 <= r & r <= r2) } by A1;
then reconsider a = r2 as (Element of L9) by A2,RCOMP_1:def 1;
take a;
(for q being (Element of L9) holds (q in X implies a [= q)) by A4;
hence a is_less_than X by LATTICE3:def 16;
let b being (Element of L9);
assume b is_less_than X;
A5: b in [. r1,r2 .] by A2;
then reconsider b9 = b as (Element of ( REAL ));
b in { r: (r1 <= r & r <= r2) } by A5,RCOMP_1:def 1;

proof
set g = the (Element of X1);

LB is (LowerBound of X1)
proof
let v being  ext-real number;

proof
