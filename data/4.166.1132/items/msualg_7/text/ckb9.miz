theorem
Th9: (for X being (Subset of ( EqRelLatt M )) holds (for X1 being (SubsetFamily of [| M,M |]) holds ((X1 = X & X is non  empty) implies ( meet |: X1 :| ) is (Equivalence_Relation of M))))
proof
let X being (Subset of ( EqRelLatt M ));
let X1 being (SubsetFamily of [| M,M |]);
set a = ( meet |: X1 :| );
now
let i being set;
assume A1: i in I;
a c= [| M,M |] by PBOOLE:def 18;
then ( a . i ) c= ( [| M,M |] . i ) by A1,PBOOLE:def 2;
hence ( a . i ) is (Relation of ( M . i )) by A1,PBOOLE:def 16;
end;
then reconsider a as (ManySortedRelation of M) by MSUALG_4:def 1;
assume that
A2: X1 = X
and
A3: X is non  empty;
now
reconsider X19 = X1 as non  empty (SubsetFamily of [| M,M |]) by A2,A3;
let i being set;
let R being (Relation of ( M . i ));
assume that
A4: i in I
and
A5: ( a . i ) = R;
reconsider i9 = i as (Element of I) by A4;
reconsider b = ( |: X1 :| . i9 ) as (Subset-Family of [: ( M . i ),( M . i ) :]) by PBOOLE:def 16;
consider Q being (Subset-Family of ( [| M,M |] . i )) such that A6: Q = ( |: X1 :| . i ) and A7: R = ( Intersect Q ) by A4,A5,MSSUBFAM:def 1;
reconsider Q as (Subset-Family of [: ( M . i ),( M . i ) :]) by A4,PBOOLE:def 16;
|: X19 :| is  non-empty;
then A8: Q <> ( {} ) by A4,A6,PBOOLE:def 13;
A9: ( |: X19 :| . i ) = { ( x . i ) where x is (Element of ( Bool [| M,M |] )): x in X1 } by A4,CLOSURE2:14;
now
let Y;
assume Y in b;
then consider z being (Element of ( Bool [| M,M |] )) such that A10: Y = ( z . i ) and A11: z in X by A2,A9;
z c= [| M,M |] by PBOOLE:def 18;
then ( z . i ) c= ( [| M,M |] . i ) by A4,PBOOLE:def 2;
then reconsider Y1 = Y as (Relation of ( M . i )) by A4,A10,PBOOLE:def 16;
z is (Equivalence_Relation of M) by A11,MSUALG_5:def 5;
then Y1 is (Equivalence_Relation of ( M . i )) by A4,A10,MSUALG_4:def 2;
hence Y is (Equivalence_Relation of ( M . i ));
end;
then ( meet b ) is (Equivalence_Relation of ( M . i )) by A6,A8,EQREL_1:11;
hence R is (Equivalence_Relation of ( M . i )) by A6,A7,A8,SETFAM_1:def 9;
end;
hence thesis by MSUALG_4:def 2;
