reserve X for non empty TopSpace;
theorem
(X is  extremally_disconnected iff (for A,B being (Subset of X) holds ((A is  closed & B is  closed) implies (( A \/ B ) = (the carrier of X) implies ( ( Int A ) \/ ( Int B ) ) = (the carrier of X)))))
proof
thus (X is  extremally_disconnected implies (for A,B being (Subset of X) holds ((A is  closed & B is  closed) implies (( A \/ B ) = (the carrier of X) implies ( ( Int A ) \/ ( Int B ) ) = (the carrier of X)))))
proof
assume A1: X is  extremally_disconnected;
let A being (Subset of X),B being (Subset of X);
assume that
A2: A is  closed
and
A3: B is  closed;
assume ( A \/ B ) = (the carrier of X);
then ( ( A \/ B ) ` ) = ( {} X ) by XBOOLE_1:37;
then ( ( A ` ) /\ ( B ` ) ) = ( {} X ) by XBOOLE_1:53;
then ( A ` ) misses ( B ` ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then ( Cl ( A ` ) ) misses ( Cl ( B ` ) ) by A1,A2,A3,CKB51:1;
then ( ( Cl ( A ` ) ) /\ ( Cl ( B ` ) ) ) = ( {} X ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then ( ( ( Cl ( A ` ) ) /\ ( Cl ( B ` ) ) ) ` ) = ( [#] X );
then ( ( ( Cl ( A ` ) ) ` ) \/ ( ( Cl ( B ` ) ) ` ) ) = ( [#] X ) by XBOOLE_1:54;
then ( ( ( Cl ( A ` ) ) ` ) \/ ( Int B ) ) = ( [#] X ) by TOPS_1:def 1;
hence thesis by TOPS_1:def 1;
end;

assume A4: (for A,B being (Subset of X) holds ((A is  closed & B is  closed) implies (( A \/ B ) = (the carrier of X) implies ( ( Int A ) \/ ( Int B ) ) = (the carrier of X))));
now
let A being (Subset of X),B being (Subset of X);
assume that
A5: A is  open
and
A6: B is  open;
assume A misses B;
then ( A /\ B ) = ( {} X ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then ( ( A /\ B ) ` ) = ( [#] X );
then ( ( A ` ) \/ ( B ` ) ) = ( [#] X ) by XBOOLE_1:54;
then ( ( Int ( A ` ) ) \/ ( Int ( B ` ) ) ) = (the carrier of X) by A4,A5,A6;
then ( ( ( Int ( A ` ) ) \/ ( Int ( B ` ) ) ) ` ) = ( {} X ) by XBOOLE_1:37;
then ( ( ( Int ( A ` ) ) ` ) /\ ( ( Int ( B ` ) ) ` ) ) = ( {} X ) by XBOOLE_1:53;
then ( ( Cl A ) /\ ( ( Int ( B ` ) ) ` ) ) = ( {} X ) by CKB1:1;
then ( Cl A ) misses ( ( Int ( B ` ) ) ` ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
hence ( Cl A ) misses ( Cl B ) by CKB1:1;
end;
hence thesis by CKB51:1;
