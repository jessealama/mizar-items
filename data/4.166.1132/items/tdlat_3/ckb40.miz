theorem
((for A being (Subset of X) holds (for x being (Point of X) holds (A = { x } implies ( Cl A ) is  open))) implies X is  almost_discrete)
proof
assume A1: (for D being (Subset of X) holds (for x being (Point of X) holds (D = { x } implies ( Cl D ) is  open)));
(for A being (Subset of X) holds (A is  closed implies A is  open))
proof
let A being (Subset of X);
set F = { B where B is (Subset of X): (ex C being (Subset of X) st (ex a being (Point of X) st ((a in A & C = { a }) & B = ( Cl C )))) };
A2: ( union ( bool A ) ) = A by ZFMISC_1:81;
assume A3: A is  closed;
A4: (for C being (Subset of X) holds (for a being (Point of X) holds ((a in A & C = { a }) implies ( Cl C ) c= A)))
proof
let C being (Subset of X);
let a being (Point of X);
assume that
A5: a in A
and
A6: C = { a };
C c= A by A5,A6,ZFMISC_1:31;
then ( Cl C ) c= ( Cl A ) by PRE_TOPC:19;
hence thesis by A3,PRE_TOPC:22;
end;
A7: F c= ( bool A )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in F;
then consider P being (Subset of X) such that A8: x = P and A9: (ex C being (Subset of X) st (ex a being (Point of X) st ((a in A & C = { a }) & P = ( Cl C ))));
P c= A by A4,A9;
hence thesis by A8;
end;
( bool A ) c= ( bool (the carrier of X) ) by ZFMISC_1:67;
then reconsider F as (Subset-Family of X) by A7,XBOOLE_1:1;
now
let x being set;
assume A10: x in ( bool A );
then reconsider P = x as (Subset of X) by XBOOLE_1:1;
now
let y being set;
assume A11: y in P;
then reconsider a = y as (Point of X);
now
reconsider P0 = { a } as (Subset of X) by A11,ZFMISC_1:31;
take B = ( Cl P0 );
A12: P0 c= B by PRE_TOPC:18;
a in P0 by TARSKI:def 1;
hence (y in B & B in F) by A10,A11,A12;
end;
hence y in ( union F ) by TARSKI:def 4;
end;
hence x c= ( union F ) by TARSKI:def 3;
end;
then A13: ( union ( bool A ) ) c= ( union F );
now
let D being (Subset of X);
assume D in F;
then (ex S being (Subset of X) st (S = D & (ex C being (Subset of X) st (ex a being (Point of X) st ((a in A & C = { a }) & S = ( Cl C ))))));
hence D is  open by A1;
end;
then A14: F is  open by TOPS_2:def 1;
( union F ) c= ( union ( bool A ) ) by A7,ZFMISC_1:77;
then ( union F ) = A by A13,A2,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by A14,TOPS_2:19;
end;
hence thesis by CKB36:1;
