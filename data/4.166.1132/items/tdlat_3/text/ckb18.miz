cluster  anti-discrete ->  TopSpace-like for TopStruct;
coherence
proof
let Y being TopStruct;
assume Y is  anti-discrete;
then A4: (the topology of Y) = { ( {} ),(the carrier of Y) } by CKB11:def 1;
A5: (for A,B being (Subset of Y) holds ((A in (the topology of Y) & B in (the topology of Y)) implies ( A /\ B ) in (the topology of Y)))
proof
let A being (Subset of Y),B being (Subset of Y);
assume that
A6: A in (the topology of Y)
and
A7: B in (the topology of Y);
A8: (B = ( {} ) or B = (the carrier of Y)) by A4,A7,TARSKI:def 2;
(A = ( {} ) or A = (the carrier of Y)) by A4,A6,TARSKI:def 2;
hence thesis by A4,A8,TARSKI:def 2;
end;
A9: (for F being (Subset-Family of Y) holds (F c= (the topology of Y) implies ( union F ) in (the topology of Y)))
proof
let F being (Subset-Family of Y);
assume F c= (the topology of Y);
then (((F = ( {} ) or F = { ( {} ) }) or F = { (the carrier of Y) }) or F = { ( {} ),(the carrier of Y) }) by A4,ZFMISC_1:36;
then ((( union F ) = ( {} ) or ( union F ) = (the carrier of Y)) or ( union F ) = ( ( {} ) \/ (the carrier of Y) )) by ZFMISC_1:2,ZFMISC_1:25,ZFMISC_1:75;
hence thesis by A4,TARSKI:def 2;
end;
(the carrier of Y) in (the topology of Y) by A4,TARSKI:def 2;
hence thesis by A9,A5,PRE_TOPC:def 1;
