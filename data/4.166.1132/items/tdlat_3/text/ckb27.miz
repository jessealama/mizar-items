theorem
Th19: ((for A being (Subset of X) holds (for x being (Point of X) holds (A = { x } implies A is  open))) implies X is  discrete)
proof
assume A1: (for A being (Subset of X) holds (for x being (Point of X) holds (A = { x } implies A is  open)));
now
let A being (Subset of X);
set F = { B where B is (Subset of X): (ex a being (Point of X) st (a in A & B = { a })) };
A2: F c= ( bool A )
proof
let x being set;
assume x in F;
then consider C being (Subset of X) such that A3: x = C and A4: (ex a being (Point of X) st (a in A & C = { a }));
C c= A by A4,ZFMISC_1:31;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
( bool A ) c= ( bool (the carrier of X) ) by ZFMISC_1:67;
then reconsider F as (Subset-Family of X) by A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
A5: ( union ( bool A ) ) = A by ZFMISC_1:81;
now
let x being set;
assume A6: x in ( bool A );
then reconsider P = x as (Subset of X) by XBOOLE_1:1;
now
let y being set;
assume A7: y in P;
then reconsider a = y as (Point of X);
now
take B0 = { a };
B0 is (Subset of X) by A7,ZFMISC_1:31;
hence (y in B0 & B0 in F) by A6,A7,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
hence y in ( union F ) by TARSKI:def 4;
end;
hence x c= ( union F ) by TARSKI:def 3;
end;
then A8: ( union ( bool A ) ) c= ( union F );
now
let B being (Subset of X);
assume B in F;
then (ex C being (Subset of X) st (C = B & (ex a being (Point of X) st (a in A & C = { a }))));
hence B is  open by A1;
end;
then A9: F is  open by TOPS_2:def 1;
( union F ) c= ( union ( bool A ) ) by A2,ZFMISC_1:77;
then ( union F ) = A by A8,A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence A is  open by A9,TOPS_2:19;
end;
hence thesis by CKB25:1;
end;
