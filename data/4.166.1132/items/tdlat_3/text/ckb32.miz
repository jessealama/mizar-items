theorem
((for A being (Subset of X) holds (for x being (Point of X) holds (A = { x } implies ( Cl A ) = (the carrier of X)))) implies X is  anti-discrete)
proof
assume A1: (for A being (Subset of X) holds (for x being (Point of X) holds (A = { x } implies ( Cl A ) = (the carrier of X))));
(for B being (Subset of X) holds (B is  closed implies (B = ( {} ) or B = (the carrier of X))))
proof
let B being (Subset of X);
assume A2: B is  closed;
set z = the (Element of B);
assume A3: B <> ( {} );
then reconsider x = z as (Point of X) by TARSKI:def 3;
A4: { x } c= B by A3,ZFMISC_1:31;
then reconsider A = { x } as (Subset of X) by XBOOLE_1:1;
( Cl A ) = (the carrier of X) by A1;
then (the carrier of X) c= B by A2,A4,TOPS_1:5;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 10;

hence thesis by CKB31:1;
