let X being  discrete non empty TopSpace;

proof
let X0 being (SubSpace of X);
thus X0 is  open
proof
let A being (Subset of X);
thus thesis by CKB25:1;

thus X0 is  closed
proof
let A being (Subset of X);
thus thesis by CKB26:1;

A1: (the topology of X) = ( bool (the carrier of X) ) by CKB10:def 1;
now
let S being set;
assume S in ( bool (the carrier of X0) );
then reconsider A = S as (Subset of X0);
(the carrier of X0) c= (the carrier of X) by BORSUK_1:1;
then reconsider B = A as (Subset of X) by XBOOLE_1:1;
now
take B;
thus (B in (the topology of X) & A = ( B /\ ( [#] X0 ) )) by A1,XBOOLE_1:28;
