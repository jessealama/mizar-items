theorem
Th34: (X is  extremally_disconnected iff (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A is  condensed implies (A is  closed & A is  open))))
proof
thus (X is  extremally_disconnected implies (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A is  condensed implies (A is  closed & A is  open))))
proof
assume A1: X is  extremally_disconnected;
let A being (Subset of X);
A2: ( Cl ( Int A ) ) is  open by A1,CKB48:def 1;
assume A3: A is  condensed;
then ( Cl A ) = ( Cl ( Int A ) ) by CKB9:1;
then ( Int ( Cl A ) ) = ( Cl ( Int A ) ) by A2,TOPS_1:23;
hence thesis by A3,CKB8:1;
end;

assume A4: (for A being (Subset of X) holds (A is  condensed implies (A is  closed & A is  open)));
now
let A being (Subset of X);
assume A is  open;
then A5: ( Int A ) = A by TOPS_1:23;
( Cl ( Int A ) ) is  closed_condensed by TDLAT_1:22;
then ( Cl A ) is  condensed by A5,TOPS_1:66;
hence ( Cl A ) is  open by A4;
end;
hence thesis by CKB48:def 1;
end;
