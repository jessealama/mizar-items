theorem
Th38: (X is  extremally_disconnected iff (for A being (Subset of X) holds ((A is  open_condensed implies A is  closed_condensed) & (A is  closed_condensed implies A is  open_condensed))))
proof
thus (X is  extremally_disconnected implies (for A being (Subset of X) holds ((A is  open_condensed implies A is  closed_condensed) & (A is  closed_condensed implies A is  open_condensed))))
proof
assume A1: X is  extremally_disconnected;
let A being (Subset of X);
thus (A is  open_condensed implies A is  closed_condensed)
proof
assume A is  open_condensed;
then A is  condensed by TOPS_1:67;
hence thesis by A1,CKB56:1;
end;

thus (A is  closed_condensed implies A is  open_condensed)
proof
assume A is  closed_condensed;
then A is  condensed by TOPS_1:66;
hence thesis by A1,CKB56:1;
end;

end;

assume A2: (for A being (Subset of X) holds ((A is  open_condensed implies A is  closed_condensed) & (A is  closed_condensed implies A is  open_condensed)));
(for A being (Subset of X) holds (A is  condensed implies ( Int ( Cl A ) ) = ( Cl ( Int A ) )))
proof
let A being (Subset of X);
assume A3: A is  condensed;
then A4: A c= ( Cl ( Int A ) ) by TOPS_1:def 6;
( Cl ( Int A ) ) is  closed_condensed by TDLAT_1:22;
then ( Cl ( Int A ) ) is  open_condensed by A2;
then ( Cl ( Int A ) ) = ( Int ( Cl ( Cl ( Int A ) ) ) ) by TOPS_1:def 8;
then A5: ( Cl ( Int A ) ) c= ( Int ( Cl A ) ) by TDLAT_2:1;
( Int ( Cl A ) ) c= A by A3,TOPS_1:def 6;
then ( Int ( Cl A ) ) c= ( Cl ( Int A ) ) by A4,XBOOLE_1:1;
hence thesis by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
hence thesis by CKB57:1;
