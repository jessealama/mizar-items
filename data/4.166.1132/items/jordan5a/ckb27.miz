theorem
(for a,b,c,d being Real holds (for f being (Function of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) ),( Closed-Interval-TSpace (c,d) )) holds (for P,Q being non empty (Subset of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) )) holds (for PP,QQ being (Subset of ( R^1 )) holds (((((((((a < b & c < d) & PP = P) & QQ = Q) & f is  continuous  one-to-one) & PP is  compact) & ( f . a ) = c) & ( f . b ) = d) & ( f .: P ) = Q) implies ( f . ( upper_bound ( [#] PP ) ) ) = ( upper_bound ( [#] QQ ) ))))))
proof
let a being Real,b being Real,c being Real,d being Real;
let f being (Function of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) ),( Closed-Interval-TSpace (c,d) ));
let P being non empty (Subset of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) )),Q being non empty (Subset of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) ));
let PP being (Subset of ( R^1 )),QQ being (Subset of ( R^1 ));
assume that
A1: (a < b & c < d)
and
A2: PP = P
and
A3: QQ = Q
and
A4: f is  continuous  one-to-one
and
A5: PP is  compact
and
A6: (( f . a ) = c & ( f . b ) = d)
and
A7: ( f .: P ) = Q;
A8: ( [#] ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (c,d) ) ) = (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (c,d) ));
set IT = ( f . ( upper_bound ( [#] PP ) ) );
A9: ( [#] PP ) is  bounded by A5,WEIERSTR:11;
( [#] PP ) <> ( {} ) by A2,WEIERSTR:def 1;
then A10: ( upper_bound ( [#] PP ) ) in ( [#] PP ) by A5,A9,RCOMP_1:12,WEIERSTR:12;
then A11: ( upper_bound ( [#] PP ) ) in P by A2,WEIERSTR:def 1;
P c= (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) ));
then A12: ( [#] PP ) c= (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) )) by A2,WEIERSTR:def 1;

A14: ( [#] ( R^1 ) ) = (the carrier of ( R^1 ));
then A15: (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (c,d) )) c= (the carrier of ( R^1 )) by A8,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
then reconsider IT as Real by A13,TOPMETR:17;
( [#] ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) ) ) = (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) ));
then A16: (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) )) c= (the carrier of ( R^1 )) by A14,PRE_TOPC:def 4;
A17: (for r being  real number holds (r in ( [#] QQ ) implies IT >= r))
proof
let r being  real number;
assume r in ( [#] QQ );
then r in ( f .: P ) by A3,A7,WEIERSTR:def 1;
then r in ( f .: ( [#] PP ) ) by A2,WEIERSTR:def 1;
then consider x being set such that A18: x in ( dom f ) and A19: x in ( [#] PP ) and A20: r = ( f . x ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
reconsider x1 = x,x2 = ( upper_bound ( [#] PP ) ) as (Point of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) )) by A11,A18;
x1 in (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) ));
then reconsider r1 = x,r2 = x2 as Real by A16,TOPMETR:17;
A21: r2 >= r1 by A9,A19,SEQ_4:def 1;
(( f . x1 ) in (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (c,d) )) & ( f . x2 ) in (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (c,d) )));
then reconsider fr = ( f . x2 ),fx = ( f . x1 ) as Real by A15,TOPMETR:17;
per cases ;
suppose r2 <> r1;

then r2 > r1 by A21,XXREAL_0:1;
then fr > fx by A1,A4,A6,CKB24:1;
hence thesis by A20;
end;
suppose r2 = r1;

hence thesis by A20;
end;
end;
( [#] ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) ) ) = (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (a,b) ));
then P is  compact by A2,A5,COMPTS_1:2;
then (for P1 being (Subset of ( Closed-Interval-TSpace (c,d) )) holds (P1 = QQ implies P1 is  compact)) by A3,A4,A7,WEIERSTR:8;
then QQ is  compact by A3,A7,A8,COMPTS_1:2;
then A22: ( [#] QQ ) is  bounded by WEIERSTR:11;

then ( upper_bound ( [#] PP ) ) in ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then IT in QQ by A3,A7,A11,FUNCT_1:def 6;
then A23: IT in ( [#] QQ ) by WEIERSTR:def 1;
(for s being  real number holds (( 0 ) < s implies (ex r being  real number st (r in ( [#] QQ ) & r > ( IT - s )))))
proof
given s being  real number such that
A24: ( 0 ) < s
and
A25: (not (ex r being  real number st (r in ( [#] QQ ) & r > ( IT - s ))));

( IT - s ) < ( IT - ( 0 ) ) by A24,XREAL_1:15;
hence thesis by A23,A25;
end;
hence thesis by A22,A23,A17,SEQ_4:def 1;
