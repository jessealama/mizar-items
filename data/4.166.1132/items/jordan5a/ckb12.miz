theorem
Th7: (for f being (Function of ( R^1 ),( R^1 )) holds (for x being (Point of ( R^1 )) holds (for g being (PartFunc of ( REAL ),( REAL )) holds (for x1 being Real holds (((f is_continuous_at x & f = g) & x = x1) implies g is_continuous_in x1)))))
proof
let f being (Function of ( R^1 ),( R^1 ));
let x being (Point of ( R^1 ));
let g being (PartFunc of ( REAL ),( REAL ));
let x1 being Real;
assume that
A1: f is_continuous_at x
and
A2: f = g
and
A3: x = x1;
(for N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( g . x1 )) holds (ex N being (Neighbourhood of x1) st ( g .: N ) c= N1))
proof
reconsider fx = ( f . x ) as (Point of ( R^1 ));
let N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( g . x1 ));
reconsider N19 = N1 as (Subset of ( R^1 )) by TOPMETR:17;
reconsider N2 = N1 as (Subset of ( RealSpace )) by TOPMETR:12,TOPMETR:17,TOPMETR:def 6;
N2 in ( Family_open_set ( RealSpace ) ) by CKB9:1;
then N2 in (the topology of ( TopSpaceMetr ( RealSpace ) )) by TOPMETR:12;
then N19 is  open by PRE_TOPC:def 2,TOPMETR:def 6;
then reconsider G = N19 as (a_neighborhood of fx) by A2,A3,CONNSP_2:3,RCOMP_1:16;
consider H being (a_neighborhood of x) such that A4: ( f .: H ) c= G by A1,TMAP_1:def 2;
consider V being (Subset of ( R^1 )) such that A5: V is  open and A6: V c= H and A7: x in V by CONNSP_2:6;
reconsider V1 = V as (Subset of ( REAL )) by TOPMETR:17;
V in (the topology of ( R^1 )) by A5,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then V in ( Family_open_set ( RealSpace ) ) by TOPMETR:12,TOPMETR:def 6;
then V1 is  open by CKB10:1;
then consider N being (Neighbourhood of x1) such that A8: N c= V1 by A3,A7,RCOMP_1:18;
N c= H by A6,A8,XBOOLE_1:1;
then ( g .: N ) c= ( g .: H ) by RELAT_1:123;
hence thesis by A2,A4,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
hence thesis by FCONT_1:5;
