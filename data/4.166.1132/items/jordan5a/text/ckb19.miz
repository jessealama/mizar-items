theorem
Th13: (for a,b being Real holds (for X being (Subset of ( REAL )) holds (for V being (Subset of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) holds (V = X implies (X is  open implies V in ( Family_open_set ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) ) ))))))
proof
let a being Real,b being Real;
let X being (Subset of ( REAL ));
let V being (Subset of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) ));
assume A1: V = X;
assume A2: X is  open;
(for x being (Element of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) holds (x in V implies (ex r being Real st (r > ( 0 ) & ( Ball (x,r) ) c= V))))
proof
let x being (Element of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) ));
assume A3: x in V;
then reconsider r = x as Real by A1;
consider N being (Neighbourhood of r) such that A4: N c= X by A1,A2,A3,RCOMP_1:18;
consider g being  real number such that A5: ( 0 ) < g and A6: N = ]. ( r - g ),( r + g ) .[ by RCOMP_1:def 6;
reconsider g as Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
A7: ( Ball (x,g) ) c= N
proof
let aa being set;
assume aa in ( Ball (x,g) );
then aa in { q where q is (Element of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )): ( dist (x,q) ) < g } by METRIC_1:17;
then consider q being (Element of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) such that A8: q = aa and A9: ( dist (x,q) ) < g;
A10: (q in (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) & (the carrier of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) c= (the carrier of ( RealSpace ))) by TOPMETR:def 1;
then reconsider a9 = aa as Real by A8,METRIC_1:def 13;
reconsider x1 = x,q1 = q as (Element of ( REAL )) by A1,A3,A10,METRIC_1:def 13;
( dist (x,q) ) = ( (the distance of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) . (x,q) ) by METRIC_1:def 1
.= ( ( real_dist ) . (x,q) ) by METRIC_1:def 13,TOPMETR:def 1;
then ( ( real_dist ) . (q1,x1) ) < g by A9,METRIC_1:9;
then ( abs ( a9 - r ) ) < g by A8,METRIC_1:def 12;
hence thesis by A6,RCOMP_1:1;
end;
N c= ( Ball (x,g) )
proof
let aa being set;
assume A11: aa in N;
then reconsider a9 = aa as Real;
( abs ( a9 - r ) ) < g by A6,A11,RCOMP_1:1;
then A12: ( ( real_dist ) . (a9,r) ) < g by METRIC_1:def 12;
aa in X by A4,A11;
then reconsider a99 = aa,r9 = r as (Element of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) by A1;
( dist (r9,a99) ) = ( (the distance of ( Closed-Interval-MSpace (a,b) )) . (r9,a99) ) by METRIC_1:def 1
.= ( ( real_dist ) . (r9,a99) ) by METRIC_1:def 13,TOPMETR:def 1;
then ( dist (r9,a99) ) < g by A12,METRIC_1:9;
hence thesis by METRIC_1:11;
end;
then N = ( Ball (x,g) ) by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence thesis by A1,A4,A5;
