theorem
Lm4: (for X being (Subset of ( REAL )) holds (X in ( Family_open_set ( RealSpace ) ) implies X is  open))
proof
let X being (Subset of ( REAL ));
assume A1: X in ( Family_open_set ( RealSpace ) );
(for r being  real number holds (r in X implies (ex N being (Neighbourhood of r) st N c= X)))
proof
let r being  real number;
assume A2: r in X;
reconsider r as Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
reconsider x = r as (Element of ( RealSpace )) by METRIC_1:def 13;
(ex N being (Neighbourhood of r) st N c= X)
proof
consider r1 being Real such that A3: r1 > ( 0 ) and A4: ( Ball (x,r1) ) c= X by A1,A2,PCOMPS_1:def 4;
reconsider N1 = ( Ball (x,r1) ) as (Subset of ( REAL )) by METRIC_1:def 13;
(ex g being Real st (( 0 ) < g & ( Ball (x,r1) ) = ]. ( r - g ),( r + g ) .[))
proof
take g = r1;
A5: ]. ( r - g ),( r + g ) .[ c= N1
proof
let a being set;
assume A6: a in ]. ( r - g ),( r + g ) .[;
then reconsider a9 = a as Real;
a9 is (Element of ( REAL ));
then reconsider a99 = a,r9 = r as (Element of ( RealSpace )) by METRIC_1:def 13;
reconsider a1 = a9,r1 = r9 as (Element of ( REAL ));
( abs ( a9 - r ) ) < g by A6,RCOMP_1:1;
then ( ( real_dist ) . (a9,r) ) < g by METRIC_1:def 12;
then (( dist (r9,a99) ) = ( ( real_dist ) . (r,a9) ) & ( ( real_dist ) . (r1,a1) ) < g) by METRIC_1:9,METRIC_1:def 1,METRIC_1:def 13;
hence thesis by METRIC_1:11;
end;
N1 c= ]. ( r - g ),( r + g ) .[
proof
let a being set;
assume a in N1;
then a in { q where q is (Element of ( RealSpace )): ( dist (x,q) ) < g } by METRIC_1:17;
then consider q being (Element of ( RealSpace )) such that A7: q = a and A8: ( dist (x,q) ) < g;
reconsider a9 = a as Real by A7,METRIC_1:def 13;
reconsider x1 = x,q1 = q as (Element of ( REAL )) by METRIC_1:def 13;
( ( real_dist ) . (q1,x1) ) < g by A8,METRIC_1:def 1,METRIC_1:def 13;
then ( abs ( a9 - r ) ) < g by A7,METRIC_1:def 12;
hence thesis by RCOMP_1:1;
end;
hence thesis by A3,A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;
then reconsider N = N1 as (Neighbourhood of r) by RCOMP_1:def 6;
take N;
thus thesis by A4;
end;
hence thesis;
end;
hence thesis by RCOMP_1:20;
end;
