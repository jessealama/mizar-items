theorem
Th2: (for V being  add-associative  right_zeroed  right_complementable non empty RLSStruct holds (for M,N being  Affine (Subset of V) holds (M is_parallel_to N implies N is_parallel_to M)))
proof
let V being  add-associative  right_zeroed  right_complementable non empty RLSStruct;
let M being  Affine (Subset of V),N being  Affine (Subset of V);
assume M is_parallel_to N;
then consider w1 being (VECTOR of V) such that A1: M = ( N + { w1 } ) by CKB1:def 1;
set w2 = ( - w1 );
(for x being set holds (x in N implies x in ( M + { w2 } )))
proof
let x being set;
assume A2: x in N;
then reconsider x as (Element of V);
set y = ( x + w1 );
w1 in { w1 } by TARSKI:def 1;
then y in { ( u + v ) where u is (Element of V),v is (Element of V): (u in N & v in { w1 }) } by A2;
then A3: y in M by A1,RUSUB_4:def 9;
( x + ( w1 + w2 ) ) = ( y + w2 ) by RLVECT_1:def 3;
then ( x + ( 0. V ) ) = ( y + w2 ) by RLVECT_1:5;
then A4: x = ( y + w2 ) by RLVECT_1:4;
w2 in { w2 } by TARSKI:def 1;
then x in { ( u + v ) where u is (Element of V),v is (Element of V): (u in M & v in { w2 }) } by A3,A4;
hence thesis by RUSUB_4:def 9;
end;
then A5: N c= ( M + { w2 } ) by TARSKI:def 3;
take w2;
(for x being set holds (x in ( M + { w2 } ) implies x in N))
proof
let x being set;
assume A6: x in ( M + { w2 } );
then x in { ( u + v ) where u is (Element of V),v is (Element of V): (u in M & v in { w2 }) } by RUSUB_4:def 9;
then consider u9 being (Element of V),v9 being (Element of V) such that A7: x = ( u9 + v9 ) and A8: u9 in M and A9: v9 in { w2 };
reconsider x as (Element of V) by A6;
x = ( u9 + w2 ) by A7,A9,TARSKI:def 1;
then ( x + w1 ) = ( u9 + ( w2 + w1 ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 3;
then A10: ( x + w1 ) = ( u9 + ( 0. V ) ) by RLVECT_1:5;
u9 in { ( u + v ) where u is (Element of V),v is (Element of V): (u in N & v in { w1 }) } by A1,A8,RUSUB_4:def 9;
then consider u1 being (Element of V),v1 being (Element of V) such that A11: (u9 = ( u1 + v1 ) & u1 in N) and A12: v1 in { w1 };
w1 = v1 by A12,TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A10,A11,RLVECT_1:4,RLVECT_1:8;
end;
then ( M + { w2 } ) c= N by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
