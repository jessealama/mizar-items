theorem
Th18: (for V being RealLinearSpace holds (for M being non empty  Affine (Subset of V) holds ( M - M ) = ( union { ( M - { v } ) where v is (VECTOR of V): v in M } )))
proof
let V being RealLinearSpace;
let M being non empty  Affine (Subset of V);
(for x being set holds (x in ( M - M ) implies x in ( union { ( M - { v } ) where v is (VECTOR of V): v in M } )))
proof
let x being set;
assume A1: x in ( M - M );
then reconsider x as (Element of V);
consider u1 being (Element of V),v1 being (Element of V) such that A2: (x = ( u1 - v1 ) & u1 in M) and A3: v1 in M by A1;
v1 in { v1 } by TARSKI:def 1;
then A4: x in { ( p - q ) where p is (Element of V),q is (Element of V): (p in M & q in { v1 }) } by A2;
( M - { v1 } ) in { ( M - { v } ) where v is (VECTOR of V): v in M } by A3;
hence thesis by A4,TARSKI:def 4;
end;
then A5: ( M - M ) c= ( union { ( M - { v } ) where v is (VECTOR of V): v in M } ) by TARSKI:def 3;
(for x being set holds (x in ( union { ( M - { v } ) where v is (VECTOR of V): v in M } ) implies x in ( M - M )))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in ( union { ( M - { v } ) where v is (VECTOR of V): v in M } );
then consider N being set such that A6: x in N and A7: N in { ( M - { v } ) where v is (VECTOR of V): v in M } by TARSKI:def 4;
consider v1 being (VECTOR of V) such that A8: N = ( M - { v1 } ) and A9: v1 in M by A7;
consider p1 being (Element of V),q1 being (Element of V) such that A10: (x = ( p1 - q1 ) & p1 in M) and A11: q1 in { v1 } by A6,A8;
q1 = v1 by A11,TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A9,A10;
end;
then ( union { ( M - { v } ) where v is (VECTOR of V): v in M } ) c= ( M - M ) by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
