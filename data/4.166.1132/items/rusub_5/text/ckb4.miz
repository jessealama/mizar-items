theorem
Th3: (for V being  Abelian  add-associative  right_zeroed  right_complementable non  empty RLSStruct holds (for M,L,N being  Affine (Subset of V) holds ((M is_parallel_to L & L is_parallel_to N) implies M is_parallel_to N)))
proof
let V being  Abelian  add-associative  right_zeroed  right_complementable non  empty RLSStruct;
let M being  Affine (Subset of V);
let L being  Affine (Subset of V);
let N being  Affine (Subset of V);
assume that
A1: M is_parallel_to L
and
A2: L is_parallel_to N;
consider v1 being (Element of V) such that A3: M = ( L + { v1 } ) by A1,CKB1:def 1;
consider u1 being (Element of V) such that A4: L = ( N + { u1 } ) by A2,CKB1:def 1;
set w = ( u1 + v1 );
(for x being set holds (x in ( N + { w } ) implies x in M))
proof
let x being set;

assume A6: x in ( N + { w } );
then reconsider x as (Element of V);
x in { ( u + v ) where u is (Element of V),v is (Element of V): (u in N & v in { w }) } by A6,RUSUB_4:def 9;
then consider u2,v2 being (Element of V) such that A7: x = ( u2 + v2 ) and A8: u2 in N and A9: v2 in { w };
x = ( u2 + ( u1 + v1 ) ) by A7,A9,TARSKI:def 1
.= ( ( u2 + u1 ) + v1 ) by RLVECT_1:def 3;
then ( x - v1 ) = ( ( u2 + u1 ) + ( v1 - v1 ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 3
.= ( ( u2 + u1 ) + ( 0. V ) ) by RLVECT_1:15
.= ( u2 + u1 ) by RLVECT_1:4;

then x in { ( u + v ) where u is (Element of V),v is (Element of V): (u in L & v in { v1 }) } by A10,A11;
