definition
let F;
let VS;
func carr VS -> (Function of ( Subspaces VS ),( bool (the carrier of VS) )) means 
:Def4: (for h being (Element of ( Subspaces VS )) holds (for H being (Subspace of VS) holds (h = H implies ( it . h ) = (the carrier of H))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(for h being (Element of ( Subspaces VS )) holds (h = $1 implies $2 = (the carrier of h)));
A1: (for e holds (e in ( Subspaces VS ) implies (ex u st (u in ( bool (the carrier of VS) ) & P[ e,u ]))))
proof
let e;
assume A2: e in ( Subspaces VS );
then consider E being  strict (Subspace of VS) such that A3: E = e by VECTSP_5:def 3;
reconsider u = E as (Element of ( Subspaces VS )) by A2,A3;
reconsider u1 = ( carr u ) as (Subset of VS);
take u1;
(ex X being (Subspace of VS) st (u = X & u1 = (the carrier of X))) by CKB6:def 1;
hence thesis by A3;
end;
consider f being (Function of ( Subspaces VS ),( bool (the carrier of VS) )) such that A4: (for e holds (e in ( Subspaces VS ) implies P[ e,( f . e ) ])) from FUNCT_2:sch 1(A1);
take f;
thus thesis by A4;
end;
uniqueness
proof
let F1 being (Function of ( Subspaces VS ),( bool (the carrier of VS) ));
let F2 being (Function of ( Subspaces VS ),( bool (the carrier of VS) ));
assume that
A5: (for h1 being (Element of ( Subspaces VS )) holds (for H1 being (Subspace of VS) holds (h1 = H1 implies ( F1 . h1 ) = (the carrier of H1))))
and
A6: (for h2 being (Element of ( Subspaces VS )) holds (for H2 being (Subspace of VS) holds (h2 = H2 implies ( F2 . h2 ) = (the carrier of H2))));
(for h being set holds (h in ( Subspaces VS ) implies ( F1 . h ) = ( F2 . h )))
proof
let h being set;
assume A7: h in ( Subspaces VS );
then h is (Element of ( Subspaces VS ));
then consider H being (Subspace of VS) such that A8: H = h;
( F1 . h ) = (the carrier of H) by A5,A7,A8;
hence thesis by A6,A7,A8;
end;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:12;
