reserve F for Field;
reserve x for set;
definition
let F being Field;
let A being  strict (VectSp of F);
let B being  strict (VectSp of F);
let f being (Function of (the carrier of A),(the carrier of B));
func FuncLatt f -> (Function of (the carrier of ( lattice A )),(the carrier of ( lattice B ))) means 
:Def7: (for S being  strict (Subspace of A) holds (for B0 being (Subset of B) holds (B0 = ( f .: (the carrier of S) ) implies ( it . S ) = ( Lin B0 ))));
existence
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(for S being (Subspace of A) holds (S = $1 implies $2 = ( Lin ( f .: (the carrier of S) ) )));
A1: (for x holds (x in (the carrier of ( lattice A )) implies (ex y being set st (y in (the carrier of ( lattice B )) & P[ x,y ]))))
proof
let x being set;
assume x in (the carrier of ( lattice A ));
then consider X being  strict (Subspace of A) such that A2: X = x by VECTSP_5:def 3;
reconsider y = ( f .: (the carrier of X) ) as (Subset of B);
consider Y being  strict (Subspace of B) such that A3: Y = ( Lin y );
take Y;
thus thesis by A2,A3,VECTSP_5:def 3;
end;
consider f1 being (Function of (the carrier of ( lattice A )),(the carrier of ( lattice B ))) such that A4: (for x holds (x in (the carrier of ( lattice A )) implies P[ x,( f1 . x ) ])) from FUNCT_2:sch 1(A1);
take f1;
thus thesis
proof
let S being  strict (Subspace of A);
let B0 being (Subset of B);
A5: S is (Element of ( Subspaces A )) by VECTSP_5:def 3;
assume B0 = ( f .: (the carrier of S) );
hence thesis by A4,A5;
end;

end;
uniqueness
proof
let F1 being (Function of (the carrier of ( lattice A )),(the carrier of ( lattice B )));
let F2 being (Function of (the carrier of ( lattice A )),(the carrier of ( lattice B )));
assume that
A6: (for S being  strict (Subspace of A) holds (for B0 being (Subset of B) holds (B0 = ( f .: (the carrier of S) ) implies ( F1 . S ) = ( Lin B0 ))))
and
A7: (for S being  strict (Subspace of A) holds (for B0 being (Subset of B) holds (B0 = ( f .: (the carrier of S) ) implies ( F2 . S ) = ( Lin B0 ))));
(for h being set holds (h in (the carrier of ( lattice A )) implies ( F1 . h ) = ( F2 . h )))
proof
let h being set;
assume h in (the carrier of ( lattice A ));
then consider S being  strict (Subspace of A) such that A8: S = h by VECTSP_5:def 3;
reconsider B0 = ( f .: (the carrier of S) ) as (Subset of B);
( F1 . h ) = ( Lin B0 ) by A6,A8;
hence thesis by A7,A8;
end;
hence thesis by FUNCT_2:12;
