reserve F for Field;
reserve VS for  strict (VectSp of F);
theorem
Th6: (for VS being  strict (VectSp of F) holds (for p,q being (Element of ( lattice VS )) holds (for H1,H2 being  strict (Subspace of VS) holds ((p = H1 & q = H2) implies (p [= q iff (the carrier of H1) c= (the carrier of H2))))))
proof
let VS being  strict (VectSp of F);
let p being (Element of ( lattice VS ));
let q being (Element of ( lattice VS ));
let H1 being  strict (Subspace of VS);
let H2 being  strict (Subspace of VS);
consider A1 being  strict (Subspace of VS) such that A1: A1 = p by VECTSP_5:def 3;
consider A2 being  strict (Subspace of VS) such that A2: A2 = q by VECTSP_5:def 3;
A3: ((the carrier of A1) c= (the carrier of A2) implies p [= q)
proof
assume (the carrier of A1) c= (the carrier of A2);
then ( (the carrier of A1) /\ (the carrier of A2) ) = (the carrier of A1) by XBOOLE_1:28;
then A4: ( A1 /\ A2 ) = A1 by VECTSP_5:def 2;
( A1 /\ A2 ) = ( (the L_meet of ( lattice VS )) . (p,q) ) by A1,A2,VECTSP_5:def 8
.= ( p "/\" q ) by LATTICES:def 2;
hence thesis by A1,A4,LATTICES:4;
end;
(p [= q implies (the carrier of A1) c= (the carrier of A2))
proof
assume p [= q;
then A5: ( p "/\" q ) = p by LATTICES:4;
( p "/\" q ) = ( ( SubMeet VS ) . (p,q) ) by LATTICES:def 2
.= ( A1 /\ A2 ) by A1,A2,VECTSP_5:def 8;
then ( (the carrier of A1) /\ (the carrier of A2) ) = (the carrier of A1) by A1,A5,VECTSP_5:def 2;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_1:17;

hence thesis by A1,A2,A3;
