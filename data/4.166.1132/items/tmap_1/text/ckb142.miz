theorem
Th135: (X1,X2 are_separated  iff (X1 misses X2 & (for Y being non empty TopSpace holds (for g being (Function of ( X1 union X2 ),Y) holds ((( g | X1 ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of X1,Y) & ( g | X2 ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of X2,Y)) implies g is  continuous  continuous (Function of ( X1 union X2 ),Y))))))
proof
thus (X1,X2 are_separated  implies (X1 misses X2 & (for Y being non empty TopSpace holds (for g being (Function of ( X1 union X2 ),Y) holds ((( g | X1 ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of X1,Y) & ( g | X2 ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of X2,Y)) implies g is  continuous  continuous (Function of ( X1 union X2 ),Y))))))
proof
assume A1: X1,X2 are_separated ;
hence X1 misses X2 by TSEP_1:63;
X1,X2 are_weakly_separated  by A1,TSEP_1:78;
hence thesis by CKB133:1;
