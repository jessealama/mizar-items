theorem
Th13: (for X1,X2 being TopSpace holds (X2 = ( the TopStruct of X1 ) implies (X1 is  closed  closed (SubSpace of X) iff X2 is  closed  closed (SubSpace of X))))
proof
let X1 being TopSpace,X2 being TopSpace;
assume A1: X2 = ( the TopStruct of X1 );
thus (X1 is  closed  closed (SubSpace of X) implies X2 is  closed  closed (SubSpace of X))
proof
assume A2: X1 is  closed  closed (SubSpace of X);
then reconsider Y2 = X2 as (SubSpace of X) by A1,CKB9:1;
reconsider A2 = (the carrier of Y2) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
A2 is  closed by A1,A2,TSEP_1:11;
hence thesis by TSEP_1:11;
end;

assume A3: X2 is  closed  closed (SubSpace of X);
then reconsider Y1 = X1 as (SubSpace of X) by A1,CKB9:1;
reconsider A1 = (the carrier of Y1) as (Subset of X) by TSEP_1:1;
A1 is  closed by A1,A3,TSEP_1:11;
hence thesis by TSEP_1:11;
end;
