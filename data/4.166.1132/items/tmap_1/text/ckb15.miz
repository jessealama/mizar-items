reserve X2 for non empty (SubSpace of X);
theorem
(for x being (Point of ( X1 union X2 )) holds (for F1 being (Subset of X1) holds (for F2 being (Subset of X2) holds ((((F1 is  closed & x in F1) & F2 is  closed) & x in F2) implies (ex H being (Subset of ( X1 union X2 )) st ((H is  closed & x in H) & H c= ( F1 \/ F2 )))))))
proof
let x being (Point of ( X1 union X2 ));
let F1 being (Subset of X1);
let F2 being (Subset of X2);
assume that
A1: F1 is  closed
and
A2: x in F1
and
A3: F2 is  closed
and
A4: x in F2;
A5: X1 is (SubSpace of ( X1 union X2 )) by TSEP_1:22;
then reconsider C1 = (the carrier of X1) as (Subset of ( X1 union X2 )) by TSEP_1:1;
consider H1 being (Subset of ( X1 union X2 )) such that A6: H1 is  closed and A7: ( H1 /\ ( [#] X1 ) ) = F1 by A1,A5,PRE_TOPC:13;
A8: x in H1 by A2,A7,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A9: X2 is (SubSpace of ( X1 union X2 )) by TSEP_1:22;
then reconsider C2 = (the carrier of X2) as (Subset of ( X1 union X2 )) by TSEP_1:1;
consider H2 being (Subset of ( X1 union X2 )) such that A10: H2 is  closed and A11: ( H2 /\ ( [#] X2 ) ) = F2 by A3,A9,PRE_TOPC:13;
A12: x in H2 by A4,A11,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
take H = ( H1 /\ H2 );
A13: (( H /\ C1 ) c= ( H1 /\ C1 ) & ( H /\ C2 ) c= ( H2 /\ C2 )) by XBOOLE_1:17,XBOOLE_1:26;
(the carrier of ( X1 union X2 )) = ( C1 \/ C2 ) by TSEP_1:def 2;
then H = ( H /\ ( C1 \/ C2 ) ) by XBOOLE_1:28
.= ( ( H /\ C1 ) \/ ( H /\ C2 ) ) by XBOOLE_1:23;
hence thesis by A6,A7,A10,A11,A13,A8,A12,XBOOLE_0:def 4,XBOOLE_1:13;
