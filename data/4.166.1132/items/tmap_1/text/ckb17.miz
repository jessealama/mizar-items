theorem
Th20: (for x being (Point of ( X1 union X2 )) holds (for x1 being (Point of X1) holds (for x2 being (Point of X2) holds ((x1 = x & x2 = x) implies (for A1 being (a_neighborhood of x1) holds (for A2 being (a_neighborhood of x2) holds (ex V being (Subset of ( X1 union X2 )) st ((V is  open & x in V) & V c= ( A1 \/ A2 )))))))))
proof
let x being (Point of ( X1 union X2 ));
let x1 being (Point of X1);
let x2 being (Point of X2);
assume that
A1: (x1 = x & x2 = x);
let A1 being (a_neighborhood of x1);
let A2 being (a_neighborhood of x2);
consider U1 being (Subset of X1) such that A2: U1 is  open and A3: U1 c= A1 and A4: x1 in U1 by CONNSP_2:6;
consider U2 being (Subset of X2) such that A5: U2 is  open and A6: U2 c= A2 and A7: x2 in U2 by CONNSP_2:6;
consider V being (Subset of ( X1 union X2 )) such that A8: ((V is  open & x in V) & V c= ( U1 \/ U2 )) by A1,A2,A4,A5,A7,CKB16:1;
take V;
( U1 \/ U2 ) c= ( A1 \/ A2 ) by A3,A6,XBOOLE_1:13;
hence thesis by A8,XBOOLE_1:1;
