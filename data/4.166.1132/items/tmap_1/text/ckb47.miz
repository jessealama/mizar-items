theorem
Th48: (for x being (Point of X) holds (f is_continuous_at x iff (for G being (Subset of Y) holds ((G is  open & ( f . x ) in G) implies (ex H being (Subset of X) st ((H is  open & x in H) & ( f .: H ) c= G))))))
proof
let x being (Point of X);
thus (f is_continuous_at x implies (for G being (Subset of Y) holds ((G is  open & ( f . x ) in G) implies (ex H being (Subset of X) st ((H is  open & x in H) & ( f .: H ) c= G)))))
proof
assume A1: f is_continuous_at x;
let G being (Subset of Y);
assume (G is  open & ( f . x ) in G);
then reconsider G0 = G as (a_neighborhood of ( f . x )) by CONNSP_2:3;
consider H0 being (a_neighborhood of x) such that A2: ( f .: H0 ) c= G0 by A1,CKB44:def 1;
consider H being (Subset of X) such that A3: H is  open and A4: H c= H0 and A5: x in H by CONNSP_2:6;
take H;
( f .: H ) c= ( f .: H0 ) by A4,RELAT_1:123;
hence thesis by A2,A3,A5,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;

assume A6: (for G being (Subset of Y) holds ((G is  open & ( f . x ) in G) implies (ex H being (Subset of X) st ((H is  open & x in H) & ( f .: H ) c= G))));
let G0 being (a_neighborhood of ( f . x ));
consider G being (Subset of Y) such that A7: G is  open and A8: G c= G0 and A9: ( f . x ) in G by CONNSP_2:6;
consider H being (Subset of X) such that A10: (H is  open & x in H) and A11: ( f .: H ) c= G by A6,A7,A9;
reconsider H0 = H as (a_neighborhood of x) by A10,CONNSP_2:3;
take H0;
thus thesis by A8,A11,XBOOLE_1:1;
