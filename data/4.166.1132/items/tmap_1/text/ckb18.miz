theorem
Th21: (for x being (Point of ( X1 union X2 )) holds (for x1 being (Point of X1) holds (for x2 being (Point of X2) holds ((x1 = x & x2 = x) implies (for A1 being (a_neighborhood of x1) holds (for A2 being (a_neighborhood of x2) holds (ex A being (a_neighborhood of x) st A c= ( A1 \/ A2 ))))))))
proof
let x being (Point of ( X1 union X2 ));
let x1 being (Point of X1);
let x2 being (Point of X2);
assume that
A1: (x1 = x & x2 = x);
let A1 being (a_neighborhood of x1);
let A2 being (a_neighborhood of x2);
consider V being (Subset of ( X1 union X2 )) such that A2: (V is  open & x in V) and A3: V c= ( A1 \/ A2 ) by A1,CKB17:1;
reconsider W = V as (a_neighborhood of x) by A2,CONNSP_2:3;
take W;
thus thesis by A3;
