theorem
Th126: (X1,X2 are_weakly_separated  implies (for g being (Function of ( X1 union X2 ),Y) holds (g is  continuous  continuous (Function of ( X1 union X2 ),Y) iff (( g | X1 ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of X1,Y) & ( g | X2 ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of X2,Y)))))
proof
assume A1: X1,X2 are_weakly_separated ;
let g being (Function of ( X1 union X2 ),Y);
A2: X2 is (SubSpace of ( X1 union X2 )) by TSEP_1:22;
A3: X1 is (SubSpace of ( X1 union X2 )) by TSEP_1:22;
hence (g is  continuous  continuous (Function of ( X1 union X2 ),Y) implies (( g | X1 ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of X1,Y) & ( g | X2 ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of X2,Y))) by A2,CKB91:1;
thus ((( g | X1 ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of X1,Y) & ( g | X2 ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of X2,Y)) implies g is  continuous  continuous (Function of ( X1 union X2 ),Y))
proof

and
A5: ( g | X2 ) is  continuous  continuous (Function of X2,Y);
(for x being (Point of ( X1 union X2 )) holds g is_continuous_at x)
