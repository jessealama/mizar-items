theorem
(for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (T is  first-countable implies (T is  T_2 iff (for S being (sequence of T) holds (for x1,x2 being (Point of T) holds ((x1 in ( Lim S ) & x2 in ( Lim S )) implies x1 = x2))))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
assume A1: T is  first-countable;
thus (T is  T_2 implies (for S being (sequence of T) holds (for x1,x2 being (Point of T) holds ((x1 in ( Lim S ) & x2 in ( Lim S )) implies x1 = x2)))) by CKB11:1;
assume A2: (for S being (sequence of T) holds (for x1,x2 being (Point of T) holds ((x1 in ( Lim S ) & x2 in ( Lim S )) implies x1 = x2)));
assume (not T is  T_2);
then consider x1,x2 being (Point of T) such that A3: x1 <> x2 and A4: (for U1,U2 being (Subset of T) holds ((((U1 is  open & U2 is  open) & x1 in U1) & x2 in U2) implies U1 meets U2)) by PRE_TOPC:def 10;
consider B1 being (Basis of x1) such that A5: (ex S being Function st ((( dom S ) = ( NAT ) & ( rng S ) = B1) & (for n,m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m >= n implies ( S . m ) c= ( S . n ))))) by A1,CKB9:1;
consider B2 being (Basis of x2) such that A6: (ex S being Function st ((( dom S ) = ( NAT ) & ( rng S ) = B2) & (for n,m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m >= n implies ( S . m ) c= ( S . n ))))) by A1,CKB9:1;
consider S1 being Function such that A7: ( dom S1 ) = ( NAT ) and A8: ( rng S1 ) = B1 and A9: (for n,m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m >= n implies ( S1 . m ) c= ( S1 . n ))) by A5;
consider S2 being Function such that A10: ( dom S2 ) = ( NAT ) and A11: ( rng S2 ) = B2 and A12: (for n,m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m >= n implies ( S2 . m ) c= ( S2 . n ))) by A6;
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
$2 in ( ( S1 . $1 ) /\ ( S2 . $1 ) );
A13: (for n being set holds (n in ( NAT ) implies (ex x being set st (x in (the carrier of T) & P[ n,x ]))))
proof
let n being set;
set x = the (Element of ( ( S1 . n ) /\ ( S2 . n ) ));
assume A14: n in ( NAT );
then A15: ( S1 . n ) in B1 by A7,A8,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then reconsider U1 = ( S1 . n ) as (Subset of T);
A16: ( S2 . n ) in B2 by A10,A11,A14,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then reconsider U2 = ( S2 . n ) as (Subset of T);
take x;
reconsider U1 as (Subset of T);
reconsider U2 as (Subset of T);
A17: (U2 is  open & x2 in U2) by A16,YELLOW_8:12;
(U1 is  open & x1 in U1) by A15,YELLOW_8:12;
then U1 meets U2 by A4,A17;
then A18: ( U1 /\ U2 ) <> ( {} ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then x in ( U1 /\ U2 );
hence x in (the carrier of T);
thus thesis by A18;
end;
consider S being Function such that A19: (( dom S ) = ( NAT ) & ( rng S ) c= (the carrier of T)) and A20: (for n being set holds (n in ( NAT ) implies P[ n,( S . n ) ])) from FUNCT_1:sch 5(A13);
reconsider S as (Function of ( NAT ),(the carrier of T)) by A19,FUNCT_2:def 1,RELSET_1:4;
S is_convergent_to x2
proof
let U2 being (Subset of T);
assume (U2 is  open & x2 in U2);
then consider V2 being (Subset of T) such that A21: V2 in B2 and A22: V2 c= U2 by YELLOW_8:13;
consider n being set such that A23: n in ( dom S2 ) and A24: V2 = ( S2 . n ) by A11,A21,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider n as (Element of ( NAT )) by A10,A23;
take n;
let m being (Element of ( NAT ));
(( S . m ) in ( ( S1 . m ) /\ ( S2 . m ) ) & ( ( S1 . m ) /\ ( S2 . m ) ) c= ( S2 . m )) by A20,XBOOLE_1:17;
then A25: ( S . m ) in ( S2 . m );
assume n <= m;
then ( S2 . m ) c= ( S2 . n ) by A12;
then ( S . m ) in ( S2 . n ) by A25;
hence ( S . m ) in U2 by A22,A24;
end;
then A26: x2 in ( Lim S ) by FRECHET:def 5;
S is_convergent_to x1
proof
let U1 being (Subset of T);
assume (U1 is  open & x1 in U1);
then consider V1 being (Subset of T) such that A27: V1 in B1 and A28: V1 c= U1 by YELLOW_8:13;
consider n being set such that A29: n in ( dom S1 ) and A30: V1 = ( S1 . n ) by A8,A27,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider n as (Element of ( NAT )) by A7,A29;
take n;
let m being (Element of ( NAT ));
(( S . m ) in ( ( S1 . m ) /\ ( S2 . m ) ) & ( ( S1 . m ) /\ ( S2 . m ) ) c= ( S1 . m )) by A20,XBOOLE_1:17;
then A31: ( S . m ) in ( S1 . m );
assume n <= m;
then ( S1 . m ) c= ( S1 . n ) by A9;
then ( S . m ) in ( S1 . n ) by A31;
hence ( S . m ) in U1 by A28,A30;
end;
then x1 in ( Lim S ) by FRECHET:def 5;
hence contradiction by A2,A3,A26;
end;
