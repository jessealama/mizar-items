theorem
(for T being non  empty TopStruct holds (T is  Frechet implies (for S being (sequence of T) holds (for x being (Point of T) holds (x is_a_cluster_point_of S implies (ex S1 being (subsequence of S) st S1 is_convergent_to x))))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopStruct;
assume A1: T is  Frechet;
let S being (sequence of T);
let x being (Point of T);
assume A2: x is_a_cluster_point_of S;
defpred P[ (Point of T) ]
 means
x in ( Cl { $1 } );
reconsider Y = { y where y is (Point of T): P[ y ] } as (Subset of T) from DOMAIN_1:sch 7;
per cases ;
suppose A3: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (ex m being (Element of ( NAT )) st (m >= n & ( S . m ) in Y)));

defpred P[ set ]
 means
$1 in Y;
A4: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (ex m being (Element of ( NAT )) st (n <= m & P[ ( S . m ) ]))) by A3;
consider S1 being (subsequence of S) such that A5: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ ( S1 . n ) ]) from VALUED_1:sch 1(A4);
take S1;
( rng S1 ) c= Y
proof
let y being set;
assume y in ( rng S1 );
then consider n being set such that A6: n in ( dom S1 ) and A7: y = ( S1 . n ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider n as (Element of ( NAT )) by A6;
( S1 . n ) in Y by A5;
hence thesis by A7;
end;
hence thesis by CKB41:1;
end;
suppose (ex n being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m >= n implies (not ( S . m ) in Y))));

then consider n0 being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A8: (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (m >= n0 implies (not ( S . m ) in Y)));
set S9 = ( S ^\ n0 );
x in ( Cl ( rng S9 ) ) by A2,CKB49:1,CKB50:1;
then consider S2 being (sequence of T) such that A9: ( rng S2 ) c= ( rng S9 ) and A10: x in ( Lim S2 ) by A1,FRECHET:def 6;
A11: S2 is_convergent_to x by A10,FRECHET:def 5;
A12: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (not ( S9 . n ) in Y))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
(not ( S . ( n + n0 ) ) in Y) by A8,NAT_1:11;
hence thesis by NAT_1:def 3;
end;
( ( rng S9 ) /\ Y ) = ( {} )
proof
set y = the (Element of ( ( rng S9 ) /\ Y ));
assume A13: ( ( rng S9 ) /\ Y ) <> ( {} );
then y in ( rng S9 ) by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then consider n being set such that A14: n in ( dom S9 ) and A15: y = ( S9 . n ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider n as (Element of ( NAT )) by A14;
(not ( S9 . n ) in Y) by A12;
hence contradiction by A13,A15,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
then ( rng S9 ) misses Y by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
then consider S29 being (subsequence of S2) such that A16: S29 is  one-to-one by A9,A11,CKB43:1,XBOOLE_1:63;
( rng S29 ) c= ( rng S2 ) by VALUED_0:21;
then consider P being (Permutation of ( NAT )) such that A17: ( S29 * P ) is (subsequence of S9) by A9,A16,CKB44:1,XBOOLE_1:1;
reconsider S1 = ( S29 * P ) as (subsequence of S9) by A17;
reconsider S1 as (subsequence of S) by VALUED_0:20;
take S1;
S29 is_convergent_to x by A11,CKB21:1;
hence thesis by CKB47:1;
end;
