Th38: (for T being non  empty TopStruct holds (for x being (Point of T) holds (for Y being (Subset of T) holds (for S being (sequence of T) holds (((Y = { y where y is (Point of T): x in ( Cl { y } ) } & ( rng S ) misses Y) & S is_convergent_to x) implies (ex S1 being (subsequence of S) st S1 is  one-to-one))))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopStruct;
let x being (Point of T);
let Y being (Subset of T);
let S being (sequence of T);
assume that
A1: Y = { y where y is (Point of T): x in ( Cl { y } ) }
and
A2: ( ( rng S ) /\ Y ) = ( {} )
and
A3: S is_convergent_to x;
defpred P[ (Element of ( NAT )),set,set ]
 means
($3 in ( NAT ) & (for n1,n2,m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (((n1 = $2 & n2 = $3) & n2 <= m) implies ( S . m ) <> ( S . n1 ))));
A4: (for z being set holds (z in ( rng S ) implies (ex n0 being (Element of ( NAT )) st (for m being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (n0 <= m implies z <> ( S . m ))))))
proof
let z being set;
defpred P[ set ]
 means
$1 = z;
assume A5: z in ( rng S );
then reconsider z9 = z as (Point of T);
assume (for n0 being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (ex m being (Element of ( NAT )) st (n0 <= m & z = ( S . m ))));
then A6: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (ex m being (Element of ( NAT )) st (n <= m & P[ ( S . m ) ])));
(ex S1 being (subsequence of S) st (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds P[ ( S1 . n ) ])) from VALUED_1:sch 1(A6);
then x in ( Cl { z9 } ) by A3,CKB21:1,CKB42:1;
then z9 in Y by A1;
hence contradiction by A2,A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
A7: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (for z1 being set holds (ex z2 being set st P[ n,z1,z2 ])))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
let z1 being set;
per cases ;
suppose A8: (not z1 in ( NAT ));

take ( 0 );
thus ( 0 ) in ( NAT );
let n1 being (Element of ( NAT ));
let n2 being (Element of ( NAT ));
let m being (Element of ( NAT ));
assume that
A9: n1 = z1
and
n2 = ( 0 )
and
n2 <= m;
thus thesis by A8,A9;
end;
suppose z1 in ( NAT );

then z1 in ( dom S ) by NORMSP_1:12;
then ( S . z1 ) in ( rng S ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;

A14: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( f . n ) is (Element of ( NAT )))
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
per cases ;
suppose n = ( 0 );

hence thesis by A12;

then reconsider n1 = ( n - 1 ) as (Element of ( NAT )) by INT_1:5;
( n1 + 1 ) = n;
hence thesis by A13;
end;
end;
then (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( f . n ) is  real);
then reconsider f as Real_Sequence by A11,SEQ_1:2;
f is  increasing
proof
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));

reconsider n1 = ( f . n ) as (Element of ( NAT )) by A14;
assume ( f . n ) >= ( f . ( n + 1 ) );

then A17: ( n1 + 1 ) <= n2 by NAT_1:13;
( f . ( n1 + 1 ) ) <= ( f . n2 )
proof
per cases ;
suppose ( n1 + 1 ) = n2;

hence thesis;
end;
suppose ( n1 + 1 ) <> n2;

then ( n1 + 1 ) < n2 by A17,XXREAL_0:1;
hence thesis by SEQM_3:1;
end;
end;
then A18: ( S . ( f . n2 ) ) <> ( S . n19 ) by A13;
