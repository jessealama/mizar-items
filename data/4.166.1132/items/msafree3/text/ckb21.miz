theorem
Th12: (for S being ManySortedSign holds (for s being set holds (s in (the carrier of S) implies (for p being  DTree-yielding FinSequence holds (x in ( ( S variables_in ( [ z,(the carrier of S) ] -tree p ) ) . s ) iff (ex t being DecoratedTree st (t in ( rng p ) & x in ( ( S variables_in t ) . s ))))))))
proof
let S being ManySortedSign;
let s being set;
assume that
A1: s in (the carrier of S);
let p being  DTree-yielding FinSequence;
reconsider q = ( [ z,(the carrier of S) ] -tree p ) as DecoratedTree;
A2: ( ( S variables_in q ) . s ) = { ( a `1 ) where a is (Element of ( rng q )): ( a `2 ) = s } by A1,CKB17:def 1;
A3: ( dom q ) = ( tree ( doms p ) ) by TREES_4:10;
A4: ( dom ( doms p ) ) = ( dom p ) by TREES_3:37;
then A5: ( len p ) = ( len ( doms p ) ) by FINSEQ_3:29;
hereby
assume x in ( ( S variables_in ( [ z,(the carrier of S) ] -tree p ) ) . s );
then consider a being (Element of ( rng q )) such that A6: x = ( a `1 ) and A7: ( a `2 ) = s by A2;
consider y such that A8: y in ( dom q ) and A9: a = ( q . y ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider y as (Element of ( dom q )) by A8;
(( q . ( {} ) ) = [ z,(the carrier of S) ] & s <> (the carrier of S)) by A1,TREES_4:def 4;
then y <> ( {} ) by A7,A9,MCART_1:7;
then consider n being (Element of ( NAT )),r being FinSequence such that A10: n < ( len ( doms p ) ) and A11: r in ( ( doms p ) . ( n + 1 ) ) and A12: y = ( <* n *> ^ r ) by A3,TREES_3:def 15;
(1 <= ( n + 1 ) & ( n + 1 ) <= ( len ( doms p ) )) by A10,NAT_1:11,NAT_1:13;
then A13: ( n + 1 ) in ( dom ( doms p ) ) by FINSEQ_3:25;
then reconsider t = ( p . ( n + 1 ) ) as DecoratedTree by A4,TREES_3:24;
reconsider r as (FinSequence of ( NAT )) by A12,FINSEQ_1:36;
take t;
thus t in ( rng p ) by A4,A13,FUNCT_1:def 3;
A14: ( ( doms p ) . ( n + 1 ) ) = ( dom t ) by A4,A13,FUNCT_6:22;
A15: t = ( q | <* n *> ) by A5,A10,TREES_4:def 4;
then ( dom t ) = ( ( dom q ) | <* n *> ) by TREES_2:def 10;
then a = ( t . r ) by A9,A11,A12,A15,A14,TREES_2:def 10;
then a in ( rng t ) by A11,A14,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then x in { ( b `1 ) where b is (Element of ( rng t )): ( b `2 ) = s } by A6,A7;
hence x in ( ( S variables_in t ) . s ) by A1,CKB17:def 1;
end;
given t being DecoratedTree such that
A16: t in ( rng p )
and
A17: x in ( ( S variables_in t ) . s );

consider y such that A18: y in ( dom p ) and A19: t = ( p . y ) by A16,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider y as (Element of ( NAT )) by A18;
y >= 1 by A18,FINSEQ_3:25;
then consider n being Nat such that A20: y = ( 1 + n ) by NAT_1:10;
reconsider n as (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
y <= ( len p ) by A18,FINSEQ_3:25;
then A21: n < ( len p ) by A20,NAT_1:13;
then A22: t = ( q | <* n *> ) by A19,A20,TREES_4:def 4;
A23: (( {} ) in ( dom t ) & ( <* n *> ^ ( {} ) ) = <* n *>) by FINSEQ_1:34,TREES_1:22;
( dom t ) = ( ( doms p ) . ( n + 1 ) ) by A18,A19,A20,FUNCT_6:22;
then <* n *> in ( dom q ) by A3,A5,A21,A23,TREES_3:def 15;
then A24: ( rng t ) c= ( rng q ) by A22,TREES_2:32;
x in { ( b `1 ) where b is (Element of ( rng t )): ( b `2 ) = s } by A1,A17,CKB17:def 1;
then consider b being (Element of ( rng t )) such that A25: (x = ( b `1 ) & ( b `2 ) = s);
b in ( rng t );
hence thesis by A2,A25,A24;
