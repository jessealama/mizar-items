theorem
(for S,T being Semilattice holds ([: S,T :] is  meet-continuous implies (S is  meet-continuous & T is  meet-continuous)))
proof
let S being Semilattice,T being Semilattice;
assume that
A1: [: S,T :] is  up-complete
and
A2: (for x being (Element of [: S,T :]) holds (for D being non empty  directed (Subset of [: S,T :]) holds ( x "/\" ( sup D ) ) = ( sup ( { x } "/\" D ) )));
hereby
thus S is  up-complete by A1,WAYBEL_2:11;
