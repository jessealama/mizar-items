theorem
Th18: (for S,T being  antisymmetric  up-complete non  empty  reflexive RelStr holds (for a,c being (Element of S) holds (for b,d being (Element of T) holds ([ a,b ] << [ c,d ] implies (a << c & b << d)))))
proof
let S being  antisymmetric  up-complete non  empty  reflexive RelStr;
let T being  antisymmetric  up-complete non  empty  reflexive RelStr;
let a being (Element of S);
let c being (Element of S);
let b being (Element of T);
let d being (Element of T);
assume A1: (for D being non  empty  directed (Subset of [: S,T :]) holds ([ c,d ] <= ( sup D ) implies (ex e being (Element of [: S,T :]) st (e in D & [ a,b ] <= e))));
A2: (the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
thus a << c
proof
reconsider d9 = { d } as non  empty  directed (Subset of T) by WAYBEL_0:5;
let D being non  empty  directed (Subset of S);
assume that
A3: c <= ( sup D );
A4: d <= ( sup d9 ) by YELLOW_0:39;
( ex_sup_of D,S &  ex_sup_of d9,T) by WAYBEL_0:75;
then ( sup [: D,d9 :] ) = [ ( sup D ),( sup d9 ) ] by YELLOW_3:43;
then [ c,d ] <= ( sup [: D,d9 :] ) by A3,A4,YELLOW_3:11;
then consider e being (Element of [: S,T :]) such that A5: e in [: D,d9 :] and A6: [ a,b ] <= e by A1;
take ( e `1 );
thus ( e `1 ) in D by A5,MCART_1:10;
e = [ ( e `1 ),( e `2 ) ] by A2,MCART_1:21;
hence thesis by A6,YELLOW_3:11;
end;

A8: c <= ( sup c9 ) by YELLOW_0:39;

then ( sup [: c9,D :] ) = [ ( sup c9 ),( sup D ) ] by YELLOW_3:43;
then [ c,d ] <= ( sup [: c9,D :] ) by A7,A8,YELLOW_3:11;
then consider e being (Element of [: S,T :]) such that A9: e in [: c9,D :] and A10: [ a,b ] <= e by A1;
take ( e `2 );
thus ( e `2 ) in D by A9,MCART_1:10;
e = [ ( e `1 ),( e `2 ) ] by A2,MCART_1:21;
hence thesis by A10,YELLOW_3:11;
