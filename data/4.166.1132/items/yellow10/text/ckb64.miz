theorem
(for S,T being  antisymmetric  up-complete non empty  reflexive RelStr holds (for X being (Subset of [: S,T :]) holds (X is  property(S) implies (( proj1 X ) is  property(S) & ( proj2 X ) is  property(S)))))
proof
let S being  antisymmetric  up-complete non empty  reflexive RelStr,T being  antisymmetric  up-complete non empty  reflexive RelStr;
let X being (Subset of [: S,T :]);
assume that
A1: (for D being non empty  directed (Subset of [: S,T :]) holds (( sup D ) in X implies (ex y being (Element of [: S,T :]) st (y in D & (for x being (Element of [: S,T :]) holds ((x in D & x >= y) implies x in X))))));
A2: (the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
hereby
let D being non empty  directed (Subset of S);
assume ( sup D ) in ( proj1 X );
then consider t being set such that A3: [ ( sup D ),t ] in X by RELAT_1:def 4;
reconsider t as (Element of T) by A2,A3,ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider t9 = { t } as non empty  directed (Subset of T) by WAYBEL_0:5;
 ex_sup_of [: D,t9 :],[: S,T :] by WAYBEL_0:75;
then ( sup [: D,t9 :] ) = [ ( sup ( proj1 [: D,t9 :] ) ),( sup ( proj2 [: D,t9 :] ) ) ] by YELLOW_3:46
.= [ ( sup D ),( sup ( proj2 [: D,t9 :] ) ) ] by FUNCT_5:9
.= [ ( sup D ),( sup t9 ) ] by FUNCT_5:9
.= [ ( sup D ),t ] by YELLOW_0:39;
then consider y being (Element of [: S,T :]) such that A4: y in [: D,t9 :] and A5: (for x being (Element of [: S,T :]) holds ((x in [: D,t9 :] & x >= y) implies x in X)) by A1,A3;
take z = ( y `1 );
A6: y = [ ( y `1 ),( y `2 ) ] by A2,MCART_1:21;
hence z in D by A4,ZFMISC_1:87;
A7: ( y `2 ) = t by A4,A6,ZFMISC_1:106;
let x being (Element of S);
assume x in D;
then A8: [ x,t ] in [: D,t9 :] by ZFMISC_1:106;
A9: ( y `2 ) <= ( y `2 );
assume x >= z;
then [ x,t ] >= y by A6,A7,A9,YELLOW_3:11;
then [ x,t ] in X by A5,A8;
hence x in ( proj1 X ) by FUNCT_5:2;
end;
let D being non empty  directed (Subset of T);
assume ( sup D ) in ( proj2 X );
then consider s being set such that A10: [ s,( sup D ) ] in X by RELAT_1:def 5;
reconsider s as (Element of S) by A2,A10,ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider s9 = { s } as non empty  directed (Subset of S) by WAYBEL_0:5;
 ex_sup_of [: s9,D :],[: S,T :] by WAYBEL_0:75;
then ( sup [: s9,D :] ) = [ ( sup ( proj1 [: s9,D :] ) ),( sup ( proj2 [: s9,D :] ) ) ] by YELLOW_3:46
.= [ ( sup s9 ),( sup ( proj2 [: s9,D :] ) ) ] by FUNCT_5:9
.= [ ( sup s9 ),( sup D ) ] by FUNCT_5:9
.= [ s,( sup D ) ] by YELLOW_0:39;
then consider y being (Element of [: S,T :]) such that A11: y in [: s9,D :] and A12: (for x being (Element of [: S,T :]) holds ((x in [: s9,D :] & x >= y) implies x in X)) by A1,A10;
take z = ( y `2 );
A13: y = [ ( y `1 ),( y `2 ) ] by A2,MCART_1:21;
hence z in D by A11,ZFMISC_1:87;
A14: ( y `1 ) = s by A11,A13,ZFMISC_1:105;
let x being (Element of T);
assume x in D;
then A15: [ s,x ] in [: s9,D :] by ZFMISC_1:105;
A16: ( y `1 ) <= ( y `1 );
assume x >= z;
then [ s,x ] >= y by A13,A14,A16,YELLOW_3:11;
then [ s,x ] in X by A12,A15;
hence thesis by FUNCT_5:2;
