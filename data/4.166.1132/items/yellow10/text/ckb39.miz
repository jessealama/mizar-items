theorem
(for S,T being non  empty RelStr holds (for s being (Element of S) holds (for t being (Element of T) holds [: ( downarrow s ),( downarrow t ) :] = ( downarrow [ s,t ] ))))
proof
let S being non  empty RelStr;
let T being non  empty RelStr;
let s being (Element of S);
let t being (Element of T);
hereby
let x being set;
assume x in [: ( downarrow s ),( downarrow t ) :];
then consider x1,x2 being set such that A1: x1 in ( downarrow s ) and A2: x2 in ( downarrow t ) and A3: x = [ x1,x2 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider x2 as (Element of T) by A2;
reconsider x1 as (Element of S) by A1;
(s >= x1 & t >= x2) by A1,A2,WAYBEL_0:17;
then [ s,t ] >= [ x1,x2 ] by YELLOW_3:11;
hence x in ( downarrow [ s,t ] ) by A3,WAYBEL_0:17;
end;
let x being set;
assume A4: x in ( downarrow [ s,t ] );
then reconsider x9 = x as (Element of [: S,T :]);
(the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then A5: x9 = [ ( x9 `1 ),( x9 `2 ) ] by MCART_1:21;
A6: [ s,t ] >= x9 by A4,WAYBEL_0:17;
then t >= ( x9 `2 ) by A5,YELLOW_3:11;
then A7: ( x `2 ) in ( downarrow t ) by WAYBEL_0:17;
s >= ( x9 `1 ) by A5,A6,YELLOW_3:11;
then ( x `1 ) in ( downarrow s ) by WAYBEL_0:17;
hence thesis by A5,A7,MCART_1:11;
end;
