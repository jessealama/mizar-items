theorem
Th15: (for S,T being  with_infima  antisymmetric RelStr holds (for x1,y1 being (Element of S) holds (for x2,y2 being (Element of T) holds [ ( x1 "/\" y1 ),( x2 "/\" y2 ) ] = ( [ x1,x2 ] "/\" [ y1,y2 ] ))))
proof
let S being  with_infima  antisymmetric RelStr;
let T being  with_infima  antisymmetric RelStr;
let x1 being (Element of S);
let y1 being (Element of S);
let x2 being (Element of T);
let y2 being (Element of T);
