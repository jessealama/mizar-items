theorem
(for S being RelStr holds (for T being  reflexive RelStr holds (for X being (Subset of [: S,T :]) holds ( proj1 ( uparrow X ) ) = ( uparrow ( proj1 X ) ))))
proof
let S being RelStr;
let T being  reflexive RelStr;
let X being (Subset of [: S,T :]);
thus ( proj1 ( uparrow X ) ) c= ( uparrow ( proj1 X ) ) by CKB36:1;
let a being set;
assume A1: a in ( uparrow ( proj1 X ) );
then reconsider S9 = S as non  empty RelStr;
reconsider a9 = a as (Element of S9) by A1;
consider b being (Element of S9) such that A2: b <= a9 and A3: b in ( proj1 X ) by A1,WAYBEL_0:def 16;
consider b2 being set such that A4: [ b,b2 ] in X by A3,RELAT_1:def 4;
A5: (the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then reconsider T9 = T as non  empty  reflexive RelStr by A4,ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider b2 as (Element of T9) by A5,A4,ZFMISC_1:87;
b2 <= b2;
then [ b,b2 ] <= [ a9,b2 ] by A2,YELLOW_3:11;
then [ a9,b2 ] in ( uparrow X ) by A4,WAYBEL_0:def 16;
hence thesis by RELAT_1:def 4;
