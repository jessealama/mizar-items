theorem
Th13: (for S,T being  with_infima  antisymmetric RelStr holds (for x,y being (Element of [: S,T :]) holds (( ( x "/\" y ) `1 ) = ( ( x `1 ) "/\" ( y `1 ) ) & ( ( x "/\" y ) `2 ) = ( ( x `2 ) "/\" ( y `2 ) ))))
proof
let S being  with_infima  antisymmetric RelStr;
let T being  with_infima  antisymmetric RelStr;
let x being (Element of [: S,T :]);
let y being (Element of [: S,T :]);
set a = ( ( x "/\" y ) `1 );
set b = ( ( x "/\" y ) `2 );
A1: (the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then A2: x = [ ( x `1 ),( x `2 ) ] by MCART_1:21;
A3: y = [ ( y `1 ),( y `2 ) ] by A1,MCART_1:21;
A4: (for d being (Element of S) holds ((d <= ( x `1 ) & d <= ( y `1 )) implies a >= d))
proof
set t = ( ( x `2 ) "/\" ( y `2 ) );
let d being (Element of S);
assume that
A5: d <= ( x `1 )
and
A6: d <= ( y `1 );
t <= ( y `2 ) by YELLOW_0:23;
then A7: [ d,t ] <= y by A3,A6,YELLOW_3:11;
t <= ( x `2 ) by YELLOW_0:23;
then [ d,t ] <= x by A2,A5,YELLOW_3:11;
then A8: ( x "/\" y ) >= [ d,t ] by A7,YELLOW_0:23;
( [ d,t ] `1 ) = d by MCART_1:7;
hence thesis by A8,YELLOW_3:12;
end;
A9: (for d being (Element of T) holds ((d <= ( x `2 ) & d <= ( y `2 )) implies b >= d))
proof
set s = ( ( x `1 ) "/\" ( y `1 ) );
let d being (Element of T);
assume that
A10: d <= ( x `2 )
and
A11: d <= ( y `2 );
s <= ( y `1 ) by YELLOW_0:23;
then A12: [ s,d ] <= y by A3,A11,YELLOW_3:11;
s <= ( x `1 ) by YELLOW_0:23;
then [ s,d ] <= x by A2,A10,YELLOW_3:11;
then A13: ( x "/\" y ) >= [ s,d ] by A12,YELLOW_0:23;
( [ s,d ] `2 ) = d by MCART_1:7;
hence thesis by A13,YELLOW_3:12;
end;
( x "/\" y ) <= y by YELLOW_0:23;
then A14: (a <= ( y `1 ) & b <= ( y `2 )) by YELLOW_3:12;
( x "/\" y ) <= x by YELLOW_0:23;
then (a <= ( x `1 ) & b <= ( x `2 )) by YELLOW_3:12;
hence thesis by A14,A4,A9,YELLOW_0:19;
