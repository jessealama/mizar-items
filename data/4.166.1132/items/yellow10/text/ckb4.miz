theorem
(for S,T being non empty RelStr holds ([: S,T :] is  lower-bounded implies (S is  lower-bounded & T is  lower-bounded)))
proof
let S being non empty RelStr,T being non empty RelStr;
given x being (Element of [: S,T :]) such that
A1: x is_<=_than (the carrier of [: S,T :]);

(the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then consider s being set,t being set such that A2: s in (the carrier of S) and A3: t in (the carrier of T) and A4: x = [ s,t ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider t as (Element of T) by A3;
reconsider s as (Element of S) by A2;
A5: ((the carrier of S) c= (the carrier of S) & (the carrier of T) c= (the carrier of T));
A6: [ s,t ] is_<=_than [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by A1,A4,YELLOW_3:def 2;
thus S is  lower-bounded
proof
take s;
thus thesis by A5,A6,YELLOW_3:32;
end;

take t;
thus thesis by A5,A6,YELLOW_3:32;
end;
