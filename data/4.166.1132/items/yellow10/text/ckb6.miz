theorem
Th4: (for S,T being  lower-bounded  antisymmetric non  empty RelStr holds ( Bottom [: S,T :] ) = [ ( Bottom S ),( Bottom T ) ])
proof
let S being  lower-bounded  antisymmetric non  empty RelStr;
let T being  lower-bounded  antisymmetric non  empty RelStr;
A1: (for a being (Element of [: S,T :]) holds (( {} ) is_<=_than a implies [ ( Bottom S ),( Bottom T ) ] <= a))
proof
let a being (Element of [: S,T :]);
assume ( {} ) is_<=_than a;
(the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then consider s,t being set such that A2: s in (the carrier of S) and A3: t in (the carrier of T) and A4: a = [ s,t ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider t as (Element of T) by A3;
reconsider s as (Element of S) by A2;
(( Bottom S ) <= s & ( Bottom T ) <= t) by YELLOW_0:44;
hence thesis by A4,YELLOW_3:11;
end;
( ex_sup_of ( {} ),[: S,T :] & ( {} ) is_<=_than [ ( Bottom S ),( Bottom T ) ]) by YELLOW_0:6,YELLOW_0:42;
hence thesis by A1,YELLOW_0:def 9;
