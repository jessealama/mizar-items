theorem
(for S,T being RelStr holds (for X being (Subset of S) holds (for Y being (Subset of T) holds [: ( downarrow X ),( downarrow Y ) :] = ( downarrow [: X,Y :] ))))
proof
let S being RelStr,T being RelStr;
let X being (Subset of S);
let Y being (Subset of T);
hereby
let x being set;
assume x in [: ( downarrow X ),( downarrow Y ) :];
then consider x1 being set,x2 being set such that A1: x1 in ( downarrow X ) and A2: x2 in ( downarrow Y ) and A3: x = [ x1,x2 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider S9 = S,T9 = T as non empty RelStr by A1,A2;
reconsider x1 as (Element of S9) by A1;
consider y1 being (Element of S9) such that A4: (y1 >= x1 & y1 in X) by A1,WAYBEL_0:def 15;
reconsider x2 as (Element of T9) by A2;
consider y2 being (Element of T9) such that A5: (y2 >= x2 & y2 in Y) by A2,WAYBEL_0:def 15;
([ y1,y2 ] in [: X,Y :] & [ y1,y2 ] >= [ x1,x2 ]) by A4,A5,YELLOW_3:11,ZFMISC_1:87;
hence x in ( downarrow [: X,Y :] ) by A3,WAYBEL_0:def 15;
end;
let x being set;
assume A6: x in ( downarrow [: X,Y :] );
A7: (the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then (ex a,b being set st ((a in (the carrier of S) & b in (the carrier of T)) & x = [ a,b ])) by A6,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
then reconsider S9 = S,T9 = T as non empty RelStr;
reconsider x9 = x as (Element of [: S9,T9 :]) by A6;
consider y being (Element of [: S9,T9 :]) such that A8: (y >= x9 & y in [: X,Y :]) by A6,WAYBEL_0:def 15;
(( y `2 ) >= ( x9 `2 ) & ( y `2 ) in Y) by A8,MCART_1:10,YELLOW_3:12;
then A9: ( x `2 ) in ( downarrow Y ) by WAYBEL_0:def 15;
(( y `1 ) >= ( x9 `1 ) & ( y `1 ) in X) by A8,MCART_1:10,YELLOW_3:12;
then A10: ( x `1 ) in ( downarrow X ) by WAYBEL_0:def 15;
x9 = [ ( x9 `1 ),( x9 `2 ) ] by A7,MCART_1:21;
hence thesis by A10,A9,MCART_1:11;
