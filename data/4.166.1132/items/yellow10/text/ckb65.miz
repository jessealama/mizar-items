theorem
(for S,T being  up-complete non  empty Poset holds (for X being (Subset of S) holds (for Y being (Subset of T) holds ((X is  property(S) & Y is  property(S)) implies [: X,Y :] is  property(S)))))
proof
let S being  up-complete non  empty Poset;
let T being  up-complete non  empty Poset;
let X being (Subset of S);
let Y being (Subset of T);
assume that
A1: (for D being non  empty  directed (Subset of S) holds (( sup D ) in X implies (ex y being (Element of S) st (y in D & (for x being (Element of S) holds ((x in D & x >= y) implies x in X))))))
and
A2: (for D being non  empty  directed (Subset of T) holds (( sup D ) in Y implies (ex y being (Element of T) st (y in D & (for x being (Element of T) holds ((x in D & x >= y) implies x in Y))))));
let D being non  empty  directed (Subset of [: S,T :]);
assume that
A3: ( sup D ) in [: X,Y :];
 ex_sup_of D,[: S,T :] by WAYBEL_0:75;
then A4: ( sup D ) = [ ( sup ( proj1 D ) ),( sup ( proj2 D ) ) ] by YELLOW_3:46;
then (( proj1 D ) is non  empty  directed & ( sup ( proj1 D ) ) in X) by A3,YELLOW_3:21,YELLOW_3:22,ZFMISC_1:87;
then consider s being (Element of S) such that A5: s in ( proj1 D ) and A6: (for x being (Element of S) holds ((x in ( proj1 D ) & x >= s) implies x in X)) by A1;
consider s2 being set such that A7: [ s,s2 ] in D by A5,RELAT_1:def 4;
(( proj2 D ) is non  empty  directed & ( sup ( proj2 D ) ) in Y) by A3,A4,YELLOW_3:21,YELLOW_3:22,ZFMISC_1:87;
then consider t being (Element of T) such that A8: t in ( proj2 D ) and A9: (for x being (Element of T) holds ((x in ( proj2 D ) & x >= t) implies x in Y)) by A2;
consider t1 being set such that A10: [ t1,t ] in D by A8,RELAT_1:def 5;
A11: (the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then reconsider s2 as (Element of T) by A7,ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider t1 as (Element of S) by A11,A10,ZFMISC_1:87;
consider z being (Element of [: S,T :]) such that A12: z in D and A13: [ s,s2 ] <= z and A14: [ t1,t ] <= z by A7,A10,WAYBEL_0:def 1;
A15: z = [ ( z `1 ),( z `2 ) ] by A11,MCART_1:21;
then A16: t <= ( z `2 ) by A14,YELLOW_3:11;
take z;
thus z in D by A12;
let x being (Element of [: S,T :]);
assume that
A17: x in D;
assume A18: x >= z;
then A19: ( x `2 ) >= ( z `2 ) by YELLOW_3:12;
A20: x = [ ( x `1 ),( x `2 ) ] by A11,MCART_1:21;
then ( x `2 ) in ( proj2 D ) by A17,FUNCT_5:2;
then A21: ( x `2 ) in Y by A9,A19,A16,ORDERS_2:3;
A22: s <= ( z `1 ) by A13,A15,YELLOW_3:11;
A23: ( x `1 ) >= ( z `1 ) by A18,YELLOW_3:12;
( x `1 ) in ( proj1 D ) by A17,A20,FUNCT_5:2;
then ( x `1 ) in X by A6,A23,A22,ORDERS_2:3;
hence thesis by A20,A21,ZFMISC_1:87;
