theorem
(for S being  reflexive RelStr holds (for T being RelStr holds (for X being (Subset of [: S,T :]) holds ( proj2 ( downarrow X ) ) = ( downarrow ( proj2 X ) ))))
proof
let S being  reflexive RelStr;
let T being RelStr;
let X being (Subset of [: S,T :]);
thus ( proj2 ( downarrow X ) ) c= ( downarrow ( proj2 X ) ) by CKB31:1;
let c being set;
assume A1: c in ( downarrow ( proj2 X ) );
then reconsider T9 = T as non empty RelStr;
reconsider c9 = c as (Element of T9) by A1;
consider b being (Element of T9) such that A2: b >= c9 and A3: b in ( proj2 X ) by A1,WAYBEL_0:def 15;
consider b1 being set such that A4: [ b1,b ] in X by A3,RELAT_1:def 5;
A5: (the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then reconsider S9 = S as non empty  reflexive RelStr by A4,ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider b1 as (Element of S9) by A5,A4,ZFMISC_1:87;
b1 <= b1;
then [ b1,b ] >= [ b1,c9 ] by A2,YELLOW_3:11;
then [ b1,c9 ] in ( downarrow X ) by A4,WAYBEL_0:def 15;
hence thesis by RELAT_1:def 5;
