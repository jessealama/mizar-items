theorem
(for S,T being  up-complete  lower-bounded non  empty Poset holds ([: S,T :] is  continuous implies (S is  continuous & T is  continuous)))
proof
let S being  up-complete  lower-bounded non  empty Poset;
let T being  up-complete  lower-bounded non  empty Poset;
assume that
A1: (for x being (Element of [: S,T :]) holds ( waybelow x ) is non  empty  directed)
and
A2: [: S,T :] is  up-complete  satisfying_axiom_of_approximation;
hereby
hereby
set t = the (Element of T);
let s being (Element of S);
A3: ( waybelow [ s,t ] ) is  directed by A1;
([: ( waybelow s ),( waybelow t ) :] = ( waybelow [ s,t ] ) & ( proj1 [: ( waybelow s ),( waybelow t ) :] ) = ( waybelow s )) by CKB47:1,FUNCT_5:9;
hence ( waybelow s ) is non  empty  directed by A3,YELLOW_3:22;
end;
thus S is  up-complete;
thus S is  satisfying_axiom_of_approximation
proof
set t = the (Element of T);
let s being (Element of S);
( waybelow [ s,t ] ) is  directed by A1;
then  ex_sup_of ( waybelow [ s,t ] ),[: S,T :] by WAYBEL_0:75;
then A4: ( sup ( waybelow [ s,t ] ) ) = [ ( sup ( proj1 ( waybelow [ s,t ] ) ) ),( sup ( proj2 ( waybelow [ s,t ] ) ) ) ] by CKB7:1;
thus s = ( [ s,t ] `1 ) by MCART_1:7
.= ( ( sup ( waybelow [ s,t ] ) ) `1 ) by A2,WAYBEL_3:def 5
.= ( sup ( proj1 ( waybelow [ s,t ] ) ) ) by A4,MCART_1:7
.= ( sup ( waybelow ( [ s,t ] `1 ) ) ) by CKB49:1
.= ( sup ( waybelow s ) ) by MCART_1:7;
end;

end;
hereby
set s = the (Element of S);
let t being (Element of T);
A5: ( waybelow [ s,t ] ) is  directed by A1;
([: ( waybelow s ),( waybelow t ) :] = ( waybelow [ s,t ] ) & ( proj2 [: ( waybelow s ),( waybelow t ) :] ) = ( waybelow t )) by CKB47:1,FUNCT_5:9;
hence ( waybelow t ) is non  empty  directed by A5,YELLOW_3:22;
end;
set s = the (Element of S);
thus T is  up-complete;
let t being (Element of T);
now
let x being (Element of [: S,T :]);
( waybelow x ) is non  empty  directed by A1;
hence  ex_sup_of ( waybelow x ),[: S,T :] by WAYBEL_0:75;
end;
then A6: ( sup ( waybelow [ s,t ] ) ) = [ ( sup ( proj1 ( waybelow [ s,t ] ) ) ),( sup ( proj2 ( waybelow [ s,t ] ) ) ) ] by CKB7:1;
thus t = ( [ s,t ] `2 ) by MCART_1:7
.= ( ( sup ( waybelow [ s,t ] ) ) `2 ) by A2,WAYBEL_3:def 5
.= ( sup ( proj2 ( waybelow [ s,t ] ) ) ) by A6,MCART_1:7
.= ( sup ( waybelow ( [ s,t ] `2 ) ) ) by CKB50:1
.= ( sup ( waybelow t ) ) by MCART_1:7;
