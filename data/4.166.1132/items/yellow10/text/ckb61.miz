theorem
(for S,T being  antisymmetric  up-complete non  empty  reflexive RelStr holds (for X being  upper (Subset of S) holds (for Y being  upper (Subset of T) holds ((X is  inaccessible & Y is  inaccessible) implies [: X,Y :] is  inaccessible))))
proof
let S being  antisymmetric  up-complete non  empty  reflexive RelStr;
let T being  antisymmetric  up-complete non  empty  reflexive RelStr;
let X being  upper (Subset of S);
let Y being  upper (Subset of T);
assume that
A1: (for D being non  empty  directed (Subset of S) holds (( sup D ) in X implies D meets X))
and
A2: (for D being non  empty  directed (Subset of T) holds (( sup D ) in Y implies D meets Y));
let D being non  empty  directed (Subset of [: S,T :]);
assume that
A3: ( sup D ) in [: X,Y :];
 ex_sup_of D,[: S,T :] by WAYBEL_0:75;
then A4: ( sup D ) = [ ( sup ( proj1 D ) ),( sup ( proj2 D ) ) ] by YELLOW_3:46;
then (( proj1 D ) is non  empty  directed & ( sup ( proj1 D ) ) in X) by A3,YELLOW_3:21,YELLOW_3:22,ZFMISC_1:87;
then ( proj1 D ) meets X by A1;
then consider s being set such that A5: s in ( proj1 D ) and A6: s in X by XBOOLE_0:3;
reconsider s as (Element of S) by A5;
consider s2 being set such that A7: [ s,s2 ] in D by A5,RELAT_1:def 4;
(( proj2 D ) is non  empty  directed & ( sup ( proj2 D ) ) in Y) by A3,A4,YELLOW_3:21,YELLOW_3:22,ZFMISC_1:87;
then ( proj2 D ) meets Y by A2;
then consider t being set such that A8: t in ( proj2 D ) and A9: t in Y by XBOOLE_0:3;
reconsider t as (Element of T) by A8;
consider t1 being set such that A10: [ t1,t ] in D by A8,RELAT_1:def 5;
A11: (the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then reconsider s2 as (Element of T) by A7,ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider t1 as (Element of S) by A11,A10,ZFMISC_1:87;
consider z being (Element of [: S,T :]) such that A12: z in D and A13: [ s,s2 ] <= z and A14: [ t1,t ] <= z by A7,A10,WAYBEL_0:def 1;
now
take z;
thus z in D by A12;
A15: z = [ ( z `1 ),( z `2 ) ] by A11,MCART_1:21;
then t <= ( z `2 ) by A14,YELLOW_3:11;
then A16: ( z `2 ) in Y by A9,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
s <= ( z `1 ) by A13,A15,YELLOW_3:11;
then ( z `1 ) in X by A6,WAYBEL_0:def 20;
hence z in [: X,Y :] by A15,A16,ZFMISC_1:87;
end;
hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:3;
