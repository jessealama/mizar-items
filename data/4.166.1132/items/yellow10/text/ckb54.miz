theorem
Th51: (for S,T being  antisymmetric  up-complete non  empty  reflexive RelStr holds (for x being (Element of [: S,T :]) holds (( proj1 ( compactbelow x ) ) c= ( compactbelow ( x `1 ) ) & ( proj2 ( compactbelow x ) ) c= ( compactbelow ( x `2 ) ))))
proof
let S being  antisymmetric  up-complete non  empty  reflexive RelStr;
let T being  antisymmetric  up-complete non  empty  reflexive RelStr;
let x being (Element of [: S,T :]);
A1: (the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then A2: x = [ ( x `1 ),( x `2 ) ] by MCART_1:21;
hereby
let a being set;
assume a in ( proj1 ( compactbelow x ) );
then consider b being set such that A3: [ a,b ] in ( compactbelow x ) by RELAT_1:def 4;
reconsider b as (Element of T) by A1,A3,ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider a9 = a as (Element of S) by A1,A3,ZFMISC_1:87;
(( [ a9,b ] `1 ) = a9 & [ a9,b ] is  compact) by A3,MCART_1:7,WAYBEL_8:4;
then A4: a9 is  compact by CKB25:1;
[ a9,b ] <= x by A3,WAYBEL_8:4;
then a9 <= ( x `1 ) by A2,YELLOW_3:11;
hence a in ( compactbelow ( x `1 ) ) by A4;
end;
let b being set;
assume b in ( proj2 ( compactbelow x ) );
then consider a being set such that A5: [ a,b ] in ( compactbelow x ) by RELAT_1:def 5;
reconsider a as (Element of S) by A1,A5,ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider b9 = b as (Element of T) by A1,A5,ZFMISC_1:87;
(( [ a,b9 ] `2 ) = b9 & [ a,b9 ] is  compact) by A5,MCART_1:7,WAYBEL_8:4;
then A6: b9 is  compact by CKB25:1;
[ a,b9 ] <= x by A5,WAYBEL_8:4;
then b9 <= ( x `2 ) by A2,YELLOW_3:11;
hence thesis by A6;
