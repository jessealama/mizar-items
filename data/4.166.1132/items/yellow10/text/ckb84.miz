theorem
(for S,T being  lower-bounded LATTICE holds ([: S,T :] is  arithmetic implies (S is  arithmetic & T is  arithmetic)))
proof
let S being  lower-bounded LATTICE,T being  lower-bounded LATTICE;
assume that
A1: [: S,T :] is  algebraic
and
A2: ( CompactSublatt [: S,T :] ) is  meet-inheriting;
A3: (S is  up-complete & T is  up-complete) by A1,WAYBEL_2:11;
hereby
thus S is  algebraic by A1,CKB82:1;
let x being (Element of S),y being (Element of S);
assume that
A4: x in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt S ))
and
A5: y in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt S ))
and
 ex_inf_of { x,y },S;
A6: (( [ y,( Bottom T ) ] `1 ) = y & ( [ y,( Bottom T ) ] `2 ) = ( Bottom T )) by MCART_1:7;
y is  compact by A5,WAYBEL_8:def 1;
then [ y,( Bottom T ) ] is  compact by A3,A6,CKB26:1,WAYBEL_3:15;
then A7: [ y,( Bottom T ) ] in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt [: S,T :] )) by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
A8: (( [ x,( Bottom T ) ] `1 ) = x & ( [ x,( Bottom T ) ] `2 ) = ( Bottom T )) by MCART_1:7;
x is  compact by A4,WAYBEL_8:def 1;
then [ x,( Bottom T ) ] is  compact by A3,A8,CKB26:1,WAYBEL_3:15;
then ( ex_inf_of { [ x,( Bottom T ) ],[ y,( Bottom T ) ] },[: S,T :] & [ x,( Bottom T ) ] in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt [: S,T :] ))) by WAYBEL_8:def 1,YELLOW_0:21;
then ( inf { [ x,( Bottom T ) ],[ y,( Bottom T ) ] } ) in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt [: S,T :] )) by A2,A7,YELLOW_0:def 16;
then A9: ( inf { [ x,( Bottom T ) ],[ y,( Bottom T ) ] } ) is  compact by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
( ( inf { [ x,( Bottom T ) ],[ y,( Bottom T ) ] } ) `1 ) = ( ( [ x,( Bottom T ) ] "/\" [ y,( Bottom T ) ] ) `1 ) by YELLOW_0:40
.= ( ( [ x,( Bottom T ) ] `1 ) "/\" ( [ y,( Bottom T ) ] `1 ) ) by CKB15:1
.= ( x "/\" ( [ y,( Bottom T ) ] `1 ) ) by MCART_1:7
.= ( x "/\" y ) by MCART_1:7;
then ( x "/\" y ) is  compact by A3,A9,CKB25:1;
then ( inf { x,y } ) is  compact by YELLOW_0:40;
hence ( inf { x,y } ) in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt S )) by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
end;
thus T is  algebraic by A1,CKB82:1;
let x being (Element of T),y being (Element of T);
assume that
A10: x in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt T ))
and
A11: y in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt T ))
and
 ex_inf_of { x,y },T;
A12: (( [ ( Bottom S ),y ] `2 ) = y & ( [ ( Bottom S ),y ] `1 ) = ( Bottom S )) by MCART_1:7;
y is  compact by A11,WAYBEL_8:def 1;
then [ ( Bottom S ),y ] is  compact by A3,A12,CKB26:1,WAYBEL_3:15;
then A13: [ ( Bottom S ),y ] in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt [: S,T :] )) by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
A14: (( [ ( Bottom S ),x ] `2 ) = x & ( [ ( Bottom S ),x ] `1 ) = ( Bottom S )) by MCART_1:7;
x is  compact by A10,WAYBEL_8:def 1;
then [ ( Bottom S ),x ] is  compact by A3,A14,CKB26:1,WAYBEL_3:15;
then ( ex_inf_of { [ ( Bottom S ),x ],[ ( Bottom S ),y ] },[: S,T :] & [ ( Bottom S ),x ] in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt [: S,T :] ))) by WAYBEL_8:def 1,YELLOW_0:21;
then ( inf { [ ( Bottom S ),x ],[ ( Bottom S ),y ] } ) in (the carrier of ( CompactSublatt [: S,T :] )) by A2,A13,YELLOW_0:def 16;
then A15: ( inf { [ ( Bottom S ),x ],[ ( Bottom S ),y ] } ) is  compact by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
( ( inf { [ ( Bottom S ),x ],[ ( Bottom S ),y ] } ) `2 ) = ( ( [ ( Bottom S ),x ] "/\" [ ( Bottom S ),y ] ) `2 ) by YELLOW_0:40
.= ( ( [ ( Bottom S ),x ] `2 ) "/\" ( [ ( Bottom S ),y ] `2 ) ) by CKB15:1
.= ( x "/\" ( [ ( Bottom S ),y ] `2 ) ) by MCART_1:7
.= ( x "/\" y ) by MCART_1:7;
then ( x "/\" y ) is  compact by A3,A15,CKB25:1;
then ( inf { x,y } ) is  compact by YELLOW_0:40;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_8:def 1;
