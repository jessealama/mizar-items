theorem
Th50: (for S,T being  up-complete non empty Poset holds (for s being (Element of S) holds (for t being (Element of T) holds [: ( compactbelow s ),( compactbelow t ) :] = ( compactbelow [ s,t ] ))))
proof
let S being  up-complete non empty Poset,T being  up-complete non empty Poset;
let s being (Element of S);
let t being (Element of T);
hereby
let x being set;
assume x in [: ( compactbelow s ),( compactbelow t ) :];
then consider x1 being set,x2 being set such that A1: x1 in ( compactbelow s ) and A2: x2 in ( compactbelow t ) and A3: x = [ x1,x2 ] by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
reconsider x2 as (Element of T) by A2;
reconsider x1 as (Element of S) by A1;
(s >= x1 & t >= x2) by A1,A2,WAYBEL_8:4;
then A4: [ s,t ] >= [ x1,x2 ] by YELLOW_3:11;
A5: (( [ x1,x2 ] `1 ) = x1 & ( [ x1,x2 ] `2 ) = x2) by MCART_1:7;
(x1 is  compact & x2 is  compact) by A1,A2,WAYBEL_8:4;
then [ x1,x2 ] is  compact by A5,CKB26:1;
hence x in ( compactbelow [ s,t ] ) by A3,A4;
end;
let x being set;
assume A6: x in ( compactbelow [ s,t ] );
then reconsider x9 = x as (Element of [: S,T :]);
A7: x9 is  compact by A6,WAYBEL_8:4;
then A8: ( x9 `1 ) is  compact by CKB25:1;
A9: ( x9 `2 ) is  compact by A7,CKB25:1;
(the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then A10: x9 = [ ( x9 `1 ),( x9 `2 ) ] by MCART_1:21;
A11: [ s,t ] >= x9 by A6,WAYBEL_8:4;
then t >= ( x9 `2 ) by A10,YELLOW_3:11;
then A12: ( x `2 ) in ( compactbelow t ) by A9;
s >= ( x9 `1 ) by A10,A11,YELLOW_3:11;
then ( x `1 ) in ( compactbelow s ) by A8;
hence thesis by A10,A12,MCART_1:11;
