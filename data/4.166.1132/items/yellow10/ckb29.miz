theorem
(for S,T being RelStr holds (for X being (Subset of [: S,T :]) holds ( downarrow X ) c= [: ( downarrow ( proj1 X ) ),( downarrow ( proj2 X ) ) :]))
proof
let S being RelStr,T being RelStr;
let X being (Subset of [: S,T :]);
let x being set;
assume A1: x in ( downarrow X );
A2: (the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then (ex a,b being set st ((a in (the carrier of S) & b in (the carrier of T)) & x = [ a,b ])) by A1,ZFMISC_1:def 2;
then reconsider S9 = S,T9 = T as non empty RelStr;
reconsider x9 = x as (Element of [: S9,T9 :]) by A1;
consider y being (Element of [: S9,T9 :]) such that A3: y >= x9 and A4: y in X by A1,WAYBEL_0:def 15;
A5: ( y `1 ) >= ( x9 `1 ) by A3,YELLOW_3:12;
A6: y = [ ( y `1 ),( y `2 ) ] by A2,MCART_1:21;
then ( y `1 ) in ( proj1 X ) by A4,FUNCT_5:2;
then A7: ( x `1 ) in ( downarrow ( proj1 X ) ) by A5,WAYBEL_0:def 15;
A8: ( y `2 ) >= ( x9 `2 ) by A3,YELLOW_3:12;
( y `2 ) in ( proj2 X ) by A4,A6,FUNCT_5:2;
then A9: ( x `2 ) in ( downarrow ( proj2 X ) ) by A8,WAYBEL_0:def 15;
x9 = [ ( x9 `1 ),( x9 `2 ) ] by A2,MCART_1:21;
hence thesis by A7,A9,MCART_1:11;
