theorem
Th19: (for S,T being  up-complete non empty Poset holds (for a,c being (Element of S) holds (for b,d being (Element of T) holds ([ a,b ] << [ c,d ] iff (a << c & b << d)))))
proof
let S being  up-complete non empty Poset,T being  up-complete non empty Poset;
let a being (Element of S),c being (Element of S);
let b being (Element of T),d being (Element of T);
thus ([ a,b ] << [ c,d ] implies (a << c & b << d)) by CKB21:1;
assume A1: (for D being non empty  directed (Subset of S) holds (c <= ( sup D ) implies (ex e being (Element of S) st (e in D & a <= e))));
assume A2: (for D being non empty  directed (Subset of T) holds (d <= ( sup D ) implies (ex e being (Element of T) st (e in D & b <= e))));
let D being non empty  directed (Subset of [: S,T :]);
assume that
A3: [ c,d ] <= ( sup D );
 ex_sup_of D,[: S,T :] by WAYBEL_0:75;
then A4: ( sup D ) = [ ( sup ( proj1 D ) ),( sup ( proj2 D ) ) ] by YELLOW_3:46;
then (( proj1 D ) is non empty  directed & c <= ( sup ( proj1 D ) )) by A3,YELLOW_3:11,YELLOW_3:21,YELLOW_3:22;
then consider e being (Element of S) such that A5: e in ( proj1 D ) and A6: a <= e by A1;
consider e2 being set such that A7: [ e,e2 ] in D by A5,RELAT_1:def 4;
(( proj2 D ) is non empty  directed & d <= ( sup ( proj2 D ) )) by A3,A4,YELLOW_3:11,YELLOW_3:21,YELLOW_3:22;
then consider f being (Element of T) such that A8: f in ( proj2 D ) and A9: b <= f by A2;
consider f1 being set such that A10: [ f1,f ] in D by A8,RELAT_1:def 5;
A11: (the carrier of [: S,T :]) = [: (the carrier of S),(the carrier of T) :] by YELLOW_3:def 2;
then reconsider e2 as (Element of T) by A7,ZFMISC_1:87;
reconsider f1 as (Element of S) by A11,A10,ZFMISC_1:87;
consider ef being (Element of [: S,T :]) such that A12: ef in D and A13: ([ e,e2 ] <= ef & [ f1,f ] <= ef) by A7,A10,WAYBEL_0:def 1;
A14: ef = [ ( ef `1 ),( ef `2 ) ] by A11,MCART_1:21;
then (e <= ( ef `1 ) & f <= ( ef `2 )) by A13,YELLOW_3:11;
then A15: [ e,f ] <= ef by A14,YELLOW_3:11;
take ef;
thus ef in D by A12;
[ a,b ] <= [ e,f ] by A6,A9,YELLOW_3:11;
hence thesis by A15,ORDERS_2:3;
