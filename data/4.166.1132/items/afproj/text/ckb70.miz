theorem
Th44: (for a,b,c,d,p being (Element of (the Points of ( ProjHorizon AS ))) holds (for M,N,P,Q being (Element of (the Lines of ( ProjHorizon AS ))) holds (((((((((((((a on M & b on M) & c on N) & d on N) & p on M) & p on N) & a on P) & c on P) & b on Q) & d on Q) & (not p on P)) & (not p on Q)) & M <> N) implies (ex q being (Element of (the Points of ( ProjHorizon AS ))) st (q on P & q on Q)))))
proof
let a being (Element of (the Points of ( ProjHorizon AS ))),b being (Element of (the Points of ( ProjHorizon AS ))),c being (Element of (the Points of ( ProjHorizon AS ))),d being (Element of (the Points of ( ProjHorizon AS ))),p being (Element of (the Points of ( ProjHorizon AS )));
let M being (Element of (the Lines of ( ProjHorizon AS ))),N being (Element of (the Lines of ( ProjHorizon AS ))),P being (Element of (the Lines of ( ProjHorizon AS ))),Q being (Element of (the Lines of ( ProjHorizon AS )));
assume that
A1: a on M
and
A2: b on M
and
A3: c on N
and
A4: d on N
and
A5: p on M
and
A6: p on N
and
A7: a on P
and
A8: c on P
and
A9: b on Q
and
A10: d on Q
and
A11: (not p on P)
and
A12: (not p on Q)
and
A13: M <> N;
reconsider M9 = [ M,2 ],N9 = [ N,2 ],P9 = [ P,2 ],Q9 = [ Q,2 ] as (LINE of ( IncProjSp_of AS )) by CKB39:1;
reconsider a9 = a,b9 = b,c9 = c,d9 = d,p9 = p as (POINT of ( IncProjSp_of AS )) by CKB36:1;
A14: b9 on M9 by A2,CKB51:1;
A15: M9 <> N9
proof
assume M9 = N9;
then M = ( [ N,2 ] `1 ) by MCART_1:7
.= N by MCART_1:7;
hence contradiction by A13;
end;
A16: d9 on N9 by A4,CKB51:1;
A17: c9 on N9 by A3,CKB51:1;
A18: c9 on P9 by A8,CKB51:1;
A19: a9 on P9 by A7,CKB51:1;
A20: p9 on N9 by A6,CKB51:1;
A21: p9 on M9 by A5,CKB51:1;
A22: (not p9 on Q9) by A12,CKB51:1;
A23: (not p9 on P9) by A11,CKB51:1;
A24: d9 on Q9 by A10,CKB51:1;
A25: b9 on Q9 by A9,CKB51:1;
a9 on M9 by A1,CKB51:1;
then consider q9 being (POINT of ( IncProjSp_of AS )) such that A26: q9 on P9 and A27: q9 on Q9 by A14,A17,A16,A21,A20,A19,A18,A25,A24,A23,A22,A15,CKB69:1;
[ q9,[ P,2 ] ] in (the Inc of ( IncProjSp_of AS )) by A26,INCSP_1:def 1;
then reconsider q = q9 as (Element of (the Points of ( ProjHorizon AS ))) by CKB62:1;
take q;
thus thesis by A26,A27,CKB51:1;
