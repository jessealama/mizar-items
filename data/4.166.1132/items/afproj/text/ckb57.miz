theorem
Lm3: (ex a st (ex b st (ex c st (((((a on A & b on A) & c on A) & a <> b) & b <> c) & c <> a))))
proof
consider X such that A1: ((A = [ X,1 ] & X is  being_line) or (A = [ ( PDir X ),2 ] & X is  being_plane)) by CKB37:1;
A2:now
assume that
A3: A = [ ( PDir X ),2 ]
and
A4: X is  being_plane;
consider x,y,z such that A5: x in X and A6: y in X and A7: z in X and A8: (not  LIN x,y,z) by A4,AFF_4:34;
A9: y <> z by A8,AFF_1:7;
then A10: ( Line (y,z) ) is  being_line by AFF_1:def 3;
then A11: ( Line (y,z) ) '||' X by A4,A6,A7,A9,AFF_4:19,AFF_4:42;
A12: z <> x by A8,AFF_1:7;
then A13: ( Line (x,z) ) is  being_line by AFF_1:def 3;
then A14: ( Line (x,z) ) '||' X by A4,A5,A7,A12,AFF_4:19,AFF_4:42;
A15: x <> y by A8,AFF_1:7;
then A16: ( Line (x,y) ) is  being_line by AFF_1:def 3;
then reconsider a = ( LDir ( Line (x,y) ) ),b = ( LDir ( Line (y,z) ) ),c = ( LDir ( Line (x,z) ) ) as (POINT of ( IncProjSp_of AS )) by A10,A13,CKB34:1;
take a;
take b;
take c;
( Line (x,y) ) '||' X by A4,A5,A6,A15,A16,AFF_4:19,AFF_4:42;
hence ((a on A & b on A) & c on A) by A3,A4,A16,A10,A13,A11,A14,CKB43:1;
A17: x in ( Line (x,y) ) by AFF_1:15;
A18: z in ( Line (y,z) ) by AFF_1:15;
A19: y in ( Line (x,y) ) by AFF_1:15;
A20: y in ( Line (y,z) ) by AFF_1:15;
thus a <> b
proof
assume (not thesis);
then ( Line (x,y) ) // ( Line (y,z) ) by A16,A10,CKB17:1;
then z in ( Line (x,y) ) by A19,A20,A18,AFF_1:45;
hence contradiction by A8,A16,A17,A19,AFF_1:21;
end;

A21: z in ( Line (x,z) ) by AFF_1:15;
A22: x in ( Line (x,z) ) by AFF_1:15;
thus b <> c
proof
assume (not thesis);
then ( Line (y,z) ) // ( Line (x,z) ) by A10,A13,CKB17:1;
then x in ( Line (y,z) ) by A18,A22,A21,AFF_1:45;
hence contradiction by A8,A10,A20,A18,AFF_1:21;
end;

thus c <> a
proof
assume (not thesis);
then ( Line (x,y) ) // ( Line (x,z) ) by A16,A13,CKB17:1;
then z in ( Line (x,y) ) by A17,A22,A21,AFF_1:45;
hence contradiction by A8,A16,A17,A19,AFF_1:21;
end;

end;
now
assume that
A23: A = [ X,1 ]
and
A24: X is  being_line;
reconsider c = ( LDir X ) as (POINT of ( IncProjSp_of AS )) by A24,CKB34:1;
consider x,y such that A25: x in X and A26: y in X and A27: x <> y by A24,AFF_1:19;
reconsider a = x,b = y as (Element of (the Points of ( IncProjSp_of AS ))) by CKB34:1;
take a;
take b;
take c;
X // X by A24,AFF_1:41;
then X '||' X by A24,AFF_4:40;
hence ((a on A & b on A) & c on A) by A23,A24,A25,A26,CKB40:1,CKB42:1;
thus a <> b by A27;
thus (b <> c & c <> a)
proof
assume A28: (not thesis);
c in ( Dir_of_Lines AS ) by A24,CKB22:1;
then ( (the carrier of AS) /\ ( Dir_of_Lines AS ) ) <> ( {} ) by A28,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then (the carrier of AS) meets ( Dir_of_Lines AS ) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
hence contradiction by CKB24:1;
end;

end;
hence thesis by A1,A2;
end;
