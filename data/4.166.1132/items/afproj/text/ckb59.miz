theorem
Lm5: (AS is AffinPlane implies (ex a st (a on A & a on K)))
proof
consider X such that A1: ((A = [ X,1 ] & X is  being_line) or (A = [ ( PDir X ),2 ] & X is  being_plane)) by CKB37:1;
consider X9 such that A2: ((K = [ X9,1 ] & X9 is  being_line) or (K = [ ( PDir X9 ),2 ] & X9 is  being_plane)) by CKB37:1;
assume A3: AS is AffinPlane;

A5: A = [ X,1 ]
and
A6: X is  being_line;
A7:now
assume that
A8: K = [ X9,1 ]
and

reconsider a = ( LDir X ),b = ( LDir X9 ) as (Element of (the Points of ( IncProjSp_of AS ))) by A6,A9,CKB34:1;
X9 // X9 by A9,AFF_1:41;
then A11: X9 '||' X9 by A9,AFF_4:40;
assume X // X9;
then A12: a = b by A6,A9,CKB17:1;
take a;
X // X by A6,AFF_1:41;
then X '||' X by A6,AFF_4:40;
hence (a on A & a on K) by A5,A6,A8,A9,A12,A11,CKB42:1;
end;
now
assume (not X // X9);
then consider x such that A13: x in X and A14: x in X9 by A3,A6,A9,AFF_1:58;
reconsider a = x as (Element of (the Points of ( IncProjSp_of AS ))) by CKB34:1;

thus (a on A & a on K) by A5,A6,A8,A9,A13,A14,CKB40:1;
end;
hence thesis by A10;

take a;
X9 = (the carrier of AS) by A3,A17,CKB2:1;
