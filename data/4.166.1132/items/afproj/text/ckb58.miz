theorem
Lm4: (ex A st (a on A & b on A))
proof
A1:now
given X such that
A2: a = ( LDir X )
and
A3: X is  being_line;

A4:now
given X9 such that
A5: b = ( LDir X9 )
and
A6: X9 is  being_line;

consider x,y being (Element of AS) such that A7: x in X9 and y in X9 and x <> y by A6,AFF_1:19;
A8: x in ( x * X ) by A3,AFF_4:def 3;
( x * X ) is  being_line by A3,AFF_4:27;
then consider Z such that A9: X9 c= Z and A10: ( x * X ) c= Z and A11: Z is  being_plane by A6,A7,A8,AFF_4:38;
A12: X9 '||' Z by A6,A9,A11,AFF_4:42;
reconsider A = [ ( PDir Z ),2 ] as (LINE of ( IncProjSp_of AS )) by A11,CKB37:1;
take A;
X // ( x * X ) by A3,AFF_4:def 3;
then X '||' Z by A3,A10,A11,AFF_4:41;
hence (a on A & b on A) by A2,A3,A5,A6,A11,A12,CKB43:1;
end;
now
assume b is (Element of AS);
then reconsider y = b as (Element of AS);
A13: ( y * X ) is  being_line by A3,AFF_4:27;
then reconsider A = [ ( y * X ),1 ] as (LINE of ( IncProjSp_of AS )) by CKB37:1;
take A;
X // ( y * X ) by A3,AFF_4:def 3;
then X '||' ( y * X ) by A3,A13,AFF_4:40;
hence a on A by A2,A3,A13,CKB42:1;
y in ( y * X ) by A3,AFF_4:def 3;
hence b on A by A13,CKB40:1;
end;
hence thesis by A4,CKB34:1;
end;
now
assume a is (Element of AS);
then reconsider x = a as (Element of AS);
A14:now
given X9 such that
A15: b = ( LDir X9 )
and
A16: X9 is  being_line;

A17: ( x * X9 ) is  being_line by A16,AFF_4:27;
then reconsider A = [ ( x * X9 ),1 ] as (LINE of ( IncProjSp_of AS )) by CKB37:1;
take A;
x in ( x * X9 ) by A16,AFF_4:def 3;
hence a on A by A17,CKB40:1;
X9 // ( x * X9 ) by A16,AFF_4:def 3;
then X9 '||' ( x * X9 ) by A16,A17,AFF_4:40;
hence b on A by A15,A16,A17,CKB42:1;
end;
now
assume b is (Element of AS);
then reconsider y = b as (Element of AS);
consider Y such that A18: x in Y and A19: y in Y and A20: Y is  being_line by AFF_4:11;
reconsider A = [ Y,1 ] as (LINE of ( IncProjSp_of AS )) by A20,CKB37:1;
take A;
thus (a on A & b on A) by A18,A19,A20,CKB40:1;
end;
hence thesis by A14,CKB34:1;
end;
hence thesis by A1,CKB34:1;
