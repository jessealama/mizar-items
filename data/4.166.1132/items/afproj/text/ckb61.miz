theorem
Th41: (for x,y being (Element of (the Points of ( ProjHorizon AS ))) holds (for X being (Element of (the Lines of ( IncProjSp_of AS ))) holds (((x <> y & [ x,X ] in (the Inc of ( IncProjSp_of AS ))) & [ y,X ] in (the Inc of ( IncProjSp_of AS ))) implies (ex Y being (Element of (the Lines of ( ProjHorizon AS ))) st X = [ Y,2 ]))))
proof
let x being (Element of (the Points of ( ProjHorizon AS )));
let y being (Element of (the Points of ( ProjHorizon AS )));
let X being (Element of (the Lines of ( IncProjSp_of AS )));
reconsider a = x,b = y as (POINT of ( IncProjSp_of AS )) by CKB36:1;
assume that
A1: x <> y
and
A2: [ x,X ] in (the Inc of ( IncProjSp_of AS ))
and
A3: [ y,X ] in (the Inc of ( IncProjSp_of AS ));
A4: b on X by A3,INCSP_1:def 1;
consider Y being (Element of (the Lines of ( ProjHorizon AS ))) such that A5: x on Y and A6: y on Y by CKB54:1;
reconsider A = [ Y,2 ] as (LINE of ( IncProjSp_of AS )) by CKB39:1;
consider Z being (Subset of AS) such that A7: Y = ( PDir Z ) and A8: Z is  being_plane by CKB23:1;

X2 '||' Z by A9,A10,A6,A7,A8,CKB50:1;
then A11: b on A by A9,A10,A7,A8,CKB43:1;
take Y;
consider X1 being (Subset of AS) such that A12: x = ( LDir X1 ) and A13: X1 is  being_line by CKB22:1;
X1 '||' Z by A12,A13,A5,A7,A8,CKB50:1;
then A14: a on A by A12,A13,A7,A8,CKB43:1;
