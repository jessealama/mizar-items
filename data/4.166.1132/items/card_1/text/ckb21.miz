theorem
Th28: (( card X ) c= ( card Y ) iff (ex f st (( dom f ) = Y & X c= ( rng f ))))
proof
thus (( card X ) c= ( card Y ) implies (ex f st (( dom f ) = Y & X c= ( rng f ))))
proof
assume ( card X ) c= ( card Y );
then consider f such that A1: f is  one-to-one and A2: ( dom f ) = X and A3: ( rng f ) c= Y by CKB19:1;
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(($1 in ( rng f ) & $2 = ( ( f " ) . $1 )) or ((not $1 in ( rng f )) & $2 = ( 0 )));
A4: (for x holds (x in Y implies (ex y st P[ x,y ])))
proof
let x;
assume that
x in Y;
((not x in ( rng f )) implies thesis);
hence thesis;
end;
A5: (for x holds (for y holds (for z holds (((x in Y & P[ x,y ]) & P[ x,z ]) implies y = z))));
consider g such that A6: (( dom g ) = Y & (for y holds (y in Y implies P[ y,( g . y ) ]))) from FUNCT_1:sch 2(A5,A4);
take g;
thus ( dom g ) = Y by A6;
let x;
assume A7: x in X;
then A8: ( f . x ) in ( rng f ) by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
( ( f " ) . ( f . x ) ) = x by A1,A2,A7,FUNCT_1:34;
then x = ( g . ( f . x ) ) by A3,A6,A8;
hence thesis by A3,A6,A8,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;

given f such that
A9: ( dom f ) = Y
and
A10: X c= ( rng f );

deffunc f(set) = ( f " { $1 } );
consider g such that A11: (( dom g ) = X & (for x holds (x in X implies ( g . x ) = f(x)))) from FUNCT_1:sch 3;
(X <> ( {} ) implies thesis)
proof
assume X <> ( {} );
then reconsider M = ( rng g ) as non  empty set by A11,RELAT_1:42;
(for Z holds (Z in M implies Z <> ( {} )))
proof
let Z;
assume Z in M;
then consider x such that A12: (x in ( dom g ) & Z = ( g . x )) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
A13: x in { x } by TARSKI:def 1;
(Z = ( f " { x } ) & (ex y st (y in ( dom f ) & x = ( f . y )))) by A10,A11,A12,FUNCT_1:def 3;

end;

A16: ( dom ( F * g ) ) = X by A11,A14,RELAT_1:27;
A17: ( F * g ) is  one-to-one
proof
let x;
let y;
assume that
A18: x in ( dom ( F * g ) )
and
A19: y in ( dom ( F * g ) )
and
A20: ( ( F * g ) . x ) = ( ( F * g ) . y );
A21: ( g . y ) = ( f " { y } ) by A11,A16,A19;
then ( f " { y } ) in M by A11,A16,A19,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then ( F . ( f " { y } ) ) in ( f " { y } ) by A15;

A23: ( g . x ) = ( f " { x } ) by A11,A16,A18;

then ( F . ( f " { x } ) ) in ( f " { x } ) by A15;
then ( f . ( F . ( f " { x } ) ) ) in { x } by FUNCT_1:def 7;
then A24: ( f . ( F . ( f " { x } ) ) ) = x by TARSKI:def 1;
(( ( F * g ) . x ) = ( F . ( g . x ) ) & ( ( F * g ) . y ) = ( F . ( g . y ) )) by A11,A16,A18,A19,FUNCT_1:13;
hence thesis by A20,A23,A21,A22,A24,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
( rng ( F * g ) ) c= Y
proof
let x;
assume x in ( rng ( F * g ) );
then consider y such that A25: y in ( dom ( F * g ) ) and A26: x = ( ( F * g ) . y ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
