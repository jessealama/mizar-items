theorem
Th61: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds ((for f being (RealMap of T) holds (f is  continuous implies f is  bounded)) iff (for f being (RealMap of T) holds (f is  continuous implies f is  with_max))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
set cT = (the carrier of T);
hereby
assume A1: (for f being (RealMap of T) holds (f is  continuous implies f is  bounded));
let f being (RealMap of T);
assume that
A2: f is  continuous;
set fcT = ( f .: cT );
f is  bounded by A1,A2;
then A3: fcT is  bounded_above by MEASURE6:def 11;
set b = ( upper_bound fcT );
set bf = ( b + ( - f ) );
( - f ) is  continuous by A2,CKB18:1;
then A4: bf is  continuous by CKB19:1;
reconsider bf9 = bf as (Function of cT,( REAL ));
reconsider f9 = f as (Function of cT,( REAL ));
set g = ( Inv bf );
set gcT = ( g .: cT );
assume (not f is  with_max);
then A5: (not fcT is  with_max) by MEASURE6:def 12;
then A6: (not ( upper_bound fcT ) in fcT) by A3,MEASURE6:def 4;
now
assume ( 0 ) in ( rng bf );
then consider x being set such that A7: x in ( dom bf ) and A8: ( bf . x ) = ( 0 ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider x as (Element of cT) by A7;
( bf9 . x ) = ( b + ( ( - f9 ) . x ) ) by VALUED_1:2
.= ( b + ( - ( f . x ) ) ) by VALUED_1:8
.= ( b - ( f . x ) );
hence contradiction by A6,A8,FUNCT_2:35;
end;
then A9: g is  continuous by A4,CKB20:1;
now
g is  bounded by A1,A9;
then gcT is  bounded_above by MEASURE6:def 11;
then consider p being  real number such that A10: p is (UpperBound of gcT) by XXREAL_2:def 10;
A11: (for r being  real number holds (r in gcT implies r <= p)) by A10,XXREAL_2:def 1;
per cases ;
suppose A12: p <= ( 0 );

reconsider a19 = 1 as  real number;
take a19;
thus a19 > ( 0 );
let r being  real number;
assume r in gcT;
hence r <= a19 by A11,A12;
end;
suppose A13: p > ( 0 );

take p;
thus p > ( 0 ) by A13;
thus (for r being  real number holds (r in gcT implies r <= p)) by A11;
end;
end;
then consider p being  real number such that A14: p > ( 0 ) and A15: (for r being  real number holds (r in gcT implies r <= p));
consider r being  real number such that A16: r in fcT and A17: ( b - ( 1 / p ) ) < r by A3,A14,SEQ_4:def 1;
consider x being set such that A18: x in (the carrier of T) and x in (the carrier of T) and A19: r = ( f . x ) by A16,FUNCT_2:64;
reconsider x as (Element of T) by A18;
A20: ( f . x ) <= b by A3,A16,A19,SEQ_4:def 1;
( f . x ) <> b by A3,A5,A16,A19,MEASURE6:def 4;
then ( ( f . x ) + ( 0 ) ) < b by A20,XXREAL_0:1;
then A21: ( b - ( f . x ) ) > ( 0 ) by XREAL_1:20;
( g . x ) = ( ( bf9 . x ) " ) by VALUED_1:10
.= ( ( b + ( ( - f9 ) . x ) ) " ) by VALUED_1:2
.= ( 1 / ( b + ( ( - f9 ) . x ) ) )
.= ( 1 / ( b + ( - ( f . x ) ) ) ) by VALUED_1:8
.= ( 1 / ( b - ( f . x ) ) );
then ( 1 / ( b - ( f . x ) ) ) <= p by A15,FUNCT_2:35;
then 1 <= ( p * ( b - ( f . x ) ) ) by A21,XREAL_1:81;
then ( 1 / p ) <= ( b - ( f . x ) ) by A14,XREAL_1:79;
then ( ( f . x ) + ( 1 / p ) ) <= b by XREAL_1:19;
hence contradiction by A17,A19,XREAL_1:19;
end;
assume A22: (for f being (RealMap of T) holds (f is  continuous implies f is  with_max));
let f being (RealMap of T);
assume A23: f is  continuous;
then f is  with_max by A22;
then ( f .: (the carrier of T) ) is  with_max by MEASURE6:def 12;
then ( f .: (the carrier of T) ) is  bounded_above;
hence f is  bounded_above by MEASURE6:def 11;
f is  with_min by A22,A23,CKB26:1;
then ( f .: (the carrier of T) ) is  with_min by MEASURE6:def 13;
then ( f .: (the carrier of T) ) is  bounded_below;
hence thesis by MEASURE6:def 10;
