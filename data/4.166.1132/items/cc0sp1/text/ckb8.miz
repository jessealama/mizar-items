coherence
proof
set W = ( ComplexBoundedFunctions X );
set V = ( CAlgebra X );
(for v,u being (Element of V) holds ((v in W & u in W) implies ( v + u ) in W))
proof
let v being (Element of V);
let u being (Element of V);
assume that
A2: (v in W & u in W);
consider v1 being (Function of X,( COMPLEX )) such that A3: (v1 = v & ( v1 | X ) is  bounded) by A2;
consider u1 being (Function of X,( COMPLEX )) such that A4: (u1 = u & ( u1 | X ) is  bounded) by A2;
( dom ( v1 + u1 ) ) = ( X /\ X ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A5: (( v1 + u1 ) is (Function of X,( COMPLEX )) & ( ( v1 + u1 ) | X ) is  bounded) by A3,A4,CFUNCT_1:75;
reconsider h = ( v + u ) as (Element of ( Funcs (X,( COMPLEX )) ));
A6: (ex f being Function st ((h = f & ( dom f ) = X) & ( rng f ) c= ( COMPLEX ))) by FUNCT_2:def 2;
( ( dom v1 ) /\ ( dom u1 ) ) = ( X /\ ( dom u1 ) ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A7: ( ( dom v1 ) /\ ( dom u1 ) ) = ( X /\ X ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
(for x being set holds (x in ( dom h ) implies ( h . x ) = ( ( v1 . x ) + ( u1 . x ) ))) by A3,A4,CFUNCDOM:1;
then ( v + u ) = ( v1 + u1 ) by A7,A6,VALUED_1:def 1;
hence ( v + u ) in W by A5;
end;
then A8: W is  add-closed by IDEAL_1:def 1;
(for v being (Element of V) holds (v in W implies ( - v ) in W))
proof
let v being (Element of V);
assume that
A9: v in W;
consider v1 being (Function of X,( COMPLEX )) such that A10: (v1 = v & ( v1 | X ) is  bounded) by A9;
A11: (( - v1 ) is (Function of X,( COMPLEX )) & ( ( - v1 ) | X ) is  bounded) by A10,CFUNCT_1:74;

A14: ( dom v1 ) = X by FUNCT_2:def 1;
now
let x being set;
assume x in ( dom h );
then reconsider y = x as (Element of X);
( h . x ) = ( ( - ( 1r ) ) * ( v2 . y ) ) by A12,CFUNCDOM:4;
hence ( h . x ) = ( - ( v1 . x ) ) by A10;
end;
then ( - v ) = ( - v1 ) by A14,A13,VALUED_1:9;
hence ( - v ) in W by A11;
end;
then A15: W is  having-inverse by C0SP1:def 1;
(for a being Complex holds (for u being (Element of V) holds (u in W implies ( a * u ) in W)))
proof
let a being Complex;
let u being (Element of V);
assume that
A16: u in W;
consider u1 being (Function of X,( COMPLEX )) such that A17: (u1 = u & ( u1 | X ) is  bounded) by A16;
A18: (( a (#) u1 ) is (Function of X,( COMPLEX )) & ( ( a (#) u1 ) | X ) is  bounded) by A17,CFUNCT_1:72;
reconsider h = ( a * u ) as (Element of ( Funcs (X,( COMPLEX )) ));
A19: (ex f being Function st ((h = f & ( dom f ) = X) & ( rng f ) c= ( COMPLEX ))) by FUNCT_2:def 2;
A20: ( dom u1 ) = X by FUNCT_2:def 1;
(for x being set holds (x in ( dom h ) implies ( h . x ) = ( a * ( u1 . x ) ))) by A17,CFUNCDOM:4;
then ( a * u ) = ( a (#) u1 ) by A20,A19,VALUED_1:def 5;
hence ( a * u ) in W by A18;
end;
hence ( ComplexBoundedFunctions X ) is  Cadditively-linearly-closed by A8,A15,CKB4:def 1;
A21: (for v,u being (Element of V) holds ((v in W & u in W) implies ( v * u ) in W))
proof
let v being (Element of V);
let u being (Element of V);
assume that
A22: (v in W & u in W);
consider v1 being (Function of X,( COMPLEX )) such that A23: (v1 = v & ( v1 | X ) is  bounded) by A22;
consider u1 being (Function of X,( COMPLEX )) such that A24: (u1 = u & ( u1 | X ) is  bounded) by A22;
( dom ( v1 (#) u1 ) ) = ( X /\ X ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A25: (( v1 (#) u1 ) is (Function of X,( COMPLEX )) & ( ( v1 (#) u1 ) | X ) is  bounded) by A23,A24,CFUNCT_1:76;
reconsider h = ( v * u ) as (Element of ( Funcs (X,( COMPLEX )) ));
A26: (ex f being Function st ((h = f & ( dom f ) = X) & ( rng f ) c= ( COMPLEX ))) by FUNCT_2:def 2;
( ( dom v1 ) /\ ( dom u1 ) ) = ( X /\ ( dom u1 ) ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
then A27: ( ( dom v1 ) /\ ( dom u1 ) ) = ( X /\ X ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
(for x being set holds (x in ( dom h ) implies ( h . x ) = ( ( v1 . x ) * ( u1 . x ) ))) by A23,A24,CFUNCDOM:2;
then ( v * u ) = ( v1 (#) u1 ) by A27,A26,VALUED_1:def 4;
hence ( v * u ) in W by A25;
end;
reconsider g = ( ComplexFuncUnit X ) as (Function of X,( COMPLEX ));
( g | X ) is  bounded;
then ( 1. V ) in W;
hence thesis by A21,C0SP1:def 4;
