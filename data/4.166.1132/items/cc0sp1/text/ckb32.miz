theorem
Th18: (for W being Normed_Complex_AlgebraStr holds (for V being ComplexAlgebra holds (ComplexAlgebraStr (# (the carrier of W),(the multF of W),(the addF of W),(the Mult of W),(the OneF of W),(the ZeroF of W) #) = V implies W is ComplexAlgebra)))
proof
let W being Normed_Complex_AlgebraStr;
let V being ComplexAlgebra;
assume A1: ComplexAlgebraStr (# (the carrier of W),(the multF of W),(the addF of W),(the Mult of W),(the OneF of W),(the ZeroF of W) #) = V;
reconsider W as non  empty ComplexAlgebraStr by A1;
A2: W is  right_unital
proof
let x being (Element of W);
reconsider x1 = x as (Element of V) by A1;
( x * ( 1. W ) ) = ( x1 * ( 1. V ) ) by A1;
hence ( x * ( 1. W ) ) = x by VECTSP_1:def 4;
end;
A3: W is  right-distributive
proof
let x being (Element of W);
let y being (Element of W);
let z being (Element of W);
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y,z1 = z as (Element of V) by A1;
( x * ( y + z ) ) = ( x1 * ( y1 + z1 ) ) by A1;
then ( x * ( y + z ) ) = ( ( x1 * y1 ) + ( x1 * z1 ) ) by VECTSP_1:def 2;
hence ( x * ( y + z ) ) = ( ( x * y ) + ( x * z ) ) by A1;
end;
A4: (for x being (Element of W) holds x is  right_complementable)
proof
let x being (Element of W);
reconsider x1 = x as (Element of V) by A1;
consider v being (Element of V) such that A5: ( x1 + v ) = ( 0. V ) by ALGSTR_0:def 11;
reconsider y = v as (Element of W) by A1;
( x + y ) = ( 0. W ) by A1,A5;
hence x is  right_complementable by ALGSTR_0:def 11;
end;
A6: (for a,b,x being (Element of W) holds ( ( a * b ) * x ) = ( a * ( b * x ) ))
proof
let a being (Element of W);
let b being (Element of W);
let x being (Element of W);
reconsider y = x,a1 = a,b1 = b as (Element of V) by A1;
( ( a * b ) * x ) = ( ( a1 * b1 ) * y ) by A1;
then ( ( a * b ) * x ) = ( a1 * ( b1 * y ) ) by GROUP_1:def 3;
hence ( ( a * b ) * x ) = ( a * ( b * x ) ) by A1;
end;
A7: (for v,w being (Element of W) holds ( v * w ) = ( w * v ))
proof
let v being (Element of W);
let w being (Element of W);
reconsider v1 = v,w1 = w as (Element of V) by A1;
( v * w ) = ( v1 * w1 ) by A1;
then ( v * w ) = ( w1 * v1 );
hence ( v * w ) = ( w * v ) by A1;
end;
A8: (for x,y,z being (VECTOR of W) holds ( ( x + y ) + z ) = ( x + ( y + z ) ))
proof
let x being (VECTOR of W);
let y being (VECTOR of W);
let z being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y,z1 = z as (VECTOR of V) by A1;
( ( x + y ) + z ) = ( ( x1 + y1 ) + z1 ) by A1;
then ( ( x + y ) + z ) = ( x1 + ( y1 + z1 ) ) by RLVECT_1:def 3;
hence ( ( x + y ) + z ) = ( x + ( y + z ) ) by A1;
end;
A9: (for x,y being (VECTOR of W) holds ( x + y ) = ( y + x ))
proof
let x being (VECTOR of W);
let y being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y as (VECTOR of V) by A1;
( x + y ) = ( x1 + y1 ) by A1;
then ( x + y ) = ( y1 + x1 );
hence ( x + y ) = ( y + x ) by A1;
end;
A10: W is  vector-distributive
proof
let a being Complex;
let x being (VECTOR of W);
let y being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y as (Element of V) by A1;
( a * ( x + y ) ) = ( a * ( x1 + y1 ) ) by A1;
then ( a * ( x + y ) ) = ( ( a * x1 ) + ( a * y1 ) ) by CLVECT_1:def 2;
hence ( a * ( x + y ) ) = ( ( a * x ) + ( a * y ) ) by A1;
end;
A11: W is  scalar-distributive
proof
let a being Complex;
let b being Complex;
let x being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider x1 = x as (Element of V) by A1;
( ( a + b ) * x ) = ( ( a + b ) * x1 ) by A1;
then ( ( a + b ) * x ) = ( ( a * x1 ) + ( b * x1 ) ) by CLVECT_1:def 3;
hence ( ( a + b ) * x ) = ( ( a * x ) + ( b * x ) ) by A1;
end;
A12: W is  scalar-associative
proof
let a being Complex;
let b being Complex;
let x being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider x1 = x as (Element of V) by A1;
( ( a * b ) * x ) = ( ( a * b ) * x1 ) by A1;
then ( ( a * b ) * x ) = ( a * ( b * x1 ) ) by CLVECT_1:def 4;
hence ( ( a * b ) * x ) = ( a * ( b * x ) ) by A1;
end;
A13: W is  vector-associative
proof
let x being (VECTOR of W);
let y being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider x1 = x,y1 = y as (Element of V) by A1;
let a being Complex;
( a * ( x * y ) ) = ( a * ( x1 * y1 ) ) by A1;
then ( a * ( x * y ) ) = ( ( a * x1 ) * y1 ) by CFUNCDOM:def 9;
hence ( a * ( x * y ) ) = ( ( a * x ) * y ) by A1;
end;
(for x being (VECTOR of W) holds ( x + ( 0. W ) ) = x)
proof
let x being (VECTOR of W);
reconsider y = x,z = ( 0. W ) as (VECTOR of V) by A1;
( x + ( 0. W ) ) = ( y + ( 0. V ) ) by A1;
hence ( x + ( 0. W ) ) = x by RLVECT_1:4;
