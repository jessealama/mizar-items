theorem
(for X being set holds (for Y,Z being  finite (Subset-Family of X) holds ((Z is  in_general_position & Y c= Z) implies Y is  in_general_position)))
proof
let X being set;
let Y being  finite (Subset-Family of X);
let Z being  finite (Subset-Family of X);
assume that
A1: Z is  in_general_position
and
A2: Y c= Z;
A3: (not ( {} ) in ( Components Z )) by A1,CKB28:def 1;
(not ( {} ) in ( Components Y ))
proof
deffunc T(set) = ( TRUE );
consider p being (FinSequence of ( bool X )) such that A4: ( len p ) = ( card Y ) and A5: ( rng p ) = Y and A6: ( Components Y ) = { ( Intersect ( rng ( MergeSequence (p,q) ) ) ) where q is (FinSequence of ( BOOLEAN )): ( len q ) = ( len p ) } by CKB22:def 1;
A7: p is  one-to-one by A4,A5,FINSEQ_4:62;
then A8: ( rng p ) = ( dom ( p " ) ) by FUNCT_1:33;
consider p1 being (FinSequence of ( bool X )) such that A9: ( len p1 ) = ( card Z ) and A10: ( rng p1 ) = Z and A11: ( Components Z ) = { ( Intersect ( rng ( MergeSequence (p1,q) ) ) ) where q is (FinSequence of ( BOOLEAN )): ( len q ) = ( len p1 ) } by CKB22:def 1;
defpred C[ set ]
 means
( p1 . $1 ) in ( rng p );
assume ( {} ) in ( Components Y );
then consider q being (FinSequence of ( BOOLEAN )) such that A12: ( {} ) = ( Intersect ( rng ( MergeSequence (p,q) ) ) ) and A13: ( len q ) = ( len p ) by A6;
deffunc F(set) = ( ( ( q * ( p " ) ) * p1 ) . $1 );
A14: ( dom p ) = ( rng ( p " ) ) by A7,FUNCT_1:33;
A15: (for i being Nat holds (i in ( Seg ( len p1 ) ) implies ((C[ i ] implies F(i) in ( BOOLEAN )) & ((not C[ i ]) implies T(i) in ( BOOLEAN )))))
proof
let i being Nat;
assume i in ( Seg ( len p1 ) );
then A16: i in ( dom p1 ) by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
thus (( p1 . i ) in ( rng p ) implies ( ( ( q * ( p " ) ) * p1 ) . i ) in ( BOOLEAN ))
proof
assume A17: ( p1 . i ) in ( rng p );
( rng ( p " ) ) = ( dom q ) by A13,A14,FINSEQ_3:29;
then ( p1 . i ) in ( dom ( q * ( p " ) ) ) by A8,A17,RELAT_1:27;
then A18: ( ( q * ( p " ) ) . ( p1 . i ) ) in ( rng ( q * ( p " ) ) ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
( rng ( ( q * ( p " ) ) * p1 ) ) = ( rng ( q * ( ( p " ) * p1 ) ) ) by RELAT_1:36;
then ( rng ( ( q * ( p " ) ) * p1 ) ) c= ( rng q ) by RELAT_1:26;
then A19: ( rng ( ( q * ( p " ) ) * p1 ) ) c= ( BOOLEAN ) by XBOOLE_1:1;
( dom ( q * ( p " ) ) ) c= ( rng p ) by A8,RELAT_1:25;
then ( rng ( q * ( p " ) ) ) = ( rng ( ( q * ( p " ) ) * p1 ) ) by A2,A5,A10,RELAT_1:28,XBOOLE_1:1;
then ( ( ( q * ( p " ) ) * p1 ) . i ) in ( rng ( ( q * ( p " ) ) * p1 ) ) by A16,A18,FUNCT_1:13;
hence thesis by A19;
end;

thus thesis;

then A23: ( rng p1 ) = ( dom ( p1 " ) ) by FUNCT_1:33;
( rng ( MergeSequence (p,q) ) ) c= ( rng ( MergeSequence (p1,q1) ) )
proof
let z being set;
assume z in ( rng ( MergeSequence (p,q) ) );

A33:now
per cases ;
suppose A34: ( q . i ) = ( TRUE );

hence z = ( p . i ) by A25,CKB10:1

suppose (not ( q . i ) = ( TRUE ));

then A35: ( q . i ) = ( FALSE ) by XBOOLEAN:def 3;

then ( {} ) = ( Intersect ( rng ( MergeSequence (p1,q1) ) ) ) by A12,SETFAM_1:44,XBOOLE_1:3;
hence contradiction by A3,A11,A20;
