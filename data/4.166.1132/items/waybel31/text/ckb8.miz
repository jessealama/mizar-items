theorem
Th6: (for T being non empty TopSpace holds (for L1 being  continuous sup-Semilattice holds (( InclPoset (the topology of T) ) = L1 implies (for B1 being  with_bottom (CLbasis of L1) holds B1 is (Basis of T)))))
proof
let T being non empty TopSpace;
let L1 being  continuous sup-Semilattice;
assume A1: ( InclPoset (the topology of T) ) = L1;
let B1 being  with_bottom (CLbasis of L1);
B1 c= (the carrier of L1);
then B1 c= (the topology of T) by A1,YELLOW_1:1;
then reconsider B2 = B1 as (Subset-Family of T) by XBOOLE_1:1;
A2: (for A being (Subset of T) holds (A is  open implies (for p being (Point of T) holds (p in A implies (ex a being (Subset of T) st ((a in B2 & p in a) & a c= A))))))
proof
let A being (Subset of T);
assume A is  open;
then A in (the topology of T) by PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then reconsider A1 = A as (Element of L1) by A1,YELLOW_1:1;
let p being (Point of T);
assume A3: p in A;
A1 = ( sup ( ( waybelow A1 ) /\ B1 ) ) by WAYBEL23:def 7
.= ( union ( ( waybelow A1 ) /\ B1 ) ) by A1,YELLOW_1:22;
then consider a being set such that A4: p in a and A5: a in ( ( waybelow A1 ) /\ B1 ) by A3,TARSKI:def 4;
a in (the carrier of L1) by A5;
then a in (the topology of T) by A1,YELLOW_1:1;
then reconsider a as (Subset of T);
take a;
thus a in B2 by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
thus p in a by A4;
reconsider a1 = a as (Element of L1) by A5;
a1 in ( waybelow A1 ) by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then a1 << A1 by WAYBEL_3:7;
then a1 <= A1 by WAYBEL_3:1;
hence thesis by A1,YELLOW_1:3;
end;
B2 c= (the topology of T)
proof
let x being set;
assume x in B2;
then reconsider x1 = x as (Element of L1);
x1 in (the carrier of L1);
hence thesis by A1,YELLOW_1:1;
end;
hence thesis by A2,YELLOW_9:32;
