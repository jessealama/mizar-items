theorem
Th7: (for T being non  empty TopSpace holds (for L1 being  continuous  lower-bounded LATTICE holds (( InclPoset (the topology of T) ) = L1 implies (for B1 being (Basis of T) holds (for B2 being (Subset of L1) holds (B1 = B2 implies ( finsups B2 ) is  with_bottom  with_bottom (CLbasis of L1)))))))
proof
let T being non  empty TopSpace;
let L1 being  continuous  lower-bounded LATTICE;
assume A1: ( InclPoset (the topology of T) ) = L1;
let B1 being (Basis of T);
let B2 being (Subset of L1);
assume A2: B1 = B2;
A3: (for x,y being (Element of L1) holds ((not y <= x) implies (ex b being (Element of L1) st ((b in ( finsups B2 ) & (not b <= x)) & b <= y))))
proof
let x being (Element of L1);
let y being (Element of L1);
y in (the carrier of L1);
then A4: y in (the topology of T) by A1,YELLOW_1:1;
then reconsider y1 = y as (Subset of T);
assume (not y <= x);
then (not y c= x) by A1,YELLOW_1:3;
then consider v being set such that A5: v in y and A6: (not v in x) by TARSKI:def 3;
v in y1 by A5;
then reconsider v as (Point of T);
y1 is  open by A4,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
then consider b being (Subset of T) such that A7: b in B1 and A8: v in b and A9: b c= y1 by A5,YELLOW_9:31;
reconsider b as (Element of L1) by A2,A7;
(for z being set holds (z in { b } implies z in B2)) by A2,A7,TARSKI:def 1;
then A10: { b } is  finite  finite (Subset of B2) by TARSKI:def 3;
take b;
( ex_sup_of { b },L1 & b = ( "\/" ({ b },L1) )) by YELLOW_0:38,YELLOW_0:39;
then b in { ( "\/" (Y,L1) ) where Y is  finite (Subset of B2):  ex_sup_of Y,L1 } by A10;
hence b in ( finsups B2 ) by WAYBEL_0:def 27;
(not b c= x) by A6,A8;
hence (not b <= x) by A1,YELLOW_1:3;
thus thesis by A1,A9,YELLOW_1:3;
end;
now
let x being (Element of L1);
let y being (Element of L1);
assume that
A11: x in ( finsups B2 )
and
A12: y in ( finsups B2 );
y in { ( "\/" (Y,L1) ) where Y is  finite (Subset of B2):  ex_sup_of Y,L1 } by A12,WAYBEL_0:def 27;
then consider Y2 being  finite (Subset of B2) such that A13: y = ( "\/" (Y2,L1) ) and A14:  ex_sup_of Y2,L1;
x in { ( "\/" (Y,L1) ) where Y is  finite (Subset of B2):  ex_sup_of Y,L1 } by A11,WAYBEL_0:def 27;
then consider Y1 being  finite (Subset of B2) such that A15: x = ( "\/" (Y1,L1) ) and A16:  ex_sup_of Y1,L1;
( ex_sup_of ( Y1 \/ Y2 ),L1 & ( "\/" (( Y1 \/ Y2 ),L1) ) = ( ( "\/" (Y1,L1) ) "\/" ( "\/" (Y2,L1) ) )) by A16,A14,YELLOW_2:3;
then ( x "\/" y ) in { ( "\/" (Y,L1) ) where Y is  finite (Subset of B2):  ex_sup_of Y,L1 } by A15,A13;
then ( x "\/" y ) in ( finsups B2 ) by WAYBEL_0:def 27;
hence ( sup { x,y } ) in ( finsups B2 ) by YELLOW_0:41;
end;
then A17: ( finsups B2 ) is  join-closed by WAYBEL23:18;
(( {} ) c= B2 &  ex_sup_of ( {} ),L1) by XBOOLE_1:2,YELLOW_0:42;
then ( "\/" (( {} ),L1) ) in { ( "\/" (Y,L1) ) where Y is  finite (Subset of B2):  ex_sup_of Y,L1 };
then ( Bottom L1 ) in ( finsups B2 ) by WAYBEL_0:def 27;
hence thesis by A17,A3,WAYBEL23:49,WAYBEL23:def 8;
end;
