theorem
Th25: (for T being  Lawson  complete TopLattice holds (for X being  finite (Subset of T) holds (( ( uparrow X ) ` ) is  open & ( ( downarrow X ) ` ) is  open)))
proof
let T being  Lawson  complete TopLattice;
let X being  finite (Subset of T);
deffunc F((Element of T)) = ( uparrow $1 );
{ ( uparrow x ) where x is (Element of T): x in X } c= ( bool (the carrier of T) )
proof
let z being set;
assume z in { ( uparrow x ) where x is (Element of T): x in X };
then (ex x being (Element of T) st (z = ( uparrow x ) & x in X));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider upx = { ( uparrow x ) where x is (Element of T): x in X } as (Subset-Family of T);
{ ( downarrow x ) where x is (Element of T): x in X } c= ( bool (the carrier of T) )
proof
let z being set;
assume z in { ( downarrow x ) where x is (Element of T): x in X };
then (ex x being (Element of T) st (z = ( downarrow x ) & x in X));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider dox = { ( downarrow x ) where x is (Element of T): x in X } as (Subset-Family of T);
reconsider dox as (Subset-Family of T);
reconsider upx as (Subset-Family of T);
A1: ( uparrow X ) = ( union upx ) by YELLOW_9:4;
now
let P being (Subset of T);
assume P in upx;
then (ex x being (Element of T) st (P = ( uparrow x ) & x in X));
hence P is  closed by WAYBEL19:38;
end;
then A2: upx is  closed by TOPS_2:def 2;
A3: X is  finite;
{ F(x) where x is (Element of T): x in X } is  finite from FRAENKEL:sch 21(A3);
then ( uparrow X ) is  closed by A2,A1,TOPS_2:21;
hence ( ( uparrow X ) ` ) is  open by TOPS_1:3;
deffunc F((Element of T)) = ( downarrow $1 );
A4: ( downarrow X ) = ( union dox ) by YELLOW_9:4;
now
let P being (Subset of T);
assume P in dox;
then (ex x being (Element of T) st (P = ( downarrow x ) & x in X));
hence P is  closed by WAYBEL19:38;
end;
then A5: dox is  closed by TOPS_2:def 2;
{ F(x) where x is (Element of T): x in X } is  finite from FRAENKEL:sch 21(A3);
then ( downarrow X ) is  closed by A5,A4,TOPS_2:21;
