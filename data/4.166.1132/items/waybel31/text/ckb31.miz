theorem
Th27: (for L1 being  continuous  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice holds (for T being  Scott (TopAugmentation of L1) holds (for b being (Basis of T) holds { ( wayabove ( inf u ) ) where u is (Subset of T): u in b } is (Basis of T))))
proof
let L1 being  continuous  lower-bounded sup-Semilattice;
let T being  Scott (TopAugmentation of L1);
let b being (Basis of T);
set b2 = { ( wayabove ( inf u ) ) where u is (Subset of T): u in b };
b2 c= ( bool (the carrier of T) )
proof
let z being set;
assume z in b2;
then (ex u being (Subset of T) st (z = ( wayabove ( inf u ) ) & u in b));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider b2 as (Subset-Family of T);
reconsider b1 = { ( wayabove x ) where x is (Element of T): (not contradiction) } as (Basis of T) by WAYBEL11:45;
A1:now
let A being (Subset of T);
assume A2: A is  open;
let a being (Point of T);
assume a in A;
then consider C being (Subset of T) such that A3: C in b1 and A4: a in C and A5: C c= A by A2,YELLOW_9:31;
C is  open by A3,YELLOW_8:10;
then consider D being (Subset of T) such that A6: D in b and A7: a in D and A8: D c= C by A4,YELLOW_9:31;
D is  open by A6,YELLOW_8:10;
then consider E being (Subset of T) such that A9: E in b1 and A10: a in E and A11: E c= D by A7,YELLOW_9:31;
consider z being (Element of T) such that A12: E = ( wayabove z ) by A9;
take u = ( wayabove ( inf D ) );
thus u in b2 by A6;
reconsider a1 = a as (Element of T);
consider x being (Element of T) such that A13: C = ( wayabove x ) by A3;
z << a1 by A10,A12,WAYBEL_3:8;
then consider y being (Element of T) such that A14: z << y and A15: y << a1 by WAYBEL_4:52;
(( inf D ) is_<=_than D & y in ( wayabove z )) by A14,WAYBEL_3:8,YELLOW_0:33;
then ( inf D ) <= y by A11,A12,LATTICE3:def 8;
then ( inf D ) << a1 by A15,WAYBEL_3:2;
hence a in u by WAYBEL_3:8;
A16: ( wayabove x ) c= ( uparrow x ) by WAYBEL_3:11;
( ex_inf_of ( uparrow x ),T &  ex_inf_of D,T) by YELLOW_0:17;
then ( inf ( uparrow x ) ) <= ( inf D ) by A13,A8,A16,XBOOLE_1:1,YELLOW_0:35;
then x <= ( inf D ) by WAYBEL_0:39;
then ( wayabove ( inf D ) ) c= C by A13,WAYBEL_3:12;
hence u c= A by A5,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;
b2 c= (the topology of T)
proof
let z being set;
assume z in b2;
then consider u being (Subset of T) such that A17: z = ( wayabove ( inf u ) ) and u in b;
( wayabove ( inf u ) ) is  open by WAYBEL11:36;
hence thesis by A17,PRE_TOPC:def 2;
end;
hence thesis by A1,YELLOW_9:32;
