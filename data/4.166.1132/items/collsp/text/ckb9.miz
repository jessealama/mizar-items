let a being (Point of CLS),b being (Point of CLS),c being (Point of CLS),p being (Point of CLS),q being (Point of CLS),r being (Point of CLS);
A1: (for z1,z2,z3 being (Point of CLS) holds [ z1,z2,z3 ] in (the Collinearity of CLS))
proof
let z1 being (Point of CLS),z2 being (Point of CLS),z3 being (Point of CLS);
A2: z3 = 1 by TARSKI:def 1;
(z1 = 1 & z2 = 1) by TARSKI:def 1;
hence thesis by A2,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
hence (((a = b or a = c) or b = c) implies [ a,b,c ] in (the Collinearity of CLS));
thus ((((a <> b & [ a,b,p ] in (the Collinearity of CLS)) & [ a,b,q ] in (the Collinearity of CLS)) & [ a,b,r ] in (the Collinearity of CLS)) implies [ p,q,r ] in (the Collinearity of CLS)) by A1;
