proof
(for a,b,c being (Point of CLS) holds ([ a,b,c ] in RR iff (((((a = b or b = c) or c = a) & a in Z) & b in Z) & c in Z)))
proof
let a being (Point of CLS),b being (Point of CLS),c being (Point of CLS);
thus ([ a,b,c ] in RR implies (((((a = b or b = c) or c = a) & a in Z) & b in Z) & c in Z))
proof
assume [ a,b,c ] in RR;
then consider i,j,k such that A1: [ a,b,c ] = [ i,j,k ] and A2: ((i = j or j = k) or k = i) and i in Z and j in Z and k in Z;
