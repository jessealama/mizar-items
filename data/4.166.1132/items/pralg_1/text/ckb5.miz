theorem
Th2: (U1,U2 are_similar  implies UAStr (# [: (the carrier of U1),(the carrier of U2) :],( Opers (U1,U2) ) #) is  strict  strict Universal_Algebra)
proof
set C = UAStr (# [: (the carrier of U1),(the carrier of U2) :],( Opers (U1,U2) ) #);
A1: ( dom ( Opers (U1,U2) ) ) = ( Seg ( len ( Opers (U1,U2) ) ) ) by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
assume A2: U1,U2 are_similar ;
then A3: (( dom (the charact of U2) ) = ( Seg ( len (the charact of U2) ) ) & ( len (the charact of U2) ) = ( len (the charact of U1) )) by FINSEQ_1:def 3,UNIALG_2:1;

A6: (the charact of C) is  quasi_total
proof

proof

A11: (the charact of C) is  homogeneous
proof
let n;
