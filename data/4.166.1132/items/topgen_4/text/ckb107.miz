theorem
Th67: (for X being (Subset-Family of T) holds (ex Y being  all-open-containing  compl-closed  closed_for_countable_unions (Subset-Family of T) st (X c= Y & (for Z being  all-open-containing  compl-closed  closed_for_countable_unions (Subset-Family of T) holds (X c= Z implies Y c= Z)))))
proof
let X being (Subset-Family of T);
set V = { S where S is (Subset-Family of T): (X c= S & S is  all-open-containing  compl-closed  closed_for_countable_unions  all-open-containing  compl-closed  closed_for_countable_unions (Subset-Family of T)) };

hence ( {} ) in Z by PROB_1:4;

then ( {} ) in Y by A2,SETFAM_1:def 1;
then reconsider Y as (SigmaField of T) by A2,A5,A3,PROB_1:15,SETFAM_1:3;
(for A being (Subset of T) holds (A is  open implies A in Y))
proof
let A being (Subset of T);
