theorem
Th14: (for L being  continuous  complete non empty Poset holds (for f being (Function of ( FixedUltraFilters X ),(the carrier of L)) holds ( ( f -extension_to_hom ) | ( FixedUltraFilters X ) ) = f))
proof
let L being  continuous  complete non empty Poset;
let f being (Function of ( FixedUltraFilters X ),(the carrier of L));
set FUF = ( FixedUltraFilters X );
set BP = ( BoolePoset X );
set IP = ( InclPoset ( Filt BP ) );

set F = ( f -extension_to_hom );
A2: (the carrier of BP) = (the carrier of ( LattPOSet ( BooleLatt X ) )) by YELLOW_1:def 2
.= ( bool X ) by LATTICE3:def 1;
now
A3: ( dom F ) = (the carrier of IP) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence FUF = ( dom ( F | FUF ) ) by A1,CKB15:1,RELAT_1:62;
thus FUF = ( dom f ) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
let xf being set;
assume A4: xf in FUF;

A5: ( ( F | FUF ) . xf ) = ( F . xf ) by A4,FUNCT_1:49;
FUF c= ( dom F ) by A1,A3,CKB15:1;

reconsider xf9 = xf as (Element of FUF9) by A4;
set Xs = { ( "/\" ({ ( f . ( uparrow x ) ): (ex z st (x = { z } & z in Y)) },L) ) where Y is (Subset of X): Y in x9 };
reconsider f9 = f as (Function of FUF9,(the carrier of L));
( f9 . xf9 ) is (Element of L);

consider xx being (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) such that A6: xf = ( uparrow xx ) and A7: (ex y being (Element of X) st xx = { y }) by A4;
A8: Xs is_<=_than fxf
proof
let b being (Element of L);
assume b in Xs;
then consider Y being (Subset of X) such that A9: b = ( "/\" ({ ( f . ( uparrow x ) ): (ex z st (x = { z } & z in Y)) },L) ) and A10: Y in x9;
set Xsi = { ( f . ( uparrow x ) ): (ex z st (x = { z } & z in Y)) };
 ex_inf_of Xsi,L by YELLOW_0:17;

consider y being (Element of X) such that A12: xx = { y } by A7;
xx <= Y by A6,A10,WAYBEL_0:18;
then xx c= Y by YELLOW_1:2;
then y in Y by A12,ZFMISC_1:31;
then fxf in Xsi by A6,A12;
hence b <= fxf by A11,LATTICE3:def 8;
end;
A13: (for a being (Element of L) holds (Xs is_<=_than a implies fxf <= a))
proof
xx <= xx;
then reconsider Y = xx as (Element of x9) by A6,WAYBEL_0:18;
set Xsi = { ( f . ( uparrow x ) ): (ex z st (x = { z } & z in Y)) };
consider y being (Element of X) such that A14: xx = { y } by A7;
now
let p being set;
hereby
assume p in Xsi;
then consider r being (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) such that A15: p = ( f . ( uparrow r ) ) and A16: (ex z being (Element of X) st (r = { z } & z in Y));
xx = r by A14,A16,TARSKI:def 1;
hence p in { fxf } by A6,A15,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
assume p in { fxf };
then A17: p = fxf by TARSKI:def 1;
y in Y by A14,TARSKI:def 1;
hence p in Xsi by A6,A14,A17;
end;
then Xsi = { fxf } by TARSKI:1;
then fxf = ( "/\" (Xsi,L) ) by YELLOW_0:39;
then A18: fxf in Xs by A2;
let a being (Element of L);
assume Xs is_<=_than a;
hence thesis by A18,LATTICE3:def 9;
end;
 ex_sup_of Xs,L by YELLOW_0:17;
then ( f . xf ) = ( "\/" (Xs,L) ) by A8,A13,YELLOW_0:def 9;
hence ( ( F | FUF ) . xf ) = ( f . xf ) by A5,CKB18:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by FUNCT_1:2;
