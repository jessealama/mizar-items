theorem
Th10: ( card ( FixedUltraFilters X ) ) = ( card X )
proof
set FUF = { ( uparrow x ): (ex z st x = { z }) };
A1: ( BoolePoset X ) = ( InclPoset ( bool X ) ) by YELLOW_1:4;
A2: ( InclPoset ( bool X ) ) = RelStr (# ( bool X ),( RelIncl ( bool X ) ) #) by YELLOW_1:def 1;
then A3: (the carrier of ( BoolePoset X )) = ( bool X ) by YELLOW_1:4;
X,FUF are_equipotent 
proof
defpred P[ set,set ]
 means
(ex y being (Element of X) st (ex x being (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) st ((x = { y } & $1 = y) & $2 = ( uparrow x ))));
A4: (for x being set holds (x in X implies (ex y being set st P[ x,y ])))
proof
let x being set;
assume A5: x in X;
then reconsider x9 = x as (Element of X);
reconsider bx = { x } as (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) by A1,A2,A5,ZFMISC_1:31;
take ( uparrow bx );
take x9;
take bx;
thus thesis;
end;
consider f being Function such that A6: (( dom f ) = X & (for x being set holds (x in X implies P[ x,( f . x ) ]))) from CLASSES1:sch 1(A4);
take f;
thus f is  one-to-one
proof
let x1 being set,x2 being set;
assume that
A7: x1 in ( dom f )
and
A8: x2 in ( dom f )
and
A9: ( f . x1 ) = ( f . x2 );
consider x29 being (Element of X),bx2 being (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) such that A10: (bx2 = { x29 } & x2 = x29) and A11: ( f . x2 ) = ( uparrow bx2 ) by A6,A8;
consider x19 being (Element of X),bx1 being (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) such that A12: (bx1 = { x19 } & x1 = x19) and A13: ( f . x1 ) = ( uparrow bx1 ) by A6,A7;
bx1 = bx2 by A9,A13,A11,WAYBEL_0:20;
hence thesis by A12,A10,ZFMISC_1:3;
end;

thus ( dom f ) = X by A6;
now
let z being set;
hereby
assume z in ( rng f );
then consider x1 being set such that A14: x1 in ( dom f ) and A15: z = ( f . x1 ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
(ex x19 being (Element of X) st (ex bx1 being (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) st ((bx1 = { x19 } & x1 = x19) & ( f . x1 ) = ( uparrow bx1 )))) by A6,A14;
hence z in FUF by A15;
end;
assume z in FUF;
then consider bx being (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) such that A16: z = ( uparrow bx ) and A17: (ex y being (Element of X) st bx = { y });
consider y being (Element of X) such that A18: bx = { y } by A17;
A19: y in X by A3,A18,ZFMISC_1:31;
then (ex x19 being (Element of X) st (ex bx1 being (Element of ( BoolePoset X )) st ((bx1 = { x19 } & y = x19) & ( f . y ) = ( uparrow bx1 )))) by A6;
hence z in ( rng f ) by A6,A16,A18,A19,FUNCT_1:def 3;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
end;
hence thesis by CARD_1:5;
