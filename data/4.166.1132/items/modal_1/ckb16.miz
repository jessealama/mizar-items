theorem
Th17: (for Z1,Z2 being Tree holds (for p being (FinSequence of ( NAT )) holds (p in Z1 implies (for v being (Element of ( Z1 with-replacement (p,Z2) )) holds (for w being (Element of Z1) holds ((v = w & w is_a_proper_prefix_of p) implies ( succ v ) = ( succ w )))))))
proof
let Z1 being Tree,Z2 being Tree;
let p being (FinSequence of ( NAT ));
assume A1: p in Z1;
set Z = ( Z1 with-replacement (p,Z2) );
let v being (Element of Z);
let w being (Element of Z1);
assume that
A2: v = w
and
A3: w is_a_proper_prefix_of p;
w is_a_prefix_of p by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 8;
then consider r being FinSequence such that A4: p = ( w ^ r ) by TREES_1:1;
now
let n being Nat;
assume A5: n in ( dom r );
then ( ( len w ) + n ) in ( dom p ) by A4,FINSEQ_1:28;
then A6: ( p . ( ( len w ) + n ) ) in ( rng p ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
( p . ( ( len w ) + n ) ) = ( r . n ) by A4,A5,FINSEQ_1:def 7;
hence ( r . n ) in ( NAT ) by A6;
end;
then reconsider r as (FinSequence of ( NAT )) by FINSEQ_2:12;
A7: r <> ( {} ) by A3,A4,FINSEQ_1:34;
now
let x;
thus (x in ( succ v ) implies x in ( succ w ))
proof
assume x in ( succ v );
then x in { ( v ^ <* n *> ): ( v ^ <* n *> ) in Z } by TREES_2:def 5;
then consider n such that A8: x = ( v ^ <* n *> ) and A9: ( v ^ <* n *> ) in Z;
reconsider x9 = x as (FinSequence of ( NAT )) by A8;
now
per cases  by A1,A8,A9,TREES_1:def 9;
suppose (x9 in Z1 & (not p is_a_proper_prefix_of x9));

then x in { ( w ^ <* m *> ): ( w ^ <* m *> ) in Z1 } by A2,A8;
hence thesis by TREES_2:def 5;
end;
suppose (ex r being (FinSequence of ( NAT )) st (r in Z2 & x9 = ( p ^ r )));

then consider s such that s in Z2 and A10: ( v ^ <* n *> ) = ( p ^ s ) by A8;
( w ^ <* n *> ) = ( w ^ ( r ^ s ) ) by A2,A4,A10,FINSEQ_1:32;
then A11: <* n *> = ( r ^ s ) by FINSEQ_1:33;
s = ( {} )
proof
assume (not thesis);
then ( len s ) > ( 0 ) by NAT_1:3;
then A12: ( ( 0 ) + 1 ) <= ( len s ) by NAT_1:13;
( len r ) > ( 0 ) by A7,NAT_1:3;
then ( ( 0 ) + 1 ) <= ( len r ) by NAT_1:13;
then ( 1 + 1 ) <= ( ( len r ) + ( len s ) ) by A12,XREAL_1:7;
then 2 <= ( len <* n *> ) by A11,FINSEQ_1:22;
then 2 <= 1 by FINSEQ_1:39;
hence contradiction;
end;
then <* n *> = r by A11,FINSEQ_1:34;
then x in { ( w ^ <* m *> ): ( w ^ <* m *> ) in Z1 } by A1,A2,A4,A8;
hence thesis by TREES_2:def 5;
end;
end;
hence thesis;
end;

assume x in ( succ w );
then x in { ( w ^ <* n *> ): ( w ^ <* n *> ) in Z1 } by TREES_2:def 5;
then consider n such that A13: x = ( w ^ <* n *> ) and A14: ( w ^ <* n *> ) in Z1;
now
assume A15: (not ( v ^ <* n *> ) in Z);
now
per cases  by A1,A15,TREES_1:def 9;
suppose (not ( v ^ <* n *> ) in Z1);

hence contradiction by A2,A14;
end;
suppose p is_a_proper_prefix_of ( v ^ <* n *> );

then r is_a_proper_prefix_of <* n *> by A2,A4,TREES_1:49;
then r in ( ProperPrefixes <* n *> ) by TREES_1:12;
then r in { ( {} ) } by TREES_1:16;
hence contradiction by A7,TARSKI:def 1;
end;
end;
hence contradiction;
end;
then x in { ( v ^ <* m *> ): ( v ^ <* m *> ) in Z } by A2,A13;
hence x in ( succ v ) by TREES_2:def 5;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:1;
end;
