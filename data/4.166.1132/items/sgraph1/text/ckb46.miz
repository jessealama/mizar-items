reserve X for set;
theorem
(for g being (SimpleGraph of X) holds (for v being set holds (for vg being  finite set holds (((vg = (the carrier of g) & v in vg) & ( 1 + ( degree (g,v) ) ) = ( card vg )) implies (for w being (Element of vg) holds (v <> w implies (ex e being set st (e in (the SEdges of g) & e = { v,w }))))))))
proof
let g being (SimpleGraph of X);
let v being set;
let vg being  finite set;
assume that
A1: vg = (the carrier of g)
and
A2: v in vg
and
A3: ( 1 + ( degree (g,v) ) ) = ( card vg );
vg is (Subset of X) by A1,CKB31:1;
then reconsider X as non  empty set by A2;
let w being (Element of vg);
assume A4: v <> w;
take { v,w };
hereby
now
consider ww being  finite set such that A5: ww = { vv where vv is (Element of X): (vv in vg & { v,vv } in (the SEdges of g)) } and A6: ( degree (g,v) ) = ( card ww ) by A1,CKB43:1;
reconsider wwv = ( ww \/ { v } ) as  finite set;
assume A7: (not { v,w } in (the SEdges of g));
A8: ((not v in ww) & (not w in ww))
proof
hereby
assume v in ww;
then (ex vv being (Element of X) st ((v = vv & vv in vg) & { v,vv } in (the SEdges of g))) by A5;
then { v } in (the SEdges of g) by ENUMSET1:29;
then (ex z being  finite (Subset of vg) st ({ v } = z & ( card z ) = 2)) by A1,CKB13:1;
hence contradiction by CARD_1:30;
end;
assume w in ww;
then (ex vv being (Element of X) st ((w = vv & vv in vg) & { v,vv } in (the SEdges of g))) by A5;
hence contradiction by A7;
end;
A9:now
let e being set;
assume e in ww;
then (ex vv being (Element of X) st ((e = vv & vv in vg) & { v,vv } in (the SEdges of g))) by A5;
hence e in vg;
end;
(wwv c= vg & wwv <> vg)
proof
(for e being set holds (e in { v } implies e in vg)) by A2,TARSKI:def 1;
then A10: { v } c= vg by TARSKI:def 3;
ww c= vg by A9,TARSKI:def 3;
hence wwv c= vg by A10,XBOOLE_1:8;
assume A11: wwv = vg;
(not w in { v }) by A4,TARSKI:def 1;
hence contradiction by A8,A11,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
then A12: wwv c< vg by XBOOLE_0:def 8;
( card wwv ) = ( 1 + ( card ww ) ) by A8,CARD_2:41;
hence contradiction by A3,A6,A12,CARD_2:48;
end;
hence { v,w } in (the SEdges of g);
end;
thus thesis;
end;
