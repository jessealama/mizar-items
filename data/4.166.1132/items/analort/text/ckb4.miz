theorem
Lm4: ( Gen x,y implies (x <> ( 0. V ) & y <> ( 0. V )))
proof
assume A1:  Gen x,y;
A2: x <> ( 0. V )
proof
assume A3: x = ( 0. V );
consider a,b such that A4: a = 1 and A5: b = ( 0 );
( ( a * x ) + ( b * y ) ) = ( ( 0. V ) + ( ( 0 ) * y ) ) by A3,A5,RLVECT_1:10
.= ( ( 0. V ) + ( 0. V ) ) by RLVECT_1:10
.= ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:4;
hence contradiction by A1,A4,ANALMETR:def 1;
end;
y <> ( 0. V )
proof
assume A6: y = ( 0. V );
consider a,b such that A7: a = ( 0 ) and A8: b = 1;
( ( a * x ) + ( b * y ) ) = ( ( 0. V ) + ( 1 * ( 0. V ) ) ) by A6,A7,A8,RLVECT_1:10
.= ( ( 0. V ) + ( 0. V ) ) by RLVECT_1:10
.= ( 0. V ) by RLVECT_1:4;
hence thesis by A1,A8,ANALMETR:def 1;
end;
hence thesis by A2;
