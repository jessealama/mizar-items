theorem
Th18: (for L being non  empty RelStr holds (for N being (prenet of L) holds (N is  eventually-directed implies ( rng ( netmap (N,L) ) ) is  directed)))
proof
let L being non  empty RelStr;
let N being (prenet of L);
assume that
A1: N is  eventually-directed;
set f = ( netmap (N,L) );
let x being (Element of L);
let y being (Element of L);
assume that
A2: x in ( rng f )
and
A3: y in ( rng f );
consider a being set such that A4: a in ( dom f ) and A5: ( f . a ) = x by A2,FUNCT_1:def 3;
consider b being set such that A6: b in ( dom f ) and A7: ( f . b ) = y by A3,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider a,b as (Element of N) by A4,A6;
consider ja being (Element of N) such that A8: (for k being (Element of N) holds (ja <= k implies ( N . a ) <= ( N . k ))) by A1,WAYBEL_0:11;
consider jb being (Element of N) such that A9: (for k being (Element of N) holds (jb <= k implies ( N . b ) <= ( N . k ))) by A1,WAYBEL_0:11;
( [#] N ) is  directed by WAYBEL_0:def 6;
then consider c being (Element of N) such that c in ( [#] N ) and A10: (ja <= c & jb <= c) by WAYBEL_0:def 1;
take z = ( f . c );
( dom f ) = (the carrier of N) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
hence z in ( rng f ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
( N . c ) = ( f . c );
hence thesis by A5,A7,A8,A9,A10;
end;
