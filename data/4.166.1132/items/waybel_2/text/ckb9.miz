theorem
Th6: (for L being Semilattice holds (for D being non empty  directed (Subset of [: L,L :]) holds ( union { X where X is non empty  directed (Subset of L): (ex x being (Element of L) st (X = ( { x } "/\" ( proj2 D ) ) & x in ( proj1 D ))) } ) = ( ( proj1 D ) "/\" ( proj2 D ) )))
proof
let L being Semilattice;
let D being non empty  directed (Subset of [: L,L :]);
set D1 = ( proj1 D );
set D2 = ( proj2 D );
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex x being (Element of L) st ($1 = ( { x } "/\" ( proj2 D ) ) & x in ( proj1 D )));
reconsider T = D2 as non empty  directed (Subset of L) by YELLOW_3:21,YELLOW_3:22;
A1: ( D1 "/\" D2 ) = { ( x "/\" y ) where x is (Element of L),y is (Element of L): (x in D1 & y in D2) } by YELLOW_4:def 4;
thus ( union { X where X is non empty  directed (Subset of L): P[ X ] } ) c= ( D1 "/\" D2 )
proof
let q being set;
assume q in ( union { X where X is non empty  directed (Subset of L): P[ X ] } );
then consider w being set such that A2: q in w and A3: w in { X where X is non empty  directed (Subset of L): P[ X ] } by TARSKI:def 4;
consider e being non empty  directed (Subset of L) such that A4: w = e and A5: P[ e ] by A3;
consider p being (Element of L) such that A6: e = ( { p } "/\" D2 ) and A7: p in D1 by A5;
( { p } "/\" D2 ) = { ( p "/\" y ) where y is (Element of L): y in D2 } by YELLOW_4:42;
then (ex y being (Element of L) st (q = ( p "/\" y ) & y in D2)) by A2,A4,A6;
hence thesis by A1,A7;
end;

let q being set;
assume q in ( D1 "/\" D2 );
then consider x being (Element of L),y being (Element of L) such that A8: q = ( x "/\" y ) and A9: x in D1 and A10: y in D2 by A1;
reconsider xx = { x } as non empty  directed (Subset of L) by WAYBEL_0:5;
( xx "/\" T ) is non empty  directed;
then A11: ( { x } "/\" D2 ) in { X where X is non empty  directed (Subset of L): P[ X ] } by A9;
( { x } "/\" D2 ) = { ( x "/\" d ) where d is (Element of L): d in D2 } by YELLOW_4:42;
then q in ( { x } "/\" D2 ) by A8,A10;
hence thesis by A11,TARSKI:def 4;
