theorem
Th27: (for L being  with_infima  antisymmetric  transitive RelStr holds (for N being (prenet of L) holds (for x being (Element of L) holds (N is  eventually-directed implies ( x "/\" N ) is  eventually-directed))))
proof
let L being  with_infima  antisymmetric  transitive RelStr;
let N being (prenet of L);
let x being (Element of L);
assume that
A1: N is  eventually-directed;
A2: ( the RelStr of ( x "/\" N ) ) = ( the RelStr of N ) by CKB32:def 1;
(for i being (Element of ( x "/\" N )) holds (ex j being (Element of ( x "/\" N )) st (for k being (Element of ( x "/\" N )) holds (j <= k implies ( ( x "/\" N ) . i ) <= ( ( x "/\" N ) . k )))))
proof
let i1 being (Element of ( x "/\" N ));
reconsider i = i1 as (Element of N) by CKB33:1;
consider j being (Element of N) such that A3: (for k being (Element of N) holds (j <= k implies ( N . i ) <= ( N . k ))) by A1,WAYBEL_0:11;
reconsider j1 = j as (Element of ( x "/\" N )) by CKB33:1;
take j1;
let k1 being (Element of ( x "/\" N ));
reconsider k = k1 as (Element of N) by CKB33:1;
assume j1 <= k1;
then j <= k by A2,YELLOW_0:1;
then A4: ( N . i ) <= ( N . k ) by A3;
((ex yi being (Element of L) st (yi = ( (the mapping of N) . i1 ) & ( (the mapping of ( x "/\" N )) . i1 ) = ( x "/\" yi ))) & (ex yk being (Element of L) st (yk = ( (the mapping of N) . k1 ) & ( (the mapping of ( x "/\" N )) . k1 ) = ( x "/\" yk )))) by CKB32:def 1;
hence thesis by A4,WAYBEL_1:1;
end;
hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:11;
