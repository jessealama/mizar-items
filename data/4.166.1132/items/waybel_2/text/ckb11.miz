theorem
Th8: (for L being  up-complete Semilattice holds (for D being non  empty  directed (Subset of [: L,L :]) holds  ex_sup_of { ( sup X ) where X is non  empty  directed (Subset of L): (ex x being (Element of L) st (X = ( { x } "/\" ( proj2 D ) ) & x in ( proj1 D ))) },L))
proof
let L being  up-complete Semilattice;
let D being non  empty  directed (Subset of [: L,L :]);
reconsider D1 = ( proj1 D ),D2 = ( proj2 D ) as non  empty  directed (Subset of L) by YELLOW_3:21,YELLOW_3:22;

 means
(ex x being (Element of L) st ($1 = ( { x } "/\" D2 ) & x in D1));
set A = { ( sup X ) where X is non  empty  directed (Subset of L): P[ X ] };
A c= (the carrier of L)
proof
let q being set;
assume q in A;
then (ex X being non  empty  directed (Subset of L) st (q = ( sup X ) & P[ X ]));
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider A as (Subset of L);
set R = { X where X is non  empty  directed (Subset of L): P[ X ] };
( union R ) c= (the carrier of L)
proof
let q being set;
assume q in ( union R );
then consider r being set such that A1: q in r and A2: r in R by TARSKI:def 4;
(ex s being non  empty  directed (Subset of L) st (r = s & (ex x being (Element of L) st (s = ( { x } "/\" D2 ) & x in D1)))) by A2;
hence thesis by A1;
end;
then reconsider UR = ( union R ) as (Subset of L);
set a = ( sup UR );
A3:  ex_sup_of UR,L by CKB10:1;
A4: (for b being (Element of L) holds (A is_<=_than b implies a <= b))
proof
let b being (Element of L);
assume that
A5: A is_<=_than b;
UR is_<=_than b
proof
let k being (Element of L);
assume k in UR;
then consider k1 being set such that A6: k in k1 and A7: k1 in R by TARSKI:def 4;
consider s being non  empty  directed (Subset of L) such that A8: k1 = s and A9: P[ s ] by A7;
consider x being (Element of L) such that A10: s = ( { x } "/\" D2 ) and x in D1 by A9;
A11: ( { x } "/\" D2 ) = { ( x "/\" d2 ) where d2 is (Element of L): d2 in D2 } by YELLOW_4:42;
( sup s ) in A by A9;
then A12: ( sup s ) <= b by A5,LATTICE3:def 9;
consider d2 being (Element of L) such that A13: k = ( x "/\" d2 ) and d2 in D2 by A6,A8,A10,A11;
( x "/\" d2 ) <= ( sup s ) by A6,A8,A10,A13,CKB4:1,YELLOW_4:1;
hence k <= b by A13,A12,YELLOW_0:def 2;
end;
hence thesis by A3,YELLOW_0:def 9;
end;
A is_<=_than a
proof
let b being (Element of L);
assume b in A;
then consider X being non  empty  directed (Subset of L) such that A14: b = ( sup X ) and A15: P[ X ];
( ex_sup_of X,L & X in R) by A15,WAYBEL_0:75;
hence b <= a by A3,A14,YELLOW_0:34,ZFMISC_1:74;
