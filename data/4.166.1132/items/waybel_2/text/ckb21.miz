theorem
Th15: (for H being  distributive  complete LATTICE holds (for a being (Element of H) holds (for X being  finite (Subset of H) holds ( sup ( { a } "/\" X ) ) = ( a "/\" ( sup X ) ))))
proof
let H being  distributive  complete LATTICE;
let a being (Element of H);
let X being  finite (Subset of H);
defpred P[ set ]
 means
(ex A being (Subset of H) st (A = $1 & ( a "/\" ( sup A ) ) = ( sup ( { a } "/\" A ) )));
A1: P[ ( {} ) ]
proof
reconsider A = ( {} ) as (Subset of H) by XBOOLE_1:2;
take A;
thus A = ( {} );
(( Bottom H ) <= a & ( { a } "/\" ( {} H ) ) = ( {} )) by YELLOW_0:44,YELLOW_4:36;
hence thesis by YELLOW_0:25;
end;
A2: (for x,B being set holds (((x in X & B c= X) & P[ B ]) implies P[ ( B \/ { x } ) ]))
proof
let x being set,B being set;
assume that
A3: x in X
and
A4: B c= X
and
A5: P[ B ];
reconsider x1 = x as (Element of H) by A3;
A6: { x1 } c= (the carrier of H);
B c= (the carrier of H) by A4,XBOOLE_1:1;
then reconsider C = ( B \/ { x } ) as (Subset of H) by A6,XBOOLE_1:8;
take C;
thus C = ( B \/ { x } );
consider A being (Subset of H) such that A7: A = B and A8: ( a "/\" ( sup A ) ) = ( sup ( { a } "/\" A ) ) by A5;
A9: ( { a } "/\" C ) = ( ( { a } "/\" A ) \/ ( { a } "/\" { x1 } ) ) by A7,YELLOW_4:43
.= ( ( { a } "/\" A ) \/ { ( a "/\" x1 ) } ) by YELLOW_4:46;
A10: ( ex_sup_of ( { a } "/\" A ),H &  ex_sup_of { ( a "/\" x1 ) },H) by YELLOW_0:17;
( ex_sup_of B,H &  ex_sup_of { x },H) by YELLOW_0:17;
hence ( a "/\" ( sup C ) ) = ( a "/\" ( ( "\/" (B,H) ) "\/" ( "\/" ({ x },H) ) ) ) by YELLOW_2:3
.= ( ( sup ( { a } "/\" A ) ) "\/" ( a "/\" ( "\/" ({ x },H) ) ) ) by A7,A8,WAYBEL_1:def 3
.= ( ( sup ( { a } "/\" A ) ) "\/" ( a "/\" x1 ) ) by YELLOW_0:39
.= ( ( sup ( { a } "/\" A ) ) "\/" ( sup { ( a "/\" x1 ) } ) ) by YELLOW_0:39
.= ( sup ( { a } "/\" C ) ) by A10,A9,YELLOW_2:3;
end;
A11: X is  finite;
P[ X ] from FINSET_1:sch 2(A11,A1,A2);
hence thesis;
