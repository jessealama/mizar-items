theorem
Th48: (for L being  complete Semilattice holds ((for x being (Element of L) holds (for J being set holds (for f being (Function of J,(the carrier of L)) holds ( x "/\" ( Sup f ) ) = ( sup ( x "/\" ( FinSups f ) ) )))) implies (for x being (Element of L) holds (for N being (prenet of L) holds (N is  eventually-directed implies ( x "/\" ( sup N ) ) = ( sup ( { x } "/\" ( rng ( netmap (N,L) ) ) ) ))))))
proof
let L being  complete Semilattice;
assume that
A1: (for x being (Element of L) holds (for J being set holds (for f being (Function of J,(the carrier of L)) holds ( x "/\" ( Sup f ) ) = ( sup ( x "/\" ( FinSups f ) ) ))));
let x being (Element of L);
let N being (prenet of L);
assume that
A2: N is  eventually-directed;
reconsider R = ( rng ( netmap (N,L) ) ) as non  empty  directed (Subset of L) by A2,CKB25:1;

A4: ( rng (the mapping of ( x "/\" ( FinSups f ) )) ) is_<=_than ( sup ( { x } "/\" ( rng ( netmap (N,L) ) ) ) )
proof
let a being (Element of L);
A5: ( { x } "/\" ( rng h ) ) = { ( x "/\" y ) where y is (Element of L): y in ( rng h ) } by YELLOW_4:42;
assume a in ( rng (the mapping of ( x "/\" ( FinSups f ) )) );
then a in ( { x } "/\" ( rng h ) ) by CKB36:1;

(for x being set holds  ex_sup_of ( f .: x ),L) by YELLOW_0:17;
then ( rng ( netmap (( FinSups f ),L) ) ) c= ( finsups ( rng f ) ) by CKB37:1;
then y in ( finsups ( rng f ) ) by A7;
then consider Y being  finite (Subset of ( rng f )) such that A8: y = ( "\/" (Y,L) ) and A9:  ex_sup_of Y,L;
( rng ( netmap (N,L) ) ) is  directed by A2,CKB25:1;
then consider z being (Element of L) such that A10: z in ( rng f ) and A11: z is_>=_than Y by WAYBEL_0:1;
A12: x <= x;
( "\/" (Y,L) ) <= z by A9,A11,YELLOW_0:30;
then A13: ( x "/\" y ) <= ( x "/\" z ) by A8,A12,YELLOW_3:2;
x in { x } by TARSKI:def 1;
then ( x "/\" z ) <= ( sup ( xx "/\" ( rng f ) ) ) by A3,A10,YELLOW_4:1,YELLOW_4:37;
hence a <= ( sup ( { x } "/\" ( rng ( netmap (N,L) ) ) ) ) by A6,A13,YELLOW_0:def 2;
end;
( x "/\" ( FinSups f ) ) is  eventually-directed by CKB40:1;
then ( rng ( netmap (( x "/\" ( FinSups f ) ),L) ) ) is  directed by CKB25:1;
then  ex_sup_of ( rng (the mapping of ( x "/\" ( FinSups f ) )) ),L by WAYBEL_0:75;
then (( sup ( x "/\" ( FinSups f ) ) ) = ( "\/" (( rng (the mapping of ( x "/\" ( FinSups f ) )) ),L) ) & ( "\/" (( rng (the mapping of ( x "/\" ( FinSups f ) )) ),L) ) <= ( sup ( { x } "/\" ( rng ( netmap (N,L) ) ) ) )) by A4,YELLOW_0:def 9,YELLOW_2:def 5;
then A14: ( x "/\" ( Sup ( netmap (N,L) ) ) ) <= ( sup ( { x } "/\" ( rng ( netmap (N,L) ) ) ) ) by A1;
( ex_sup_of R,L & ( Sup ( netmap (N,L) ) ) = ( "\/" (( rng ( netmap (N,L) ) ),L) )) by WAYBEL_0:75,YELLOW_2:def 5;
then ( sup ( { x } "/\" ( rng ( netmap (N,L) ) ) ) ) <= ( x "/\" ( Sup ( netmap (N,L) ) ) ) by A3,YELLOW_4:53;
hence thesis by A14,ORDERS_2:2;
