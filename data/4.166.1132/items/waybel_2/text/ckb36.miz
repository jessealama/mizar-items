theorem
Th23: (for L being non  empty RelStr holds (for x being (Element of L) holds (for F being non  empty NetStr over L holds ( rng (the mapping of ( x "/\" F )) ) = ( { x } "/\" ( rng (the mapping of F) ) ))))
proof
let L being non  empty RelStr;
let x being (Element of L);
let F being non  empty NetStr over L;
set f = (the mapping of F);
set h = (the mapping of ( x "/\" F ));
set A = ( rng (the mapping of F) );
A1: ( { x } "/\" A ) = { ( x "/\" y ) where y is (Element of L): y in A } by YELLOW_4:42;
A2: ( the RelStr of ( x "/\" F ) ) = ( the RelStr of F ) by CKB32:def 1;
then A3: ( dom h ) = (the carrier of F) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A4: ( dom f ) = (the carrier of F) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
thus ( rng (the mapping of ( x "/\" F )) ) c= ( { x } "/\" A )
proof
let q being set;
assume q in ( rng h );
then consider a being set such that A5: a in ( dom h ) and A6: q = ( h . a ) by FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider a as (Element of ( x "/\" F )) by A5;
consider y being (Element of L) such that A7: y = ( f . a ) and A8: ( h . a ) = ( x "/\" y ) by CKB32:def 1;
y in A by A2,A4,A7,FUNCT_1:def 3;
hence thesis by A1,A6,A8;
end;

let q being set;
assume q in ( { x } "/\" A );
then consider y being (Element of L) such that A9: q = ( x "/\" y ) and A10: y in A by A1;
consider z being set such that A11: z in ( dom f ) and A12: y = ( f . z ) by A10,FUNCT_1:def 3;
reconsider z as (Element of ( x "/\" F )) by A2,A11;
(ex w being (Element of L) st (w = ( f . z ) & ( h . z ) = ( x "/\" w ))) by CKB32:def 1;
hence thesis by A3,A9,A11,A12,FUNCT_1:def 3;
