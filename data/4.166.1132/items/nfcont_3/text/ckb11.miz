theorem
Th10: (for S holds (for f holds (for x0 holds (f is_continuous_in x0 iff (x0 in ( dom f ) & (for N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 )) holds (ex N being (Neighbourhood of x0) st ( f .: N ) c= N1)))))))
proof
let S;
let f;
let x0;
thus (f is_continuous_in x0 implies (x0 in ( dom f ) & (for N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 )) holds (ex N being (Neighbourhood of x0) st ( f .: N ) c= N1))))
proof
assume A1: f is_continuous_in x0;
hence x0 in ( dom f ) by CKB6:def 1;
let N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 ));
consider N being (Neighbourhood of x0) such that A2: (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & x1 in N) implies ( f /. x1 ) in N1)) by A1,CKB10:1;
take N;
now
let r being set;
assume r in ( f .: N );
then consider x being (Element of ( REAL )) such that A3: ((x in ( dom f ) & x in N) & r = ( f . x )) by PARTFUN2:59;
r = ( f /. x ) by A3,PARTFUN1:def 6;
hence r in N1 by A2,A3;
end;
hence thesis by TARSKI:def 3;

assume A4: (x0 in ( dom f ) & (for N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 )) holds (ex N being (Neighbourhood of x0) st ( f .: N ) c= N1)));
now
let N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 ));
consider N being (Neighbourhood of x0) such that A5: ( f .: N ) c= N1 by A4;
take N;
let x1;
assume A6: (x1 in ( dom f ) & x1 in N);
then ( f . x1 ) in ( f .: N ) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
then ( f /. x1 ) in ( f .: N ) by A6,PARTFUN1:def 6;
hence ( f /. x1 ) in N1 by A5;
end;
hence thesis by A4,CKB10:1;
