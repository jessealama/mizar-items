theorem
Th9: (for S holds (for f holds (for x0 holds (f is_continuous_in x0 iff (x0 in ( dom f ) & (for N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 )) holds (ex N being (Neighbourhood of x0) st (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & x1 in N) implies ( f /. x1 ) in N1)))))))))
proof
let S;
let f;
let x0;
thus (f is_continuous_in x0 implies (x0 in ( dom f ) & (for N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 )) holds (ex N being (Neighbourhood of x0) st (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & x1 in N) implies ( f /. x1 ) in N1))))))
proof
assume A1: f is_continuous_in x0;
hence x0 in ( dom f ) by CKB6:def 1;
let N01 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 ));
consider r such that A2: ( 0 ) < r and A3: { p where p is (Point of S): ||. ( p - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r } c= N01 by NFCONT_1:def 1;
set N1 = { p where p is (Point of S): ||. ( p - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r };
consider s such that A4: ( 0 ) < s and A5: (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & ( abs ( x1 - x0 ) ) < s) implies ||. ( ( f /. x1 ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r)) by A1,A2,CKB9:1;
reconsider N = ]. ( x0 - s ),( x0 + s ) .[ as (Neighbourhood of x0) by A4,RCOMP_1:def 6;
take N;
let x1;
assume that
A6: x1 in ( dom f )
and
A7: x1 in N;
( abs ( x1 - x0 ) ) < s by A7,RCOMP_1:1;
then ||. ( ( f /. x1 ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r by A5,A6;
then ( f /. x1 ) in N1;
hence thesis by A3;
end;

assume A8: (x0 in ( dom f ) & (for N1 being (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 )) holds (ex N being (Neighbourhood of x0) st (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & x1 in N) implies ( f /. x1 ) in N1)))));
now
let r;
assume ( 0 ) < r;
then reconsider N1 = { p where p is (Point of S): ||. ( p - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r } as (Neighbourhood of ( f /. x0 )) by NFCONT_1:3;
consider N2 being (Neighbourhood of x0) such that A9: (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & x1 in N2) implies ( f /. x1 ) in N1)) by A8;
consider s being  real number such that A10: ( 0 ) < s and A11: N2 = ]. ( x0 - s ),( x0 + s ) .[ by RCOMP_1:def 6;
take s;
(for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & ( abs ( x1 - x0 ) ) < s) implies ||. ( ( f /. x1 ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r))
proof
let x1;
assume that
A12: x1 in ( dom f )
and
A13: ( abs ( x1 - x0 ) ) < s;
x1 in N2 by A11,A13,RCOMP_1:1;
then ( f /. x1 ) in N1 by A9,A12;
then (ex p being (Point of S) st (p = ( f /. x1 ) & ||. ( p - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r));
hence thesis;
end;
hence (( 0 ) < s & (for x1 holds ((x1 in ( dom f ) & ( abs ( x1 - x0 ) ) < s) implies ||. ( ( f /. x1 ) - ( f /. x0 ) ) .|| < r))) by A10;
end;
hence thesis by A8,CKB9:1;
