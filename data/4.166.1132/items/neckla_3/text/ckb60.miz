theorem
(for R being RelStr holds (R in ( fin_RelStr_sp ) implies R is  symmetric))
proof
let X being RelStr;
assume A1: X in ( fin_RelStr_sp );
per cases ;
suppose A2: X is  trivial;

thus thesis
proof
per cases  by A2,ZFMISC_1:131;
suppose A3: (the carrier of X) is  empty;

let a being set,b being set;
assume that

and
[ a,b ] in (the InternalRel of X);
thus thesis by A3,A4;
end;
suppose (ex x being set st (the carrier of X) = { x });

then consider x being set such that A5: (the carrier of X) = { x };
A6: [: (the carrier of X),(the carrier of X) :] = { [ x,x ] } by A5,ZFMISC_1:29;
thus thesis
proof
per cases  by A6,ZFMISC_1:33;
suppose A7: (the InternalRel of X) = ( {} );

let a being set,b being set;
assume that
a in (the carrier of X)
and
