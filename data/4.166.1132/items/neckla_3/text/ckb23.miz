theorem
Th9: (for G being  irreflexive RelStr holds (for G1,G2 being RelStr holds ((G = ( union_of (G1,G2) ) or G = ( sum_of (G1,G2) )) implies (G1 is  irreflexive & G2 is  irreflexive))))
proof
let G being  irreflexive RelStr;
let G1 being RelStr,G2 being RelStr;
assume A1: (G = ( union_of (G1,G2) ) or G = ( sum_of (G1,G2) ));
per cases  by A1;
suppose A2: G = ( union_of (G1,G2) );

assume A3: (not thesis);
thus thesis
proof
per cases  by A3;
suppose (not G1 is  irreflexive);

then consider x being set such that A4: x in (the carrier of G1) and A5: [ x,x ] in (the InternalRel of G1) by NECKLACE:def 5;
[ x,x ] in ( (the InternalRel of G1) \/ (the InternalRel of G2) ) by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then A6: [ x,x ] in (the InternalRel of G) by A2,NECKLA_2:def 2;
x in ( (the carrier of G1) \/ (the carrier of G2) ) by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then x in (the carrier of G) by A2,NECKLA_2:def 2;
hence thesis by A6,NECKLACE:def 5;
end;
suppose (not G2 is  irreflexive);

then consider x being set such that A7: x in (the carrier of G2) and A8: [ x,x ] in (the InternalRel of G2) by NECKLACE:def 5;
[ x,x ] in ( (the InternalRel of G1) \/ (the InternalRel of G2) ) by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then A9: [ x,x ] in (the InternalRel of G) by A2,NECKLA_2:def 2;
x in ( (the carrier of G1) \/ (the carrier of G2) ) by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
then x in (the carrier of G) by A2,NECKLA_2:def 2;
hence thesis by A9,NECKLACE:def 5;
end;
end;
