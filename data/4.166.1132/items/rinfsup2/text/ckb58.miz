theorem
Th40: (for seq being ExtREAL_sequence holds (seq is  convergent iff ( lim_inf seq ) = ( lim_sup seq )))
proof
let seq being ExtREAL_sequence;
set a = ( lim_inf seq );
thus (seq is  convergent implies ( lim_inf seq ) = ( lim_sup seq ))
proof
assume A1: seq is  convergent;
per cases  by A1,MESFUNC5:def 11;
suppose A2: seq is  convergent_to_finite_number;

then consider k being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A3: ( seq ^\ k ) is  bounded by CKB32:1;
reconsider rseq0 = ( seq ^\ k ) as Real_Sequence by A3,CKB24:1;
( seq ^\ k ) is  convergent_to_finite_number by A2,CKB33:1;
then A4: rseq0 is  convergent by CKB28:1;
then A5: rseq0 is  bounded;
then ( lim_sup rseq0 ) = ( lim_sup ( seq ^\ k ) ) by CKB22:1;
then A6: ( lim_sup rseq0 ) = ( lim_sup seq ) by CKB41:1;
( lim_inf rseq0 ) = ( lim_inf ( seq ^\ k ) ) by A5,CKB23:1;
then ( lim_inf rseq0 ) = ( lim_inf seq ) by CKB42:1;
hence thesis by A4,A6,RINFSUP1:88;
end;
suppose A7: seq is  convergent_to_-infty;

now
let g being  real number;
assume g < ( 0 );
then consider n being Nat such that A8: (for m being Nat holds (n <= m implies ( seq . m ) <= g)) by A7,MESFUNC5:def 10;
now
let m being Nat;
m is (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
then A9: ( ( inferior_realsequence seq ) . m ) <= ( seq . m ) by CKB15:1;
assume n <= m;
then ( seq . m ) <= g by A8;
hence ( ( inferior_realsequence seq ) . m ) <= g by A9,XXREAL_0:2;
end;
hence (ex n being Nat st (for m being Nat holds (n <= m implies ( ( inferior_realsequence seq ) . m ) <= g)));
end;
then A10: ( inferior_realsequence seq ) is  convergent_to_-infty by MESFUNC5:def 10;
then ( inferior_realsequence seq ) is  convergent by MESFUNC5:def 11;
then ( lim ( inferior_realsequence seq ) ) = ( -infty ) by A10,MESFUNC5:def 12;
then A11: ( lim_inf seq ) = ( -infty ) by CKB52:1;
A12: ( superior_realsequence seq ) is  convergent_to_-infty
proof
set iseq = ( superior_realsequence seq );
assume (not iseq is  convergent_to_-infty);
then consider g being  real number such that A13: g < ( 0 ) and A14: (for n being Nat holds (ex m being Nat st (n <= m & g < ( iseq . m )))) by MESFUNC5:def 10;
consider N being Nat such that A15: (for m being Nat holds (N <= m implies ( seq . m ) <= g)) by A7,A13,MESFUNC5:def 10;
now
let m being Nat;
m is (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
then consider Y being non  empty (Subset of ( ExtREAL )) such that A16: Y = { ( seq . k ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): m <= k } and A17: ( ( superior_realsequence seq ) . m ) = ( sup Y ) by CKB12:def 1;
assume A18: N <= m;
now
let x being  ext-real number;
assume x in Y;
then consider k being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A19: x = ( seq . k ) and A20: m <= k by A16;
N <= k by A18,A20,XXREAL_0:2;
hence x <= g by A15,A19;
end;
then g is (UpperBound of Y) by XXREAL_2:def 1;
hence ( iseq . m ) <= g by A17,XXREAL_2:def 3;
end;
hence contradiction by A14;
end;
then ( superior_realsequence seq ) is  convergent by MESFUNC5:def 11;
then ( lim ( superior_realsequence seq ) ) = ( -infty ) by A12,MESFUNC5:def 12;
hence thesis by A11,CKB51:1;
end;
suppose A21: seq is  convergent_to_+infty;

now
let g being  real number;
assume ( 0 ) < g;
then consider n being Nat such that A22: (for m being Nat holds (n <= m implies g <= ( seq . m ))) by A21,MESFUNC5:def 9;
now
let m being Nat;
m is (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
then A23: ( seq . m ) <= ( ( superior_realsequence seq ) . m ) by CKB15:1;
assume n <= m;
then g <= ( seq . m ) by A22;
hence g <= ( ( superior_realsequence seq ) . m ) by A23,XXREAL_0:2;
end;
hence (ex n being Nat st (for m being Nat holds (n <= m implies g <= ( ( superior_realsequence seq ) . m ))));
end;
then A24: ( superior_realsequence seq ) is  convergent_to_+infty by MESFUNC5:def 9;
then ( superior_realsequence seq ) is  convergent by MESFUNC5:def 11;
then ( lim ( superior_realsequence seq ) ) = ( +infty ) by A24,MESFUNC5:def 12;
then A25: ( lim_sup seq ) = ( +infty ) by CKB51:1;
A26: ( inferior_realsequence seq ) is  convergent_to_+infty
proof
set iseq = ( inferior_realsequence seq );
assume (not iseq is  convergent_to_+infty);
then consider g being  real number such that A27: ( 0 ) < g and A28: (for n being Nat holds (ex m being Nat st (n <= m & ( iseq . m ) < g))) by MESFUNC5:def 9;
consider N being Nat such that A29: (for m being Nat holds (N <= m implies g <= ( seq . m ))) by A21,A27,MESFUNC5:def 9;
now
let m being Nat;
m is (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
then consider Y being non  empty (Subset of ( ExtREAL )) such that A30: Y = { ( seq . k ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): m <= k } and A31: ( ( inferior_realsequence seq ) . m ) = ( inf Y ) by CKB11:def 1;
assume A32: N <= m;
now
let x being  ext-real number;
assume x in Y;
then consider k being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A33: x = ( seq . k ) and A34: m <= k by A30;
N <= k by A32,A34,XXREAL_0:2;
hence g <= x by A29,A33;
end;
then g is (LowerBound of Y) by XXREAL_2:def 2;
hence g <= ( iseq . m ) by A31,XXREAL_2:def 4;
end;
hence contradiction by A28;
end;
then ( inferior_realsequence seq ) is  convergent by MESFUNC5:def 11;
then ( lim ( inferior_realsequence seq ) ) = ( +infty ) by A26,MESFUNC5:def 12;
hence thesis by A25,CKB52:1;
end;
end;

assume A35: ( lim_inf seq ) = ( lim_sup seq );
per cases  by XXREAL_0:14;
suppose a in ( REAL );

hence thesis by A35,CKB57:1;
end;
suppose a = ( +infty );

hence thesis by A35,CKB55:1;
