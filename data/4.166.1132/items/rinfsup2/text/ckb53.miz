theorem
Th38: (for seq1,seq2 being ExtREAL_sequence holds (((seq1 is  convergent & seq2 is  convergent) & (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( seq1 . n ) <= ( seq2 . n ))) implies ( lim seq1 ) <= ( lim seq2 )))
proof
let seq1 being ExtREAL_sequence;
let seq2 being ExtREAL_sequence;
assume that
A1: seq1 is  convergent
and
A2: seq2 is  convergent
and
A3: (for n being (Element of ( NAT )) holds ( seq1 . n ) <= ( seq2 . n ));
per cases  by A1,MESFUNC5:def 11;
suppose A4: seq1 is  convergent_to_finite_number;

A5: (not seq2 is  convergent_to_-infty)
proof
assume A6: seq2 is  convergent_to_-infty;
now
let g being  real number;
assume g < ( 0 );
then consider n being Nat such that A7: (for m being Nat holds (n <= m implies ( seq2 . m ) <= g)) by A6,MESFUNC5:def 10;
now
let m being Nat;
m is (Element of ( NAT )) by ORDINAL1:def 12;
then A8: ( seq1 . m ) <= ( seq2 . m ) by A3;
assume n <= m;
then ( seq2 . m ) <= g by A7;
hence ( seq1 . m ) <= g by A8,XXREAL_0:2;
end;
hence (ex n being Nat st (for m being Nat holds (n <= m implies ( seq1 . m ) <= g)));
end;
then seq1 is  convergent_to_-infty by MESFUNC5:def 10;
hence contradiction by A4,MESFUNC5:51;
