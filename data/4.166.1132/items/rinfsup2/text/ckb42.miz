theorem
Th29: (for seq being ExtREAL_sequence holds (for j being (Element of ( NAT )) holds (( inferior_realsequence ( seq ^\ j ) ) = ( ( inferior_realsequence seq ) ^\ j ) & ( lim_inf ( seq ^\ j ) ) = ( lim_inf seq ))))
proof
let seq being ExtREAL_sequence;
let j being (Element of ( NAT ));
set rseq = ( seq ^\ j );
now
let n being (Element of ( NAT ));
A1: (ex Y2 being non  empty (Subset of ( ExtREAL )) st (Y2 = { ( rseq . k ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k } & ( ( inferior_realsequence rseq ) . n ) = ( inf Y2 ))) by CKB11:def 1;
A2: (ex Y3 being non  empty (Subset of ( ExtREAL )) st (Y3 = { ( seq . k ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): ( j + n ) <= k } & ( ( inferior_realsequence seq ) . ( j + n ) ) = ( inf Y3 ))) by CKB11:def 1;
now
let x being set;
assume x in { ( seq . k ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): ( j + n ) <= k };
then consider k being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A3: x = ( seq . k ) and A4: ( j + n ) <= k;
j <= ( j + n ) by NAT_1:11;
then reconsider k1 = ( k - j ) as (Element of ( NAT )) by A4,INT_1:5,XXREAL_0:2;
A5: x = ( seq . ( j + k1 ) ) by A3;
( ( j + n ) - j ) <= ( k - j ) by A4,XREAL_1:9;
hence x in { ( seq . ( j + k2 ) ) where k2 is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k2 } by A5;
end;
then A6: { ( seq . k ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): ( j + n ) <= k } c= { ( seq . ( j + k ) ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k } by TARSKI:def 3;
now
let x being set;
assume x in { ( seq . ( j + k ) ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k };
then consider k being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A7: x = ( seq . ( j + k ) ) and A8: n <= k;
( j + n ) <= ( j + k ) by A8,XREAL_1:6;
hence x in { ( seq . k1 ) where k1 is (Element of ( NAT )): ( j + n ) <= k1 } by A7;
end;
then { ( seq . ( j + k ) ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k } c= { ( seq . k ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): ( j + n ) <= k } by TARSKI:def 3;
then A9: { ( seq . ( j + k ) ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k } = { ( seq . k ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): ( j + n ) <= k } by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
now
let x being set;
assume x in { ( seq . ( j + k ) ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k };
then consider k being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A10: x = ( seq . ( j + k ) ) and A11: n <= k;
x = ( rseq . k ) by A10,NAT_1:def 3;
hence x in { ( rseq . k1 ) where k1 is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k1 } by A11;
end;
then A12: { ( seq . ( j + k ) ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k } c= { ( rseq . k ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k } by TARSKI:def 3;
now
let x being set;
assume x in { ( rseq . k ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k };
then consider k being (Element of ( NAT )) such that A13: x = ( rseq . k ) and A14: n <= k;
x = ( seq . ( j + k ) ) by A13,NAT_1:def 3;
hence x in { ( seq . ( j + k1 ) ) where k1 is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k1 } by A14;
end;
then { ( rseq . k ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k } c= { ( seq . ( j + k ) ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k } by TARSKI:def 3;
then { ( rseq . k ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k } = { ( seq . ( j + k ) ) where k is (Element of ( NAT )): n <= k } by A12,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
hence ( ( inferior_realsequence rseq ) . n ) = ( ( ( inferior_realsequence seq ) ^\ j ) . n ) by A1,A2,A9,NAT_1:def 3;
end;
then ( ( inferior_realsequence seq ) ^\ j ) = ( inferior_realsequence rseq ) by FUNCT_2:63;
hence thesis by CKB39:1;
