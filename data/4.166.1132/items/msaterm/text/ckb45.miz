theorem
Th26: (for S being non  void non  empty ManySortedSign holds (for V1,V2 being  non-empty (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of S)) holds (V1 c= V2 implies (for t being (Term of S,V1) holds t is (Term of S,V2)))))
proof
let S being non  void non  empty ManySortedSign;
let V1 being  non-empty (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of S));
let V2 being  non-empty (ManySortedSet of (the carrier of S));
assume that
A1: (for s being set holds (s in (the carrier of S) implies ( V1 . s ) c= ( V2 . s )));
defpred P[ set ]
 means
$1 is (Term of S,V2);
A2: (for o being (OperSymbol of S) holds (for p being (ArgumentSeq of ( Sym (o,V1) )) holds ((for t being (Term of S,V1) holds (t in ( rng p ) implies P[ t ])) implies P[ ( [ o,(the carrier of S) ] -tree p ) ])))
proof
let o being (OperSymbol of S);
let p being (ArgumentSeq of ( Sym (o,V1) ));
assume A3: (for t being (Term of S,V1) holds (t in ( rng p ) implies t is (Term of S,V2)));
( rng p ) c= ( S -Terms V2 )
proof
let x being set;
assume A4: x in ( rng p );
( rng p ) c= ( S -Terms V1 ) by FINSEQ_1:def 4;
then reconsider x as (Term of S,V1) by A4;
x is (Term of S,V2) by A3,A4;
hence thesis;
end;
then reconsider q = p as (FinSequence of ( S -Terms V2 )) by FINSEQ_1:def 4;
A5:now
let i being Nat;
assume A6: i in ( dom q );
then consider t being (Term of S,V1) such that A7: t = ( q . i ) and t = ( (p qua (FinSequence of (( S -Terms V1 ) qua non  empty set))) /. i ) and A8: ( the_sort_of t ) = ( ( the_arity_of o ) . i ) and ( the_sort_of t ) = ( ( the_arity_of o ) /. i ) by CKB40:1;
t in ( rng p ) by A6,A7,FUNCT_1:def 3;
then reconsider T = t as (Term of S,V2) by A3;
take T;
thus T = ( q . i ) by A7;
thus ( the_sort_of T ) = ( ( the_arity_of o ) . i )
proof
per cases  by CKB14:1;
suppose (ex s being (SortSymbol of S) st (ex v being (Element of ( V1 . s )) st ( t . ( {} ) ) = [ v,s ]));

then consider s being (SortSymbol of S),v being (Element of ( V1 . s )) such that A9: ( t . ( {} ) ) = [ v,s ];
A10: t = ( root-tree [ v,s ] ) by A9,CKB17:1;
( V1 . s ) c= ( V2 . s ) by A1;
then v in ( V2 . s ) by TARSKI:def 3;
hence ( the_sort_of T ) = s by A10,CKB32:1
.= ( ( the_arity_of o ) . i ) by A8,A10,CKB32:1;
end;
suppose ( t . ( {} ) ) in [: (the carrier' of S),{ (the carrier of S) } :];

then consider o9 being (OperSymbol of S),x2 being (Element of { (the carrier of S) }) such that A11: ( t . ( {} ) ) = [ o9,x2 ] by DOMAIN_1:1;
A12: x2 = (the carrier of S) by TARSKI:def 1;
hence ( the_sort_of T ) = ( the_result_sort_of o9 ) by A11,CKB35:1
.= ( ( the_arity_of o ) . i ) by A8,A11,A12,CKB35:1;
end;
end;

end;
( len p ) = ( len ( the_arity_of o ) ) by CKB40:1;
then q is (ArgumentSeq of ( Sym (o,V2) )) by A5,CKB43:1;
hence thesis by CKB7:1;
end;
A13: (for s being (SortSymbol of S) holds (for v being (Element of ( V1 . s )) holds P[ ( root-tree [ v,s ] ) ]))
proof
let s being (SortSymbol of S);
let v being (Element of ( V1 . s ));
( V1 . s ) c= ( V2 . s ) by A1;
then v in ( V2 . s ) by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis by CKB16:1;
end;
(for t being (Term of S,V1) holds P[ t ]) from CKB8:sch 1(A13,A2);
hence thesis;
