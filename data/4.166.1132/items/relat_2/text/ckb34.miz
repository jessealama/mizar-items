theorem
((P is  symmetric & R is  symmetric) implies ((( P \/ R ) is  symmetric & ( P /\ R ) is  symmetric) & ( P \ R ) is  symmetric))
proof
assume that
A1: P is  symmetric
and
A2: R is  symmetric;
A3: R is_symmetric_in ( field R ) by A2,CKB11:def 1;
A4: P is_symmetric_in ( field P ) by A1,CKB11:def 1;
now
let a;
let b;
assume that
a in ( field ( P \/ R ) )
and
b in ( field ( P \/ R ) )
and
A5: [ a,b ] in ( P \/ R );
A6:now
assume A7: [ a,b ] in R;
then (a in ( field R ) & b in ( field R )) by RELAT_1:15;
then [ b,a ] in R by A3,A7,CKB3:def 1;
hence [ b,a ] in ( P \/ R ) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
now
assume A8: [ a,b ] in P;
then (a in ( field P ) & b in ( field P )) by RELAT_1:15;
then [ b,a ] in P by A4,A8,CKB3:def 1;
hence [ b,a ] in ( P \/ R ) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
hence [ b,a ] in ( P \/ R ) by A5,A6,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
end;
then ( P \/ R ) is_symmetric_in ( field ( P \/ R ) ) by CKB3:def 1;
hence ( P \/ R ) is  symmetric by CKB11:def 1;
now
let a;
let b;
assume that
A9: (a in ( field ( P /\ R ) ) & b in ( field ( P /\ R ) ))
and
A10: [ a,b ] in ( P /\ R );
A11: [ a,b ] in R by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A12: ( field ( P /\ R ) ) c= ( ( field P ) /\ ( field R ) ) by RELAT_1:19;
then (a in ( field R ) & b in ( field R )) by A9,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A13: [ b,a ] in R by A3,A11,CKB3:def 1;
A14: [ a,b ] in P by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
(a in ( field P ) & b in ( field P )) by A12,A9,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then [ b,a ] in P by A4,A14,CKB3:def 1;
hence [ b,a ] in ( P /\ R ) by A13,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;
then ( P /\ R ) is_symmetric_in ( field ( P /\ R ) ) by CKB3:def 1;
hence ( P /\ R ) is  symmetric by CKB11:def 1;
now
let a;
let b;
assume that
a in ( field ( P \ R ) )
and
b in ( field ( P \ R ) )
and
A15: [ a,b ] in ( P \ R );
(not [ a,b ] in R) by A15,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then A16: (((not b in ( field R )) or (not a in ( field R ))) or (not [ b,a ] in R)) by A3,CKB3:def 1;
A17: [ a,b ] in P by A15,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
then (a in ( field P ) & b in ( field P )) by RELAT_1:15;
then A18: [ b,a ] in P by A4,A17,CKB3:def 1;
(((not b in ( field R )) or (not a in ( field R ))) implies (not [ b,a ] in R)) by RELAT_1:15;
hence [ b,a ] in ( P \ R ) by A18,A16,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
end;
then ( P \ R ) is_symmetric_in ( field ( P \ R ) ) by CKB3:def 1;
hence thesis by CKB11:def 1;
